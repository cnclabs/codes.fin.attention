product rights customers may license rights to use single images  film clips or multiple images through subscriptions or cds 
ownership of imagery does not pass to customers who license the imagery 
licensing methods customers may license images using one of three licensing methods rights managed  royalty free or subscription 
we group our creative and moving image collections into categories corresponding to these licensing methods 
creative imagery may be licensed through any of these methods  while editorial imagery may be licensed through subscriptions or rights managed licenses 
for rights managed licensing  the license fee is based on how the image will be used  including geographical distribution  license duration  medium  exclusivity and circulation 
for example  an image to be used as an eighth of a page photo in a brochure to be distributed in one city for three months will cost less to license than an image to be used in a global advertising campaign for a year 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part i item that includes print advertising  billboards and point of purchase displays 
we also offer flexible license packs  which provide customers a quick and cost effective way to license an image for multiple preset media without having to enter into separate license agreements 
for royalty free licensing  the license fee is based on the size of the digital file  from standard resolution generally one to three megabytes to high resolution generally megabytes 
once the customer has licensed an image  that customer may use that image multiple times for multiple projects without paying additional fees 
royalty free images may be licensed on a single image basis or as part of a collection of images on a cd or virtual cd a group of images offered online for one fee or through a subscription 
subscription licensing is available for selected editorial and royalty free creative images 
under this licensing method  customers pay a periodic fee and then may utilize the images as they require during the subscription period

this authority  together with certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
this could occur even if our stockholders consider such change in control to be in their best interests

general overview we are a leading creator and distributor of high quality  relevant imagery and related services to creative professionals at advertising agencies  graphic design firms  corporations  and film and broadcasting companies  editorial customers involved in newspaper  magazine  book  cd rom and online publishing  and corporate marketing departments and other business customers 
our goal is to be the leading image solutions provider in every major market  offering visual communications professionals products and related services at multiple price points on multiple platforms 
we intend to do this by providing high quality  relevant imagery and related services that are easily accessed and easily licensed at multiple price points 
we anticipate that the market for still and moving imagery will grow over the next several years allowing us more opportunities to execute on our strategy 
we believe that the growth will be led by the continued emergence of new communications platforms  growth in internet advertising and increased use of imagery as a communication tool globally 
we are seeing growth in the market for new communications platforms  which we believe  over time  will utilize more visually rich content than others before them 
today  these platforms  namely the internet and mobile devices  have been of limited communication value because of content portability limits 
we believe that  over time  technological advances will lessen these limits and that these platforms and our related offerings  including still and moving imagery  will thrive 
we intend to meet the needs of the users of these platforms with relevant  high quality imagery appropriate for each platform 
for  we have established four key objectives in support of our goal to be the leading image solutions provider in every major market 
these key objectives are to innovate products  services  platforms and markets  accelerate growth in non english speaking countries  revitalize our website with new features and search functionality  and continue to develop a world class selling organization 
innovate products  services  platforms and markets we will continue to offer new and innovative imagery and related services 
we will support innovators of new communications platforms by creating or acquiring high quality imagery appropriate for these platforms and by altering licensing models as necessary 
accelerate growth in non english speaking countries we plan to accelerate growth in licenses of both editorial and creative imagery in non english speaking countries by expanding our product and service offerings in markets that we have not fully penetrated  by creating or acquiring locally relevant imagery and by localizing search capability on our website 
in  we made a small investment in a joint venture  which is now licensing our imagery through a chinese language website 
revitalize our website we already have what we believe to be the best website in the industry for image professionals 
however  we believe that we can improve our customers experience and grow our market share by revitalizing our website with new features and search functionality 

table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item the focus of the revitalization will be localization and personalization and will include customizable search and views  localized search and single search across all content  guided navigation  disambiguation  improved performance and improved digital workflow infrastructure 
continue to develop a world class selling organization our objective in is to continue to develop our selling organization into one that is world class 
achievement of this objective will require structure and process improvements and training on a number of tools to allow sales people to spend less time on administration and more time interacting with customers 
we will also leverage our expertise more  using our creative talent to influence and inspire customers as to the power of imagery 
our ability to meet our objectives is subject to many risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  our ability to provide product offerings that are relevant and desirable in international markets  improve international respect for our copyrights  successfully develop and market new service offerings that complement our existing products and services  and identify and implement new technology 
meeting our objectives is also subject to the general risks discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
revenue we generate our revenue from licensing rights to use imagery and from providing related services 
revenue is principally derived from a large number of relatively small transactions involving licensing rights to use single still images  film clips or cds containing multiple images 
we also generate revenue from subscription image licenses and from custom photo shoots 
in addition to being licensed directly by us  our imagery is also licensed through delegates worldwide 
licenses through delegates comprised approximately of our revenue in delegates typically earn and retain to of the license fee paid by their customers  and we recognize the remaining to as revenue 
still imagery the still imagery that we license can be broken down into three portfolios rights managed  royalty free  and editorial 
rights managed images are licensed by customers on a use by use basis and generally have higher license fees based on the intended use of the image  including medium  geographical distribution  license duration  circulation and level of exclusivity 
royalty free images except for exclusives can be used by customers for multiple projects over an unlimited time period 
license fees for royalty free cds are generally the same for each licensee  while license fees for single royalty free images differ depending on the size of the digital file  from standard resolution generally one to three megabytes to high resolution generally megabytes 
editorial imagery consists of news  sports  entertainment and archival imagery  and is licensed on a single image or subscription basis except for archival 
film we also maintain a portfolio of film  or moving imagery  clips that we license on a rights managed or royalty free basis 
license fees for rights managed and royalty free film clips vary based on the same factors as license fees for images within the respective still imagery portfolios 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of royalties owed to contributors  comprised of photographers  filmmakers and other imagery partners 
these contributors are under contract with us and typically receive royalties of to of the total license fee  depending on the portfolio as discussed above  where the imagery is licensed licenses outside a contributor s home territory result in lower royalties and the terms of their contract 
we own certain of the images in our collections  and these images do not require royalty payments 
cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization 
acquisitions of businesses on april   we acquired london based digital vision limited digital vision  one of the world s leading royalty free photography businesses  for a purchase price of million million of cash and million of direct acquisition costs and liabilities assumed 
the majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill million and identifiable intangible assets million 
prior to the acquisition  we had a significant number of digital vision s images available for license through our image partner program 
we acquired this company in order to obtain more wholly owned imagery  which provides flexible licensing opportunities at a lower cost  as there are no associated royalties

form k part ii item on june   we acquired amana america  inc  amana europe limited and iconica limited collectively photonica for a purchase price of million million of cash and million of direct acquisition costs and liabilities assumed 
photonica is a rights managed stock photography agency with its principal offices in new york and london 
the majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill million and identifiable intangible assets million 
we acquired this company to obtain access to some of the world s leading collections of cutting edge  high end rights managed imagery and some of the most talented and creative photographers in europe  the united states and japan 
on july   we acquired imagenet limited  a london based distributor of digital publicity and marketing materials to media companies  for a purchase price including liabilities assumed of million approximately million 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to goodwill was million approximately million 
during  and  we also completed several other small acquisitions 
all acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired businesses since the respective dates of acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements 
none of the acquisitions were material  individually or in the aggregate  to the company as a whole and  therefore  pro forma financial information is not presented 
results of operations our key objectives for were to grow the volume of imagery licensed  accelerate international growth  continue to grow the editorial portion of our business  improve and customize the customer experience and search capabilities on gettyimages 
com  and achieve a operating margin 
we achieved each of these objectives 
in  compared to we licensed more single still creative images  we grew international revenue approximately excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates and entered into a joint venture in the people s republic of china  editorial revenue increased approximately excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we achieved a operating margin compared to an operating margin of for we also completed a process map of how we will  over the next few years  improve the search functionality  localization and personalization of our website 
we also began implementing certain of these website improvements 
effective with this annual report on form k  we have renamed the line previously labeled cost of sales as cost of revenue  included cost of revenue in the subtotal labeled operating expenses and eliminated the subtotal previously labeled gross margin 
these changes were made to reflect our shift in focus away from gross margin and towards operating margin as a key measure of our financial success 
the content of the cost of revenue line has not changed 
cost of revenue excludes depreciation and amortization 
below are selected financial highlights from our results of operations 
all figures in the tables are shown in thousands  except percentages and price per image figures 
income from operations and operating margin should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance  but should be considered supplemental indicators

the royalty free volume increase was particularly significant in europe  where customers continue to adopt this licensing model 
increases in average price per image arose through a shift in the mix of images licensed within our royalty free portfolio towards higher priced imagery and through selective price increases 
in addition to the success of the royalty free model  the volume of rights managed imagery licensed increased modestly year over year 
revenue from licenses of editorial imagery and film also increased year over year

excluding these changes in exchange rates  revenue increased year over year due mainly to pricing  including selective price increases  reduced levels of discounting for certain uses of rights managed imagery and a shift in the mix of images licensed within our royalty free portfolio towards higher priced imagery 
our editorial imagery portfolio also contributed significantly to year over year revenue growth  due mainly to increases in the volume of images licensed from this portfolio 
we also saw growth in the volume of images licensed from our rights managed imagery portfolio during the year  partially offset in the first half of the year by decreases in the volume of single royalty free images licensed by customers who pay with a credit card

these expectations do not include the impact of stock based compensation  changes in foreign currency exchange rates or material acquisitions of businesses  if any 
the impact of stock based compensation may vary greatly depending on the number of restricted stock units and stock options issued and the future price of our common stock 
however  we currently anticipate that stock based compensation expense will reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately to 
this estimate is based on a range of estimated prices of our common stock and current expectations of the number of restricted stock units and stock options that may be issued

cash flows provided by operating activities operating cash flows increased over the past two years as revenue growth outpaced growth in cash operating expenses  offset in part in by a modest increase in days sales outstanding dsos 
we expect to see operating cash flows continue to increase in but not at a rate as significant as that in and the expected slowing in the growth of operating cash flows in is due primarily to the full utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards in early  which means that we will be paying more income taxes 
cash flows provided by financing activities the primary component of cash provided by financing activities has been proceeds from employee stock option exercises  which can and have fluctuated from year to year 
we anticipate that cash flows provided by financing activities in will continue to consist mainly of proceeds from employee stock option exercises 
stock option exercises typically increase or decrease relative to changes in our stock price 
approximately million stock options were outstanding at december   of which million were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of

we may redeem the debentures for cash equal to the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after june   except that between june  and june   we may not redeem the debentures unless the closing sale price of our common stock is greater than for at least trading days in a consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the date of mailing our notice of redemption 
holders may require us to redeem the debentures for cash equal to the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest on june   and we are required to pay contingent interest beyond the coupon rate at the rate of per year on the average trading price of the debentures over a five day trading period immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period  commencing with the six month period ending december   if such average trading price is greater than or equal to  per debenture 
the market price of our convertible subordinated debentures was approximately  per debenture at december  on july   our convertible subordinated debentures became convertible by the holders due to a conversion condition having been met 
the conversion condition was met when the closing price of our common stock exceeded for trading days within the last trading days ended june  the condition was also met in the quarters ended september  and december  as a result  we classified the million of debentures as short term debt on our june  september and december  balance sheets 
we believe the likelihood of a significant number of debentures being tendered for conversion prior to the date that we are able to call the debentures is remote  however  should all or some of the holders elect to convert  we would be required to repay the applicable principal in cash up to million  which we would likely fund with existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the ability for the holders to convert will expire on march  unless the conversion condition is met again in the last trading days ending on that date 
if the condition is not met during that period  we will reclassify the debt back to long term

the increase in resulted mainly from the acquisition and creation of wholly owned imagery 
wholly owned imagery provides flexible licensing opportunities at a lower cost  as no royalties are required to be paid to contributors 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  however  we plan to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures in  mainly related to the creation of imagery and development of computer software 
the anticipated sources of funds for these capital expenditures are current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows provided by operating activities  but could include any of the sources discussed under liquidity above

form k part ii item contractual obligations and rights the following table illustrates payments and receipts associated with significant  enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations that are non cancelable without significant penalty 
if a contract is cancelable with a penalty  the amount shown in the table below is the full contractual obligation  not the penalty  as we currently intend to fulfill each of these obligations 
years ending december  thereafter total in thousands convertible subordinated debentures principal payments interest payments operating lease payments on facilities and equipment leases minimum royalty guarantee payments to contributors of imagery other purchase commitments total contractual obligations figures assume that the convertible subordinated debentures are repaid upon maturity in  which may or may not reflect future events 
the debentures are currently convertible by the holders of the debentures and therefore  the applicable principal would be required to be paid in cash if some or all of the debentures were converted by the holders 
in addition  the holders may require us to redeem the debentures in  and see discussion of these circumstances under convertible subordinated debentures under cash flows provided by financing activities above 
offsetting these operating lease payments will be receipts for subleased facilities in the amounts of in thousands      and for the years ending december      and thereafter  respectively 
offsetting these minimum royalty guarantee payments to contributors of imagery will be minimum guaranteed receipts from contributors in the amount of in thousands  for the year ending december  payments under purchase orders  certain sponsorships  donations and other commitments that are not enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations are excluded from this table 
payments  guaranteed and contingent  under employment contracts are also excluded from this table because they do not constitute purchase commitments 
guarantees we indemnify certain customers from claims related to alleged infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties  such as claims arising from failure to secure model and property releases for images we license 
the standard terms of these indemnifications require us to defend those claims and pay related damages  if any 
we typically mitigate this risk by securing all necessary model and property releases for imagery for which we hold the copyright  and by contractually requiring our contributing photographers and other imagery partners to do the same prior to submitting any imagery to us 
we also require contributing photographers  other imagery partners and sellers of businesses or image collections that we have purchased to indemnify us in certain circumstances in the event a claim arises in relation to an image they have provided or sold to us 
our imagery partners are also typically required to carry insurance policies for losses related to such claims 
we do not record any liabilities for these indemnifications until claims are made and we are able to assess the range of possible payments and available recourse from our imagery partners  as applicable 
historically  our exposure to such claims has been immaterial  as were our recorded liabilities for intellectual property infringement at december  and as such  we believe the estimated fair value of these liabilities is minimal 
in the ordinary course of business  we also enter into certain types of agreements that contingently require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item agreements with customers other than those licensing images  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use of our products or services  agreements with delegates  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their distribution of our products or services  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to use of their property  agreements with directors and officers  under which we indemnify them to the full extent allowed by delaware law against claims relating to their service to us  agreements with purchasers of businesses we have sold  under which we may indemnify the purchasers against claims arising from our operation of the businesses prior to sale  and agreements with initial purchasers and underwriters of our securities  under which we indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because we do not expect these indemnifications to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no related liabilities were recorded at december  or we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain indemnifications  and historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these obligations 
other potentially significant uses of cash our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of our common stock on the open market from time to time  up to million 
the number of shares purchased  if any  and the timing of the purchases will be based on the level of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  the market price of our common stock  general business conditions and alternative investment opportunities 
we have not repurchased any shares pursuant to this authorization 
we will continue to consider selective acquisitions of businesses 
during  we paid million in cash not including liabilities assumed for acquired businesses 
cash paid for business acquisitions can vary significantly from year to year due to the timing of identifying and completing acquisitions that contribute to the achievement of our objectives 
we have not paid or declared any dividends since inception  and our board of directors does not anticipate changing this practice in the foreseeable future 
subsequent events on february   we purchased all of the shares of istockphoto  inc for million in cash 
istockphoto  inc was a privately held stock photography company located in calgary  alberta  canada that licenses royalty free imagery exclusively through its websites  www 
istockphoto 
com and www 
istockpro 
com 
the million purchase price was funded from existing cash and cash equivalents and consisted of million paid to the sellers upon closing and million held in escrow 
the amounts held in escrow are to be paid to certain key employees former shareholders of istockphoto  inc after they complete one to three years of continued service with the company 
a purchase price allocation is in process and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
following are accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on august and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
when assessing impairment  we estimate the implied fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that involves significant assumptions and estimates  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item including our future financial performance  our future weighted average cost of capital and our interpretation of currently enacted tax laws 
as circumstances change  it is possible that future goodwill impairment tests could result in a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the determination of income from operations 
at august   the implied fair value of our goodwill significantly exceeded its carrying value  therefore goodwill was not impaired 
the balance of goodwill at december  was million 
identifiable intangible assets are assets that do not have physical representation  but that arise from contractual or other legal rights or are capable of being separated or divided from us and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
identifiable intangible assets are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows that we estimate will be generated by the assets and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives see estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets below for more information 
identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the discounted cash flow models we use to determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involve significant assumptions and estimates  including cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  the estimated useful lives of the assets  and our future weighted average cost of capital 
as circumstances change  it is possible that future impairment tests could result in a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the determination of income from operations 
no identifiable intangible assets were impaired during the periods presented 
the majority of the million net book value of our identifiable intangible assets at december  consisted of trademarks  trade names and copyrights million and customer lists  contracts and relationships million 
estimated useful lives of certain long lived assets the estimated useful lives of our most significant property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are discussed below 
should we determine at some point in the future that the useful lives of these assets are shorter than estimated  it is possible that we would be required to accelerate the amortization  or write off an impaired portion  of these assets 
property and equipment the majority of the million net book value of our property and equipment at december  consisted of imagery million  computer hardware and software million and leasehold improvements million 
the estimated useful lives of imagery are determined based on the number of years over which they generate the majority of their revenue 
periodically  we perform analyses of populations of imagery that are representative of all of our contemporary image collections 
these analyses have shown that the average life of contemporary imagery approximates four years 
the estimated useful life of archival imagery is approximately years 
historical revenue may not be indicative of future revenue  and therefore  these estimated useful lives are inherently uncertain 
the three year estimated useful life of computer hardware and software is determined based on prior experience with related technology  the expected future utility of the assets to us based on our operating plans and industry standards 
hardware and software providers future support of today s technology and the future of technology in general are inherently uncertain 
these lives are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be required  such as significant technological developments  the failure of a vendor to continue to support a particular version of software or changes in operating plans 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining original term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  ranging from two to years  with the majority of the net book value invested in assets with original estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements are determined based on our prior experience with similar assets and the expected future utility of the assets to us based on our operating plans 
our future operating plans could change and we may choose to  or be required to  terminate our leases and thereby abandon our leasehold improvements prior to the termination of the associated lease or the end of the otherwise estimated useful life 
the estimated useful lives of leasehold improvements are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be required  such as a planned move to or from  or remodeling of  a leased space 
identifiable intangible assets as discussed above  the majority of the net book value of our identifiable intangible assets at december  consisted of trademarks  trade names and copyrights and customer lists  contracts and relationships 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item identifiable intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revisions to the remaining periods of amortization 
no revisions were determined to be necessary during the periods presented 
the estimated useful lives of trademarks  trade names and copyrights  ranging from two to years  are generally based on contractual or other legal terms  our plans for use of the assets and the cost and difficulty of renewing the lives of the assets 
the useful lives of these assets may change or terminate prior to their contractual lives due to changes in operating plans  brand strategy  acquisition or disposition of businesses and legal action  among other circumstances 
the estimated useful lives of customer lists  contracts and relationships  ranging from four to seven years  are determined based on our prior experience with customers in general and revenue we expect to generate through these specific customers in the future 
customers are free to terminate their relationship with us at any time  our past experience with one group of customers may not be indicative of our future experience with another group  and past revenue may not be indicative of future revenue 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments  estimates and assumptions are required in determining what positions to take on our tax returns and in calculating our provisions for income taxes  as they are based on our interpretation of tax regulations and accounting pronouncements 
we establish reserves for tax uncertainties when  despite our belief that we have appropriate support for positions we have taken on our returns  it is probable that certain of these positions will be challenged and may not be sustained upon review by taxing authorities 
these reserves are established through our income tax provisions and are included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust these reserves as governing laws and facts and circumstances change  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a specific exposure 
we have never been audited by the us internal revenue service but have been subject to continuous review by the uk inland revenue and other foreign taxing authorities 
although we believe that our judgments  estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could materially differ from our expectations 
if this should occur  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
the existence and valuation of our deferred income taxes  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and of tax loss carryforwards  are based on tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  and our interpretations thereof 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income in each applicable tax jurisdiction 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
deferred us income taxes are not provided for unremitted foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we expect those earnings will be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these investments 
our effective tax rate was   and excluding reversal of a valuation allowance for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is affected by our mix of pre tax earnings in jurisdictions with varying statutory tax rates  changes in tax laws  regulations and accounting principles  changes in valuation allowances provided against our deferred tax assets  and changes in our reserves 
during  we began transitioning a portion of our intellectual property offshore to better serve our non us customers 
although it will not impact the effective tax rate in  we anticipate that the use of our intellectual property in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates will lower our effective tax rate over the next few years 
foreign exchange foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from changes in the exchange rates underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  other than long term intercompany balances  are included in our consolidated statements of income for the periods in which the exchange rates change 
foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from changes in the exchange rates underlying intercompany balances that are of a long term investment nature  for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
the future cash needs of the parent company and each subsidiary are uncertain 
should we reclassify and settle a portion of these intercompany balances at some time in the future due to domestic cash needs or for other purposes  these intercompany balances would be redesignated as short term  and all future revaluation gains and losses would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
in addition  should we dispose of one of the subsidiaries with which we have a long term intercompany balance  the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss associated with that entity would be included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the disposal of the subsidiary

allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses as a percentage of revenue  existing economic conditions  and specific account analysis of at risk customers and delegates 
historical losses and existing economic conditions may not necessarily be indicative of future losses  and the impact of economic conditions on each of our customers is difficult to estimate 
should future uncollectible amounts not reflect our current estimates  we would be required to change our allowance for doubtful accounts through an entry to bad debt expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income

our employee stock based compensation plan provides for the issuance of stock options  restricted stock units rsus and other stock based compensation 
in connection with the adoption of this statement  we have generally shifted from issuing stock options to issuing rsus 
the fair value of rsus issued to employees is calculated as the market price of our common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of units issued 
this fair value  less estimated forfeitures  will be expensed to selling  general and administrative expenses on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the rsus 
this accounting  with the exception of the estimation of forfeitures  is the same as previously required under apb opinion no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  primarily changes in interest rates  the market price of our common stock  into which our debt is convertible equity price risk  credit ratings of issuers of our short term investments credit risk  and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate and equity price risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments for which the fair values are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows and weighted average interest rates by stated maturity dates  which may or may not be the dates on which cash is actually exchanged  as we may sell investments or convert debt prior to maturity 
fair values are determined through market quotes

therefore  we have included it

form k part ii item a in the table at its stated maturity date  however  should some or all of the holders convert  we would likely fund the required applicable principal cash repayment of up to million with existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments

the closing price of our common stock on january  was 
for our investments  the difference between the sum of the cash flows at maturity and the fair value of the investments primarily represents the impact on valuation from changes in interest rates 
the debt shown in the table above is our convertible subordinated debentures 
the difference between the cash flow at maturity and the fair value of the debentures arises primarily from changes in the market price of our common stock  into which the value of the debentures over the principal amount is convertible  and secondarily from changes in interest rates 
short term investments short term investments at december  consisted of available for sale us agency securities million  auction rate securities million  corporate bonds million  us treasury obligations million and money market funds million  carried at market value with associated unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income 
available for sale investments with contractual maturities beyond one year are classified as short term in our consolidated balance sheets because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
debt changes in interest rates have a negligible impact on the fair value of our debentures  while changes in the market price of our common stock cause the fair value of the debentures to fluctuate  sometimes significantly 
these changes are representative of changes in the value of shares of our common stock that we would have to issue to the holders of the convertible subordinated debentures if they were to tender the debentures for conversion 
in periods where the average closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for the last five trading days of a reporting period  we would be required to issue shares for the increase in the value of the debentures above their book value of million

form k part ii item a transaction gains and losses the parent company and many of our subsidiaries enter into transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency foreign currencies  primarily euros  british pounds  us dollars  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
some of these transactions result in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that are revalued each month 
upon revaluation  transaction gains and losses are generated  which  with the exception of those related to long term intercompany balances  are reported as exchange gains and losses in our consolidated statements of income in the periods in which the exchange rates fluctuate 
transaction gains and losses on foreign currency denominated long term intercompany balances for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets 
transaction gains and losses arising from revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in the same foreign currencies may offset each other  in part  acting as a natural hedge 
where our assets and liabilities are not naturally hedged  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
our forward foreign exchange contracts generally range from one to three months in original maturity and primarily require the sale of euros  british pounds  japanese yen and canadian dollars and the purchase of us dollars and british pounds 
these contracts have not been designated as hedges as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and therefore gains and losses arising from revaluation of these forward contracts are recorded as exchange gains and losses in our consolidated statements of income in the periods in which the exchange rates fluctuate 
these gains and losses generally offset  at least in part  the gains and losses of the underlying exposures that are being hedged 
based on the forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar against the exchange rates for the foreign currencies bought or sold through forward foreign currency exchange contracts would result in exchange losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar would result in gains of the same amounts 
however  these hypothetical losses or gains would be offset  at least in part  by gains or losses generated from revaluing the underlying exposures these contracts are hedging 
based on the forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical strengthening of the british pound against the exchange rates for the foreign currencies to be bought or sold through forward foreign currency exchange contracts would result in a negligible exchange gain and an exchange loss of approximately million  respectively

translation gains and losses the statements of income of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars  our reporting currency  at the prior month s average daily exchange rate 
when these exchange rates change from period to period  they cause fluctuations in reported results of operations that are not indicative of fundamental company operating performance but rather that reflect the performance of currencies 
we currently do not hedge against the impact of translation
