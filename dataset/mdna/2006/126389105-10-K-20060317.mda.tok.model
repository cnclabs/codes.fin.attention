actual results may vary from those contained in such forward looking statements 
as discussed in the note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  we have restated our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended september  and to correct certain misclassifications 
additionally  the restatement includes the restatement of certain short term investments to cash and cash equivalents at september  and the restatement had no effect on our reported operating results for any period presented 
however  the following discussion and the selected financial data above have been adjusted  where applicable  for the restated cash flow  investments and cash and cash equivalents data 
overview of fiscal results of operations the company sold substantially all of the net assets of its scanalytics subsidiary in june the assets  liabilities and operating results of scanalytics have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and cash flows and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 

table of contents scanalytics was the sole constituent of the previously reported other software segment 
the former e business segment was no longer viewed by the chief operating decision maker as a business separate from the service and systems integration business and  accordingly  it has been aggregated into that segment 
cspi operates in two segments systems  which include manufactured hardware products  service and system integration  which includes maintenance and integration and sale of third party hardware products and services and software application development  highlights include growth in revenue to million in  from million in a decrease in earnings to per diluted share in compared to per diluted share in cash used in operations of thousand  compared to cash provided by operations of million in completed the sale of the scanalytics business in june the following table sets forth certain information which is based on operations statement data percentage of sales period to period fiscal year ended september dollar increase decrease compared to compared to dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data sales costs and expenses cost of sales engineering and development selling  general and administrative restructuring total costs and expenses operating income loss other income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss for fiscal year  our primary goals were to drive sales growth from our products and services  to improve profitability  and to monitor the integration of the modcomp systems and solutions division which was purchased from technisource in results of operations compared to for the fiscal year ended september   sales increased to million  compared to million for fiscal year ended september  net income for the year ended september  was million or per share diluted compared with million or

table of contents revenue the following table details the company s sales by operating segment and geography for fiscal years september  and north america europe asia total of total systems service and systems integration total of total north america europe asia total of total systems service and systems integration total of total the company s sales by geographic area are based upon the location to which the products were shipped or services rendered 
of the million increase in revenues in compared to  million was attributable to increased product and service sales in our german subsidiary within the service and systems integration segment 
during  approximately million in revenues in germany were attributable to the relationship with the german wireless communications company  e plus 
during  e plus designated atos origin gmbh  a systems integrator in germany  as the procurement agent for e plus 
while sales to e plus through atos remained germany s largest single customer in  sales volume declined to approximately million 
this decline was more than offset by several new integration projects undertaken by our german subsidiary with other customers 
foreign exchange effects of the euro and the pound sterling against the dollar contributed to approximately  of overall increase in revenues in compared to systems sales increased approximately  in compared to the prior year 
we recognized approximately  of royalty revenue related to our contract with lockheed martin for the hawkeye e d program 
the company expects to receive approximately million in incremental royalty revenue from this contract through fiscal offsetting the increase in royalty revenue was a slight decline in product sales from our multi computer division  reflecting a reduced level of contract activity in that division 
management believes there is a reasonable potential of increased contract activity for systems products in mid

the company s overall cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased from to in compared to the cost of sales percentage of sales in the systems segment declined from to in compared to the prior year due to the effects of royalty revenues  which have no associated cost of sales  offset by decreased absorption of overhead costs of  in the third and fourth quarters of due to a reduction in product sales  write down of inventory due to obsolescence of  and the addition of a quality manager and a systems engineer of  cost of sales as a percentage of sales in the service and systems integration segment increased from in to in this increase is attributable to higher costs incurred in transactions involving the sale of third party products and to the reduction of a favorable pricing program conducted by hp in europe compared to pricing obtained in engineering and development expenses the following table details engineering and development expenses by operating segment for fiscal years ended september  and of total of total increase decrease increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands by operating segment systems service and system integration total 
table of contents engineering and development expenses increased overall by  or  in compared to the service and systems integration segment experienced a decline of approximately  in engineering expense due to reduced development efforts as engineers were re deployed on customer projects  and therefore charged to cost of sales 
the systems segment experienced a  or increase in engineering costs 
our multi computer division added two engineers to its staff during general salary increases accounted for the remainder of the increase 
selling  general and administrative the following table details selling  general and administrative expense by operating segment for fiscal years ending september  and of total of total increase increase dollar amounts in thousands by operating segment systems service and system integration total selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in compared to approximately  of the overall increase is attributable to costs associated with compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
the  increase in the service and systems integration segment was due to increased salaries and commissions expense at the deerfield beach  florida location as the sales staff was increased from to people in costs associated with the move of the corporate offices of modcomp in florida to deerfield beach also contributed to the increase over offsetting the increase in selling and marketing costs in florida was a decrease in sales and marketing costs in the uk due primarily to the retirement of the general manager 
increased costs associated with the uk pension and audit fees increased uk general and administrative costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in the systems division increased  due primarily to increased costs associated the additions to the finance group staffing  increased directors fees  and higher directors and officer s insurance premiums 
other income expenses the following table details other income expenses for fiscal years ended september  and of total of total increase decrease increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands dividend income interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss other income expense  net total other income  net 
table of contents increases in interest expense and interest income are due to the general rise in interest rates during compared to the foreign currency loss in reflects the general decline of the euro and the pound sterling with respect to the us dollar in compared to income taxes the company recorded a provision for income tax expense of  for fiscal year compared to tax expense of  for fiscal year the tax expense in fiscal year and is primarily due to the income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
in fiscal year  we began to record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in the us and the uk 
our us tax expense for fiscal years and has been reduced by decreasing our valuation allowance  thus reducing the us tax expense to the company  to reflect the portion of fully reserved net operating losses that we were able to use during these years 
results of operations compared to for the fiscal year ended september   sales increased to million  compared to million for fiscal year ended september  net income for the year ended september  was million or per share diluted compared with a net loss of million or per share diluted for fiscal year ended september  revenue the following table details the company s sales by operating segment for fiscal years september  and the company s sales by geographic area based on the location to which the products were shipped or services rendered are as follows north america europe asia total of total systems service and systems integration total of total north america europe asia total of total systems service and systems integration total of total the increase in consolidated revenue during the fiscal year ended september   as compared to the prior year  was primarily due to a full year of sales from the acquisition of technisource and growth in the european sales for the service and systems integration and increased systems sales for the advanced e c hawkeye contract 
the technisource acquisition accounted for of the total increase in sales 
we purchased technisource on may  so there were only four months of technisource revenue reflected in fiscal year the increase in european sales represented of the total increase for the year 
european sales increases were primarily due to the additional sales of our german operations  which accounted for of the increased sales 
the increased sales were due to additional product and service sales to our largest customer e plus  a 
table of contents wireless communications company in germany  additional business in the integration and security area  and the benefit from the foreign exchange rate with approximately a increase in the euro to the us dollar 
our systems sales increased by million or  due primarily to the advanced e c hawkeye aircraft contract with lockheed martin  which represented of the total systems sales for the year 
on september  we were awarded a contract with lockheed martin to provide advanced series multicomputer products and technology for use in the next generation radar in the us navy s advanced e c hawkeye aircraft 
the system development and demonstration sd d contract value is approximately million 
lockheed martin will license technology from the company for a ruggedized version of the cspi series product 
the e c hawkeye is slated to replace the current an aps airborne radar system by in the sd d phase lockheed martin is scheduled to produce five radar systems for qualification  testing and reliability checking by the navy and we fulfilled most of the deliverables requirements under the contract as of september  a full scale production program to outfit all aircraft in the e c fleet by is possible according to lockheed martin 
north american sales increases were also attributable to the technisource acquisition 
this acquired division sells primarily in the us and accounted for million of total sales for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
in addition  sales of the systems segment increased approximately million due to the sales to lockheed martin for the advance e c hawkeye 
sales of the systems segment are primarily made in the us and japan 
the company expects that the trend toward increased north american sales will continue in the future  but with nominal increases 
this will change from our historic results  where previously more than of the revenue of the company had come from international markets 
european sales increased million or 
this increase was primarily from our subsidiaries in germany 
sales in asia increased million which was primarily for systems sales for defense based projects in japan

the improvement was due to the increased sales in the systems segment  which improved our overall manufacturing efficiencies with the increased volume 
there was also a decrease in the cost of sales for service and systems integration  due in part to price benefits from manufacturers such as hp in europe  and increased service revenue  which has a lower cost of sales 
engineering and development expenses the following table details engineering and development expenses by operating segment for fiscal years ended september  and of total of total increase decrease increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands by operating segment systems service and system integration total engineering and development expense decreases were due primarily to the reduction and redeployment of staff in the service and system integration segment made in the prior fiscal years 
we had staff reductions of employees last fiscal year in the service and system integration and we also re deployed personnel from development activities to assist in expanding our services activities to enhance our revenue 
the related expenses were accordingly shifted to cost of sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative the following table details selling  general and administrative expense by operating segment for fiscal years ended september  and of total of total increase increase dollar amounts in thousands by operating segment systems service and system integration total selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million due to the technisource acquisition  executive bonuses  increased audit and other expenses related to new regulatory requirements created by the sarbanes oxley legislation  all of which was offset by some of the benefits of the cost cutting and containment programs 
the technisource acquisition accounted for million of the increased expenses 
the company exceeded its projections for the fiscal year in both sales and profitability  which increased the executive bonuses that are based on meeting the financial goals of the company 
if the company exceeds the goals  the bonus calculation increases 
the increased bonus expense represented of the total increase 
the company had a significant increase in the cost of meeting the requirements of the new regulations with our auditors  lawyers  outside consultants and advisors 
the increase represented of the increased expenses 
other income expenses the following table details other income expenses for fiscal years ended september  and of total of total increase decrease increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands dividend income interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain other income loss  net total other income  net the decline in foreign exchange gain was due to the fact that one of the company s foreign subsidiaries converted a portion of a loan to another foreign subsidiary to capital in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  management had originally intended to repay the loans but has changed its intention for future settlement of the remaining loan obligation to be of a long term nature 
as a result of the change in intention to settle these loans  the recording of the exchange gain or loss on the loans will now be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
income taxes the company recorded a provision for income tax expense of  for fiscal year compared to a tax benefit of  for fiscal year the tax expense in fiscal year is primarily due to the income generated by our foreign subsidiary in germany 
in fiscal year  we began to record a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in the us our us tax expense for fiscal year has been reduced by decreasing our valuation allowance  thus reducing the us tax expense to the company  to reflect the portion of fully reserved net operating losses that we were able to use during this year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity  after consideration of cash from operations  is our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  which decreased by  to million as of september   as compared to million as of september  at september  our investments consisted of corporate bonds and us government and state securities 
the primary objective of our investment policy is the preservation of capital 
investments are limited to high quality corporate debt  government securities  municipal debt securities  money market securities  funds and similar instruments 
in fiscal year  the company used approximately  of cash in operations  compared to generating million in fiscal year the decrease in cash generated from operations was primarily due the decrease in net income of  to  compared to million in fiscal  the decrease in accounts payable and accruals offset by the decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in taxes payable and an increase in deferred compensation and retirement plan obligations 
the decrease in payables was driven by the pay down of executive bonuses and the timing of inventory and other purchases 
our strategy is to a maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents in our subsidiaries for operating purposes and to invest the remaining amount of cash in interest bearing and marketable securities 
the company utilized approximately  in investing activities during fiscal year during fiscal year  approximately  in cash was used for the net purchases of investments 
in approximately million in cash was generated by net maturities and sales of investments 
the company purchased and million of property and equipment during fiscal and  respectively 
in june  we sold the operating assets and liabilities of scanalytics for net proceeds of approximately  we have  accordingly  classified the scanalytics business as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
for the year ended september   the discontinued operations of scanalytics consumed thousand of cash in operating activities 
during the year scanalytics expended thousand to purchase property  equipment  and improvements 
we do not expect there to be any further sources or uses of cash related to scanalytics after fiscal in fiscal year the company acquired technisource for approximately million in cash 
during  the company s investing activities consisted of sales and maturities and purchases of marketable securities resulting in net proceeds of million and million used for purchases of computers  furniture and equipment 
the company generated approximately   and  in cash from financing activities during fiscal years   and  respectively from proceeds of shares sold through the employee stock purchase and exercise of stock options 
purchases of treasury stock totaled  in and  in the company has estimated future benefit payment obligations of million related to plans in germany  the uk  and the uk the company expects to contribute million to the plans in if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  we may need to access funds through bank loans  sale of securities or other means 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to complete development or enhancement of products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to effectively operate our business 
the following is a schedule of the company s contractual obligations at september  total one year or less years years thereafter amounts in thousands operating leases retirement obligations 
table of contents based on our current plans and business conditions  management believes that the company s available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations and investments will be sufficient to provide for the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventory valuation  goodwill  income taxes  deferred compensation and retirement plans  restructuring costs and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and net deferred tax asset valuation allowance  inventory valuation  goodwill impairment  and pension and retirement plans 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from the sale of it solutions  third party products  network management and storage systems integration services and high performance cluster computer systems 
cspi recognizes revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
specifically  we follow the requirements of sab and eitf the manner in which we apply these standards to our revenues recognition is as follows systems revenue revenue from the sale of hardware products is recognized at the time of shipment and when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company also offers training  maintenance agreements and support services 
the company has established fair value on its training  maintenance and support services based on separate sales of these elements at prices stated in our standard price lists 
these prices are not discounted 
revenue from service obligations under maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which is typically three to twelve months  if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
support services provided on a time and material basis are recognized as provided if all of the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element and the support services have been provided 
revenue on training is recognized when the training is completed 
during fiscal  the company began to recognize royalty revenues related to the production and sale of certain of the company s proprietary system technology by a third party 
the company recognizes royalty revenues upon notification of shipment of the systems produced pursuant to the royalty agreement 
this is the point as defined in the contract that payment of the royalty is committed and the company has no further performance obligations and hence the earnings process is complete 
service and system integration revenue our service and systems integration segment includes the re sale of third party hardware and third party software  which may be bundled with extended third party warranty  installation  training and support services 

table of contents the third party warranty is solely serviced by our vendors and we do not have any service obligations under these warranties 
under the support services agreements  we provide services to identify which component in the system is causing a malfunction  however  once the malfunctioning component is isolated  the customer must deal directly with the third party vendor for remediation 
the support services are always priced using a standard calculation based on estimated calls and are based on separate sales of the services as stated in our price lists 
this price is not discounted and renewals are only adjusted for standard price index increases 
as a result  we believe that we have established fair market value for this element 
after persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the company recognizes revenue on all elements  except for the support services  when all the products have been shipped and services included in these elements have been performed  customer acceptance has been ascertained  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue for the support services is recognized over the term of the contract  typically three to twelve months 
service and systems integration also has some customized integration revenue  which may include revenue from the sale of third party hardware  licensed software either proprietary or third party  consulting integration services  maintenance support  and service support 
maintenance support agreements represent fixed fee support agreements on our delivered integration systems  while the service agreements represent time and material billings for services on an as needed basis 
these services do not provide for upgrades unless the upgrade is required to fix a functionality issue ie  bug fix 
for software licenses sold separately without modification and training  revenue is recognized upon delivery 
revenue derived from consulting services rendered in connection with the integration of third party hardware and third party software is generally recognized when the services have been completed 
valuation allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance for the entire balance of deferred tax assets in the us and us as it is more likely than not they will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income in making this assessment 
based on the lack of income in the us and us over the several years and lack of significant orders  we established a valuation allowance for the entire deferred tax asset 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for the future taxable income over the period in which the deferred taxes will reverse or nols expire  management believes it is more likely than not  that the company will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider and rely upon projections of future income 
the key assumptions in our projections include sales growth rates  including potential contract wins  and expected levels of operating expenditures in addition to factors discussed in the section factors that may affect future performance 
these assumptions are subject to variation based upon both internal and external factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
to the extent that actual experience deviates from our assumptions  our projections would be affected and hence our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax asset may change 

table of contents inventory valuation the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventories held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill impairment we follow the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and test for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important that could indicate impairment include significant under performance relative to prior operating results  change in projections  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
at september  we had million in goodwill  which relates to the business acquired from technisource in we had no impairment charge during the years ended september    or in evaluating the impairment of goodwill  we consider a number of analyses such as discounted cash flow projections and market capitalization value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating fair value of the businesses with goodwill for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in addition  we make certain judgments about assets such as accounts receivable and inventory to the estimated balance sheet for those business 
we also consider our market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
our key assumptions include sales growth and expected levels of operating expenditures  which are subject to variation based on both internal and external factors 
to the extent that actual experience deviates from the projections  our assessment regarding impairment may change 
such a change could have a material adverse affect on the statement of operations 
goodwill is tested at the lowest level within the consolidated group for which identifiable cash flows that are largely independent on the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for testing conducted at september   the testing was conducted at the level of the division within modcomp which comprises the business acquired from technisource in pension and retirement plans in the united kingdom and germany  the company provides defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for the majority of the employees 
pension expense is based on actuarial computation of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets  expected compensation increases and applicable discount rates 
the company estimates return on assets using historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plans  adjusted for the current economic environment 
a decrease in the expected return on pension assets would increase pension expense 
expected compensation increases are estimated based on historical and expected increases in the future 
increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense 
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality debt securities currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense and projected benefit obligation while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense and projected benefit obligation 
in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
employee accounting for pensions  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if outside a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the company s plan in germany is unfunded and complies with all german government requirements 
in estimating the pension expense and projected benefit obligation  we utilized a compensation rate of increase of 
table of contents 
the company calculated an assumed discount rate of at september  considering the timing of expected future cash benefit payments 
in formulating this assumption  the company utilized year euro treasury bonds adjusted to add 
for aa rated euro corporate bond premiums 
each participant in the plan has an individual contract with the company governed by german law 
the plan is funded through operations and the estimated total obligation of the plan is million at september  the estimated obligation of the plan is the excess of the projected benefit obligation  or pbo  over the fair value of the pension plan assets at the end of the period 
the company recorded a minimum pension liability of  at september  this amount represents the amount by which accumulated benefit obligations exceed the accrued amounts previously recorded 
in the united kingdom  benefits accruing to participants were frozen on april  accordingly active employees ceased to accrue benefits under the plan as of that date 
the plan is partially funded with investments of million at september  the assets are invested in equity securities and bonds which are managed by a third party trustee 
the company calculated an assumed discount rate of at september  considering the timing of expected future cash benefit payments 
in formulating this assumption  the company utilized the uk government year medium coupon bond rate plus  adjusted for corporate bond premiums 
the expected return on assets analysis prepared by the company reflected expected return on plan assets assumptions in and of and  respectively 
the company had contributed approximately  each year for each of the last two years and will continue to contribute to the plan based on the uk statutory minimum pension funding requirements 
the unfunded projected benefit obligation is million at september  the company has a minimum pension liability of million at september  this amount represents the amount by which accumulated benefit obligations exceed the accrued amounts previously recorded 
in the us  the company also provides benefits through supplementary retirement plans to certain employees and former employees who are now retired 
the plan liabilities were estimated at september  using a discount rate assumption of based on current long term investments rates 
management estimates the discount rates based upon the timing of expected future cash benefit payments and the interest rate indices of moodys and citi group to arrive at the current discount rate assumption 
the estimated projected benefit obligation for these plans is million 
the company has recorded a minimum pension liability of  at september  the company also provides for officer death benefits through post retirement plans to certain officers 
the discount rate used to estimate these plan liabilities is which was estimated in the same manner as the as the supplemental plan obligation discount rate 
the plans do not have any minimum funding requirements and the company plans to fund the obligation through life insurance contracts 
the company expects to receive a refund of all insurance premiums paid under the plan in the future equal to the cash surrender value and a portion  if necessary  of death benefits to be paid upon the death of the participant
