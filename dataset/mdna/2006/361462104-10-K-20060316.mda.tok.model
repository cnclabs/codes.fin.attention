item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reviews our results of operations and assesses our financial condition 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in this report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this report for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
historical results of operations and any trends which may appear are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future years 
executive summary gb t bancshares  inc  headquartered in gainesville  georgia  consists of a network of community banks in growth areas of georgia with approximately billion in total consolidated assets as of december  we believe that maintaining autonomy within our subsidiary banks serves the unique needs of each community we serve 
we focus on strong asset quality and sound management teams and use economies of scale to enhance our profitability 
our results reflect a combination of internal and acquisition growth 
prior to  we had completed six acquisitions 
on march   we completed the acquisition of fnbg bancshares  inc and its banking subsidiary first national bank of gwinnett 
we continue to build infrastructure to support our growth 
as a bank holding company  our results of operations are almost entirely dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary banks 
the following table sets forth our subsidiary banks and selected data related to each bank as of december  bank number of branches market area counties total assets at december  in thousands gainesville bank trust with divisions lumpkin county bank  southern heritage bank and bank of athens hall  lumpkin  clarke united bank trust polk  bartow community trust bank paulding  cobb hometown bank of villa rica carroll  paulding first national bank of the south baldwin  putnam first national bank of gwinnett gwinnett like most community banks  we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments 
our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
approximately of our total deposits are interest bearing 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which is called our net interest spread 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our clients 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income  as well as of our noninterest expense 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
we measure and monitor the following factors as key indicators of our financial performance net income earnings per share loan and deposit growth credit quality financial performance for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  net income of million  up from million diluted earnings per share of compared to net interest margin of compared to loan growth of million or excluding acquisition of fnbg deposit growth of million or excluding acquisition of fnbg return on average assets of compared to return on average equity of compared to nonperfoming assets ratio of compared to net charge off ratio of compared to effect of economic trends during the three years ended december   our rates on both short term or variable rate interest earning assets and short term or variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined primarily as a result of the actions taken by the federal reserve  however during  both these rates increased 
during most of and during  the united states experienced an economic decline 
during this period  the economy was affected by lower returns of the stock markets 
economic data led the federal reserve to begin an aggressive program of reducing rates that moved the federal funds rate down times during for a total reduction of basis points 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate down an additional basis points  bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in years 
despite sharply lower short term rates  stimulus to the economy during was muted and consumer demand and business investment activity remained weak 
during all of and substantially all of  the financial markets operated under historically low interest rates 
as a result of these unusual conditions  congress passed an economic stimulus plan in during  many economists believed the economy began to show signs of strengthening  and the federal reserve increased the short term interest rate by basis points during the second  third and fourth quarters of and by basis points during in  as of the date of this report  the federal reserve had raised the short term interest rate by basis points 
many economists believe that the federal reserve will continue to increase rates during no assurance can be given that the federal reserve will actually continue to raise interest rates or that the results we anticipate will actually occur 
the specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio  especially the real estate portfolio  include  but are not limited to  a general downturn in the economy which could affect unemployment rates in our market areas  general real estate market deterioration  interest rate fluctuations  deteriorated collateral  title defects  inaccurate appraisals  and financial deterioration of borrowers 
construction and development lending can also present other specific risks to the lender such as whether developers can find builders to buy lots for home construction  whether the builders can obtain financing for the construction  whether the builders can sell the home to a buyer  and whether the buyer can obtain permanent financing 
currently  real estate values and employment trends in our market areas have remained stable 
the general economy and loan demand declined slightly during and continued to decline throughout in  the economy began to show signs of improvement which continued through and our growth has not been significantly impacted by the previously mentioned economic conditions 
critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of december  included in this report 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe that our determination of the allowance for loan losses is our most significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the calculation is an estimate of the amount of loss in the loan portfolios of our subsidiary banks 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses  and may require us to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
we use an point rating system for our loans 
ratings of to are considered pass ratings  is pass watch  is special mention  is substandard  is doubtful  and is loss 
the originating officer rates all loans on this system 
this rating is adjusted from time to time by the officer to accurately reflect the loan s current status 
these ratings are reviewed for accuracy regularly by the loan committee of the respective bank subsidiary  an outside independent loan review firm  internal auditors  and by the applicable regulator 
the general allowance consists of pass loans 
pass loans are separated into homogeneous pools 
currently  these pools consist of real estate  commercial  consumer and credit card loans 
management assigns loss percentages to these categories of homogeneous pools of loans based on the greater of historic loss data in each category or the minimum risk percentage for this category 
management tracks the last eight quarters moving average net losses for the historic loss percentage in each category 
this historic loss percentage is reviewed and adjusted periodically  by pool  in light of current trends in past dues  changes in lending policies  underwriting standards  economic conditions  and other factors that may affect this number 
in addition to the homogeneous pools  management has specified certain industry risks and applied loss percentages to the specified industry risk categories 
recently  because of low losses in most categories  management has assigned minimum percentages to each category 
these minimums are reviewed and may be adjusted from time to time to reflect current economic conditions  changes in lending practices  underwriting standards and other matters that may be necessary 
those minimums are indicated on our loan loss reserve adequacy calculation 
for loans rated pass watch  a loss percentage of is used 
the specific allowance consists of loans that are classified as either  doubtful  substandard or special mention 
all impaired or significant loans rated  and are individually analyzed and a specific reserve assigned 
management  considering current information and events regarding a borrowers ability to repay its obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
the majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent 
the allowance for loan losses on these loans is determined based upon fair value estimates net of selling costs of the respective collateral 
the actual losses on these loans could differ significantly if the fair value of the collateral is different from the estimates used in determining the allocated allowance 
most of our collateral dependent impaired loans are secured by real estate 
the fair value of these real estate properties is generally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser 
management also considers other factors or recent developments which could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals 
for loans rated  a loss percentage of is used 
all significant loans rated and are individually analyzed and a specific reserve is assigned based on exposure or industry standards  whichever is greater 
these loans  their reserves  and action plans to resolve their criticisms are reviewed monthly by the loan committee of each subsidiary bank 
all other loans rated and are assigned loss percentages of and respectively 
all loans rated are assigned a specific reserve of 
the remainder of the balance in the reserve for loan losses is unallocated 
management believes that the unallocated allowance is adequate to provide for probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio and that have not been fully provided for through the allocated and general allowance 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the unallocated allowance include the economic environment  experience level of lenders  concentration in commercial and consumer real estate loans  size of individual loans and the continued strong loan growth in our markets 
these factors are tempered by lending practices related to the real estate portfolio  the continuing positive performance within this segment of our loan portfolio  the knowledge and experience of our commercial lending staff  and the relationship banking philosophy maintained in our community banks 
goodwill 
our growth over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions 
prior to july  all of our acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interests business combination method of accounting 
effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which allows only the use of the purchase method of accounting 
for purchase acquisitions  we are required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
in july  the required impairment testing of goodwill was performed and no impairment existed as of the valuation date  as the fair value of our net assets exceeded their carrying value 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income 
effect of recent business acquisitions on december   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire mountain bancshares  inc  the parent company of the million asset mountain state bank which is headquartered in dawsonville  georgia 
under the terms of the agreement  mountain bancshares shareholders will receive shares of our common stock and per share  or approximately million in cash  in exchange for each share of mountain bancshares common stock 
the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of  pending shareholder and regulatory approvals 
accordingly  the results of operations included in this report do not include the results of operations of mountain bancshares

financial condition total assets 
our total assets increased million or for the year ended december  compared to million or for the same period in the increase in consists primarily of an increase in total loans of million or  and an increase in goodwill and intangible assets of million 
excluding the acquisition of fnbg bancshares  inc  total assets increased million  or  during also  excluding the acquisition  total loans increased million 
for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december   the acquisitions of southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank accounted for approximately million of the increase in total assets 
the overall growth in and is consistent with management s plans 
the competition for deposits plays an important role in our overall growth 
total loans 
our primary focus is to maximize earnings through lending activities 
any excess funds are invested according to our investment policy 
total loans increased or million for the year ended december  exclusive of the acquisition of fnbg bancshares  inc  which represented million of this increase  total loans increased million or 
this increase is compared to an increase of million or during exclusive of the acquisitions of southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank  which represented million of the increase in  total loans increased million or 
as of december  and  our loan to deposit ratio remained constant at for both years 
at december  and  we had total outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively 
these funds have been used to fund loan growth 
the utilization of borrowings to fund loan growth enables us to maintain a higher loan to deposit ratio and maintain an adequate liquidity ratio 
our loan to funds ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
total deposits 
during  total deposits grew by million  or 
exclusive of the acquisition of fnbg bancshares  inc  which accounted for million of this increase  total deposits grew million or during compared to an increase of million or in  exclusive of the acquisitions of southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank 
results of operations for the years ended december   and net interest income and earning assets 
during and  we continued to experience moderate internal growth in interest earning and total assets which was funded by increases in deposits  borrowings  the retention of net profits and proceeds from a stock offering 
during  we experienced additional growth through the acquisition of fnbg bancshares  inc and in through the acquisitions of southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank as explained above 
we recorded net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our profitability is determined by our ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and security losses  to generate noninterest income  and to control operating expenses 
because interest rates are determined by market forces and economic conditions beyond our control  our ability to generate net interest income depends upon our ability to obtain an adequate net interest spread between the rate earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net yield on average interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to increases in interest rates by the federal reserve in in addition to increased loan volume 
in  the average yield on interest earning assets increased to from in and the average yield on interest bearing liabilities increased to in from in the overall change in the interest rate spread from to was a decrease of basis points 
the decrease in the net interest spread is a result of increases in time deposit volume at an average rate basis points above the average in and increases in interest bearing demand and savings volume at an average rate basis points above the average  partially offset by increases in loan volume at an average rate basis points above the average in total average interest earning assets increased by million  to  million at december  as compared to and average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  to  million for the same period 
we continue to experience growth in our portfolios while maintaining our competitive pricing 
the net yield on average interest earning assets decreased by basis points to from for the year ended december  as compared to the decreased net yield in was primarily attributable to increases in loan volume at lower interest rates 
net interest income increased by million to million in  compared to an increase of million in the increase for both years continues to reflect the continued increase in interest earning assets during and the change in net interest income is primarily the result of the increases in net volume versus changes in net interest rates 
these variances include the impact of the acquisition of fnbg bancshares in and the acquisitions of southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank in other income 
other income decreased during by  compared to an increase of million in for the year ended december   service charges on deposit accounts increased by  and mortgage origination fees increased by  which was offset by a decrease in other service charges and fees of  the decrease in other service charges and fees can be attributed to the loss of insurance commissions due to the sale of clc and the loss of processing fees due to an expired contract 
for the year ended december   service charges on deposit accounts increased million  other service charges and fees increased by  security transactions  net increased by  and we recorded a gain on the sale of property at the operations center of  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage origination fees of  the increases in service charges are directly related to the increase in deposit accounts and the inclusion of fnbg bancshares  inc for part of  and southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank for part of ended other expense 
other expense increased million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in salaries and employee benefits represent the most significant portions of these increases  which increased by million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased by employees in march due to the acquisition of fnbg bancshares  inc  however the number decreased by when community loan company was sold on october  in addition to the additional salary expense related to new employees for eight months of  we incurred increases due to increases in profit sharing contributions  health insurance costs  incentive compensation  certain severance payments and normal salary increases for the years ended december  and other operating expenses increased by million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increase in other operating expenses in included increases in supplies  postage and telephone expense of  loan acquisition costs of  legal and collection expenses of  and a loss of  recorded in the fourth quarter of on the sale of community loan company 
the increases in all of the above categories can be partially attributed to the inclusion of fnbg bancshares  inc for the year ended december   since the acquisition date of march  income tax expense 
income tax expense increased by million to million in from million in the increase in was attributable to increased profits 
the effective tax rate for year ended december  was  compared to for net income 
net income increased by million or for the year ended december  when compared to the increase in net income for the year ended december  was million or when compared to these increases are directly related to the increase in net interest income and the inclusion of first national bank of the gwinnett in  and southern heritage bank and lumpkin county bank in  which are partially offset by the increases in other expenses as discussed above and the additional loan loss provision taken in  as discussed below 
asset quality 
provision for loan losses was million during  compared to million in this increase was due primarily to an additional provision of million taken in the second quarter of at htb due to the further impairment of an inherited single loan relationship prior to the company s acquisition of htb 
the additional increase in the provision was due to loan growth 
the provision for loan losses is the charge to operations which management believes is necessary to fund the allowance for loan losses 
this provision is based on management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
our evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses  and may require us to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
loans acquired in business acquisitions were acquired at their estimated fair value  including an adequate allowance for loan losses 
see also our discussion of the loan loss allowance in the critical accounting policies section included in this report 
the following table presents details of the provision for loan losses  nonaccrual loans and related categories for each subsidiary as well as on a consolidated basis 
the decrease in nonaccrual loans is related to five loans at htb totaling million representing one loan relationship  of which million was moved to other real estate and million was charged off 
as shown in the summary of loan loss experience  the consumer related charge offs consist of many smaller balance loans while the real estate related charge offs consist of only a few larger balance loans 
real estate loans are normally secured by one to four family residences or other real estate with values exceeding the original loan balance  therefore minimizing the risk of loss 
however in the current year  real estate charge offs were increased significantly due to the one time million charge off discussed above 
consumer loans  however  may be secured by consumer goods and automobiles  or may be unsecured  and therefore subject to greater loss in the event of charge off 
during a recession  losses are more likely and the risk of loss is greater in the consumer portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans at december  was  which was up from at december  this increase is due to nonaccrual loans decreasing to million at december  from million at december  as well as the increase in the provision for loan losses in to million compared to million for during  other problem loans  including past due loans greater than days past due  decreased by  compared to a decrease of  in based on management s evaluations  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb potential losses on existing loans 
years ended december  dollars in thousands total charge offs total recoveries net charge offs recoveries total nonaccrual loans loans past due days other real estate provision for loan losses allowance total loans net charge offs recoveries average loans allowance nonperforming loans effects of inflation the impact of inflation on banks differs from its impact on non financial institutions 
banks  as financial intermediaries  have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to fluctuate in concert with inflation 
a bank can reduce the impact of inflation if it can manage its interest rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
through the investment committee of our holding company s board of directors  we attempt to structure the assets and liabilities and manage the rate sensitivity gap of each subsidiary bank  thereby seeking to minimize the potential effects of inflation 
for information on the management of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  see asset liability management below 
off balance sheet arrangements our financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments 
such financial instruments are included in the financial statements when funds are distributed or the instruments become payable 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and credit card commitments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making such commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
although these amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  a summary of our commitments as of december  and december  are as follows december  december  dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit financial standby letters of credit other standby letters of credit credit card commitments total liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and the ability to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments  monthly amortizing loans  maturing single payment loans  and maturities of securities and prepayments 
also  we maintain relationships with correspondent banks which could provide funds on short notice 
as of december   we had amounts borrowed under federal funds purchase lines and securities sold under repurchase agreements of million compared to million as of december  these borrowings typically mature within one to four business days 
in november  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock in a secondary stock offering receiving net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes 
the following table sets forth certain information about contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due after december  total year or less years years after years dollars in thousands subordinated debt operating leases federal home loan bank advances total contractual cash obligations our operating leases represent short term obligations  normally with maturities of one year or less  with the exception of one lease entered into in which has a maturity of years 
many of the operating leases have thirty day cancellation provisions 
our liquidity and capital resources are monitored on a periodic basis by management and state and federal regulatory authorities 
at december   our liquidity ratio was 
liquidity is measured by the ratio of net cash  federal funds sold and securities to net deposits and short term liabilities 
in the event our subsidiary banks need to generate additional liquidity  funding plans would be implemented as outlined in the liquidity policy of the banks 
our banks have lines of credit available to meet any unforeseen liquidity needs 
also  our banks have relationships with the federal home loan bank of atlanta  which provides funding for loan growth on an as needed basis 
management reviews liquidity on a periodic basis to monitor and adjust liquidity as necessary 
management has the ability to adjust liquidity by selling securities available for sale  selling participations in loans and accessing available funds through various borrowing arrangements 
at december   we had available borrowing capacity totaling approximately million through various borrowing arrangements and available lines of credit 
we believe our short term investments and available borrowing arrangements are adequate to cover any reasonably anticipated immediate need for funds 
as of december   gb t bancshares  inc and its subsidiary banks were considered to be well capitalized as defined in the fdicia and based on regulatory minimum capital requirements

the branch is expected to be complete in the second quarter of with an approximate cost of million 
management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties  other than those discussed above  that will have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
management is also not aware of any current recommendations by the regulatory authorities which  if they were implemented  would have such an effect 
our subsidiary banks are subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be declared without prior regulatory approval 
at december   approximately million of retained earnings at our subsidiary banks were available for dividend declaration without regulatory approval

yields on nontaxable securities are not presented on a tax equivalent basis 
rate and volume analysis the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and expense during the years indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to change in volume change in volume multiplied by old rate  change in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume  and a combination of change in rate and change in volume 
the changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the objective of this policy is to monitor interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities so as to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on earnings 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we also evaluate how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit the amount of changes in interest rates 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates 
changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position 
we currently price deposits in response to market rates and it is management s intention to continue this policy 
if deposits are not priced in response to market rates  a loss of deposits could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position 
at december  our cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap ratio was 
this indicates that our interest bearing assets will reprice during this period at a rate faster than our interest earning liabilities 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates 
within three months after three months but within one year after one year but within five years after five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits federal funds sold securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand and savings time deposits federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio does not include restricted equity securities  which consist of federal home loan bank of atlanta stock and the bankers bank stock  as such assets are not interest rate sensitive 
management believes that gap analysis is a useful tool for measuring interest rate risk only when used in conjunction with its simulation model 
as of december   the company maintained an asset sensitive interest rate risk position based on its simulation model results 
this positioning would be expected to result in an increase in net interest income in a rising rate environment and a decrease in net interest income in a declining rate environment 
this is generally due to a greater proportion of interest earning assets repricing on a variable rate basis as compared to variable rate funding sources 
this asset sensitivity is indicated by selected results of net interest income simulations 
the actual realized change in net interest income would depend on several factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  actual realized growth in asset and liability volumes  as well as the mix experienced over these time horizons 
market conditions and their resulting impact on loan  deposit  and funding pricing would also be a primary determinant in the realized level of net interest income 
the table below shows the impact on net interest margins over a twelve month period when subjected to an immediate basis point increase and decrease in rate 
twelve month net interest income sensitivity change in short term interest rates in basis points estimated change in net interest income flat we actively manage the mix of asset and liability maturities to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income 
except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on us due to the rate variability and short term maturities of our earning assets 
in particular  as of december  approximately of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans which have variable rate terms or mature within one year

this status is determined when there is a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower and full repayment of principal and interest is not expected  and the principal or interest is more than days past due  unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
accrual of interest on such loans is resumed when  in management s judgment  the collection of interest and principal becomes probable 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been included in the table above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources 
these classified loans do not represent material credits about which management is aware and which cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
in the event of non performance by the borrower  these loans have collateral pledged which would prevent the recognition of substantial losses

loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collection of principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a formal analysis which assesses the risk within the loan portfolio 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the subsidiary banks allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require our subsidiary banks to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

borrowings as part of our operating strategy  we have utilized federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements as an alternative to retail deposits to fund our operations when borrowings are less costly and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread or when we need additional funds to satisfy loan demand 
by utilizing federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  which possess varying stated maturities  we can meet our liquidity needs without otherwise being dependent upon retail deposits and revising our deposit rates to attract retail deposits  which  other than certificates of deposit  have no stated maturities and are subject to withdrawal from us at any time 
at december   we had million in outstanding federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements
