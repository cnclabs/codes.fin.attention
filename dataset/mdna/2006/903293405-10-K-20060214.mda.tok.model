item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview usg corporation the corporation and of its united states subsidiaries collectively  the debtors are currently operating under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code 
the debtors took this action to resolve asbestos claims in a fair and equitable manner  to protect the long term value of the debtors businesses  and to maintain the debtors leadership positions in their markets 
in late january  the debtors  the committee representing asbestos personal injury claimants the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants or acc  and the legal representative for future asbestos personal injury claimants the futures representative reached an agreement to resolve debtors present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities and to cooperate in the confirmation of a plan of reorganization consistent with that resolution the asbestos agreement 
the asbestos agreement was approved by usg s board of directors on january   and was executed by the futures representative and each law firm representing a member of the acc 
the asbestos agreement also is supported by the committee representing unsecured creditors the official committee of unsecured creditors and the committee representing the corporation s shareholders the official committee of equity security holders 
the asbestos agreement does not include asbestos property damage claims  and the committee representing asbestos property damage claimants the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants has not taken a position on the asbestos agreement 
as contemplated by the asbestos agreement  the debtors expect to file a proposed plan of reorganization the proposed plan and disclosure statement with the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court in february incorporating the terms of the asbestos agreement and addressing the treatment of all other claims and interests 
pursuant to the proposed plan  a trust would be created and funded by debtors pursuant to section g of the bankruptcy code  and this trust would compensate all qualifying present and future asbestos personal injury claims against debtors 
if confirmed by the courts  the proposed plan would contain an injunction channeling all asbestos personal injury claims against the debtors to the section g trust for payment and precluding any individual or entity from bringing an asbestos personal injury claim against debtors 
this channeling injunction would include any asbestos personal injury claims against debtors relating to ap green refractories co 
ap green  a former subsidiary of us gypsum and the corporation 
the amount that the debtors would be required to pay to the section g asbestos personal injury trust would depend upon whether national legislation creating a trust for payment of asbestos personal injury claims is enacted by the th day after final adjournment of the th congress 
if the proposed plan is confirmed and the legislation is enacted by that date  the debtors funding obligation to the section g trust would be million 
if the proposed plan is confirmed and such legislation is not enacted before that date or is enacted but held unconstitutional  the debtors funding obligation to the section g trust would total billion 
under the proposed plan  allowed claims of all other creditors  including allowed claims of general unsecured creditors  would be paid in full  with interest where required 
disputed claims  including disputed asbestos property damage claims  would be resolved in the bankruptcy proceedings or other forum  where appropriate 
upon resolution of those disputed claims  the allowed amount of any such claims would also be paid in full  with interest where required 
shareholders of the corporation as of the effective date of the proposed plan would retain their shares  and pursuant to a proposed shareholder rights offering  would have the right to purchase  at per share  one new common share of the corporation for each share owned as of the effective date of the rights offering 
there are important conditions to the asbestos agreement and conditions to confirmation and effectiveness of the proposed plan 
one of the conditions of the asbestos agreement is that the proposed plan must be confirmed and have an effective date on or before august   absent written agreement among all parties to the asbestos agreement to extend that time 
there can be no assurance that the proposed plan will be confirmed or  if confirmed  become effective by august  additional information about the proposed plan  the section g asbestos personal injury trust contemplated by the proposed plan  funding relating to the proposed plan  and conditions and other factors relating to the effectiveness of the proposed plan is set forth in voluntary reorganization under chapter  below 
the corporation had billion of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities as of december  management believes that this liquidity plus expected operating cash flows and available sources of outside financing will meet the corporation s cash needs  including making regular capital investments to maintain and enhance its businesses  throughout the chapter proceedings  and including the substantial cash payments that will be required in addition to the other sources of cash under the proposed plan if the proposed plan is confirmed 
the corporation achieved record net sales in  surpassing the previous record set in by 
demand for products sold by the corporation s north american gypsum and building products distribution operating segments increased in due to growth in new housing construction and a strong level of residential remodeling 
the corporation s worldwide ceilings operating segment also reported increased net sales for as compared with primarily due to higher selling prices for ceiling grid and tile 
shipments of gypsum wallboard were at record levels for the corporation and the industry in and are expected to be strong in the favorable level of activity in the new housing and repair and remodel markets and industry capacity utilization rates in excess of have resulted in a rise in market selling prices for gypsum wallboard 
the nationwide average realized selling price for united states gypsum company s sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard rose from the corporation s gross margin was in  up from in gross margin improved primarily as a result of higher selling prices for all major product lines and increased shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard 
voluntary reorganization under chapter on june  the petition date  the debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization the filing under the bankruptcy code

at the time of the filing  us gypsum was a defendant in more than  asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
us gypsum was also a defendant in asbestos lawsuits alleging property damage 
in addition  two subsidiaries  debtors l w supply and beadex  were defendants in a small number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
consequences of the filing as a consequence of the filing  all asbestos lawsuits and other lawsuits pending against the debtors as of the petition date are stayed  and no party may take any action to pursue or collect pre petition claims except pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court 
since the filing  the debtors have ceased making both cash payments and accruals with respect to asbestos lawsuits 
the debtors are operating their businesses without interruption as debtors in possession subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code  and vendors are being paid for goods furnished and services provided after the filing 
developments in the reorganization proceeding the debtors chapter cases are assigned to judge judith k 
fitzgerald  a bankruptcy court judge  and judge joy flowers conti  a federal district court judge 
judge conti hears matters relating to estimation of the debtors liability for asbestos personal injury claims 
other matters are heard by judge fitzgerald 
four official committees were appointed in the chapter cases the official committee of personal injury claimants or acc  the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants  the official committee of unsecured creditors and the official committee of equity security holders 
in addition  the bankruptcy court appointed dean m 
trafelet as the futures representative 
the appointed committees together with mr 
trafelet play significant roles in the chapter cases and the resolution of the chapter cases 
the debtors currently have the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization  and pursuant to the asbestos agreement  the debtors expect to file a proposed plan in february pursuant to the proposed plan  a trust would be created and funded by debtors pursuant to section g of the bankruptcy code  and this trust would compensate all qualifying present and future asbestos personal injury claims against the debtors 
if confirmed by the courts  the proposed plan would contain an injunction channeling all asbestos personal injury claims against the debtors to the section g trust for payment and precluding any individual or entity from bringing an asbestos personal injury claim against the debtors 
this channeling injunction would include any asbestos personal injury claims against the debtors relating to ap green and its affiliates 
the section g asbestos personal injury trust would be funded by the debtors on the effective date of the proposed plan by payment of million in cash  issuance of an interest bearing promissory note in the principal amount of million payable on december   and issuance of a contingent payment note in the amount of billion 
the contingent payment note of billion would be payable to the section g trust depending upon whether the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of or substantially similar legislation creating a national asbestos personal injury trust collectively  the fair act is enacted and made law by the th day after final adjournment of the th congress the trigger date 
with certain exceptions  outlined below  the debtors obligations under the billion contingent payment note would be cancelled if the fair act is enacted and made law by the trigger date 
if the fair act is not enacted and made law by the trigger date  or is enacted but held unconstitutional  the debtors would be obligated to make payments under the billion contingent payment note to the section g trust as follows billion of the contingent payment note would be payable within days after the trigger date  and the remaining billion of the contingent payment note would be payable within days after the trigger date 
interest would accrue on the billion payment beginning days after the trigger date 
each of the debtors would be co obligors and jointly and severally liable under both the million note and the billion contingent payment note 
the million note would be secured by percent of the voting stock of us gypsum 
the debtors would also grant to the section g trust a right to own percent of the voting stock of one of the reorganized debtors  exercisable upon the occurrence of specified contingencies  to secure payment of the first billion of the contingent payment note 
pursuant to the asbestos agreement  the proposed plan will also address the debtors obligations under the billion contingent payment note if the fair act is enacted by the trigger date but is subject to a constitutional challenge to its validity 
if there is a constitutional challenge within days of enactment  the debtors would be obligated to pay the billion note if the constitutional challenge results in a final  non appealable order that the fair act is i unconstitutional in its entirety  or ii unconstitutional insofar as it applies to debtors in chapter cases whose plans of reorganization had not yet been confirmed and become substantially consummated as defined in the asbestos agreement 
if the constitutional challenge is resolved by a final  non appealable order in any manner other than as described in the preceding sentence  then the billion contingent payment  including the right of the trust to own stock of one of the debtors  would be cancelled 
the asbestos agreement also requires that the debtors use their reasonable best efforts to have the proposed plan confirmed by the courts and effective july  the asbestos agreement provides further that if the proposed plan is not confirmed and effective by august   the asbestos agreement will be terminated unless extended by written agreement of the parties to the asbestos agreement  and the proposed plan might not be confirmed 
the debtors financial obligations under the proposed plan  if confirmed  would depend upon  among other things  whether the billion contingent payment note becomes due 
the debtors propose to fund their obligations under the proposed plan through accumulated cash  new debt financing  tax refunds  and a rights offering to the corporation s stockholders 
the debtors accumulated cash and marketable securities totaled billion as of december  the corporation expects to raise billion in new equity funding through a rights offering pursuant to which each stockholder as of the record date of the rights offering will receive a right to purchase  for each usg corporation common share held on that date  one new usg corporation common share at a price of 
if all stockholders were to exercise their right to purchase these additional shares  the percentage ownership of each stockholder in the corporation would remain unchanged by the rights offering 
these rights are expected to be freely tradeable during the offering period in which they are outstanding 
the date for the rights offering has not been established but the rights offering is not expected to commence prior to confirmation of the proposed plan 
subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court  the rights offering will be supported by a backstop equity commitment from berkshire hathaway inc  a current stockholder of the corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  berkshire hathaway inc has agreed to exercise all rights distributed to it in the rights offering and purchase from the corporation  at the same purchase price  all or substantially all of the shares that are not otherwise issued pursuant to the exercise of rights by other stockholders 
subject to approval of the bankruptcy court  the corporation would pay berkshire hathaway inc a fee of million as consideration for its commitment 
the bankruptcy court has scheduled a hearing regarding approval of the berkshire hathaway inc backstop equity commitment on february  it is possible that another entity may offer an alternative to the berkshire hathaway inc backstop commitment prior to the hearing 
the berkshire hathaway inc backstop equity commitment will expire on september   subject to extension to november   in certain circumstances  including the payment of an additional million fee 
in connection with the backstop equity commitment  the corporation and berkshire hathaway inc entered into a shareholder s agreement whereby berkshire hathaway inc agreed  among other things  that for a period of seven years following completion of the rights offering  except in limited circumstances  it would not acquire beneficial ownership of the corporation s voting securities if  after giving effect to the acquisition  berkshire hathaway inc would own more than of the corporation s voting securities or such higher percentage of voting securities that berkshire hathaway inc would own after making any purchases required under the backstop equity commitment described above 
berkshire hathaway inc further agreed that  during such seven year period  it would not solicit proxies with respect to securities of the corporation or submit a proposal or offer involving a merger  acquisition or other extraordinary transaction unless such proposal or offer is i requested by the corporation s board of directors  or ii made to the board of directors confidentially  is approved by a majority of the voting power of the corporation not owned by berkshire hathaway inc and is determined by the independent members of the board of directors to be fair to the stockholders 
the shareholder s agreement also provides that  with certain exceptions  any new shares of common stock acquired by berkshire hathaway inc in excess of those owned on the date of the agreement and shares distributed on those shares  including in the rights offering will be voted proportionally with all voting shares 
the parties also entered into a registration rights agreement whereby the corporation granted berkshire hathaway inc registration rights with respect to its shares of the corporation s common stock 
in addition to accumulated cash and the rights offering  the corporation also expects to fund its obligations under the proposed plan  if confirmed  through about billion of financing in the second half of if the billion contingent payment note becomes due 
further  the corporation s cash contributions to the section g asbestos trust would be tax deductible and would be expected to generate a cash tax refund based upon a net operating loss that would be created 
assuming that the billion contingent payment note becomes due and is payable to the section g asbestos trust  the corporation would expect to receive a cash tax refund of about billion 
if this tax refund has not been received by the corporation when the final payment is due to the trust  the corporation would likely require additional debt financing to make such payment 
there are numerous factors and conditions that will affect confirmation of the proposed plan 
these include  among others  the following requirements the class or classes of claimants whose claims are to be addressed by the section g asbestos personal injury trust must be established and vote in favor of the proposed plan by at least of those voting  the bankruptcy court or the united states district court for the district of delaware the district court must issue various findings of fact and conclusions of law required to create a section g asbestos personal injury trust and issue an injunction channeling all asbestos personal injury claims against debtors to the section g trust  including the findings that the asbestos trust is designed to pay present claims and future demands that involve similar claims in substantially the same manner and that the trust own  or have the right to acquire if specified contingencies occur  a majority of the voting stock of a relevant debtor  its parent corporation  or a subsidiary that is also a debtor  the bankruptcy court or the district court must issue various findings that the proposed plan complies with all other applicable requirements of the bankruptcy code  the bankruptcy court or the district court must enter a confirmation order and  if the bankruptcy court enters the confirmation order  the district court must affirm it  and the bankruptcy court and the district court  as required  must enter the section g injunction set forth in the proposed plan 
the asbestos agreement also requires that the proposed plan must be confirmed and become effective no later than august  unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the asbestos agreement 
the failure to resolve disputes with any objectors to the proposed plan could materially hinder satisfaction of the requirement in the asbestos agreement that the proposed plan be effective by august  if the proposed plan  or a substantially similar plan  is not confirmed  the amount of debtors present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities will be unresolved 
in such a situation  the amount of those liabilities may be resolved through litigation which was pending at the time the asbestos agreement was reached 
proceedings relating to estimation of the debtors asbestos personal injury liabilities were pending before judge conti at that time 
the parties to the asbestos agreement have agreed to seek a stay of the estimation proceedings 
proceedings relating to whether debtors other than us gypsum are responsible for us gypsum s asbestos liabilities and whether the debtors are responsible for the asbestos liabilities of ap green were pending before judge fitzgerald 
at the time the asbestos agreement was reached  there were key  contested issues among the parties relevant to estimation of debtors asbestos personal injury liabilities that were being addressed in the estimation litigation proceeding before judge conti 
those key issues included whether claimants who do not have objective evidence of asbestos related disease are entitled to be compensated by debtors and whether such claimants are entitled to vote on any plan of reorganization  the characteristics and number of present and future claimants who are likely to have had exposure to the debtors asbestos containing products sufficient to cause disease  whether the particular type of asbestos present in certain of the debtors products during the relevant time has been shown to cause cancer  and the appropriate claim values to apply to legitimate present and future asbestos personal injury claims 
at the time the asbestos agreement was reached  there were also litigation proceedings before judge fitzgerald relating to whether debtors other than us gypsum have responsibility for us gypsum s asbestos liabilities and whether the debtors have responsibility for the asbestos liabilities of ap green 
in  the debtors other than us gypsum filed a complaint requesting a ruling that the assets of the debtors other than us gypsum are not available to satisfy the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum 
the acc and the futures representative opposed the debtors in these proceedings 
the acc and the futures representative have alleged that the asbestos personal injury liabilities of us gypsum exceed its value  and  in opposition to the debtors complaint  the acc and the futures representative filed counterclaims seeking a ruling that the assets of all debtors are available to satisfy the asbestos liabilities of us gypsum under various asserted legal grounds  including successor liability  piercing the corporate veil  and substantive consolidation 
the acc and the futures representative also have alleged that the debtors are liable for claims arising from the sale of asbestos containing products by ap green 
they allege that ap gypsum is responsible for ap green s asbestos liabilities due to us gypsum s acquisition by merger of us green in and that  pursuant to the merger documents  us gypsum assumed us green s liabilities 
they further allege that because the debtors other than us gypsum are liable for us gypsum s liabilities  the other debtors are therefore liable for ap green s liabilities 
the official committee of asbestos property damage claimants asserted similar counterclaims 
the proposed plan  if confirmed  would resolve the issue of debtors liability for present and future asbestos personal injury claims relating to ap green by channeling those claims to the section g trust created pursuant to the proposed plan 
ap green  which manufactured and sold refractory products  was acquired through a merger of ap green into ap gypsum on december  on the next business day after the merger  january   us gypsum conveyed us green s assets and liabilities to a newly formed delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of us gypsum  also called ap green refractories co 
this newly formed corporation is also referred to herein as ap green 
ap green was operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of us gypsum until  at which time us green became a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation 
in  ap green became a publicly traded company when its shares were distributed to the stockholders of the corporation 
in february  ap green now known as ap green industries  inc as well as its parent company  global industrial technologies  inc  and other affiliates filed voluntary petitions for reorganization through which ap green and its affiliates seek to resolve their asbestos liabilities through creation and funding of a section g trust 
the ap green reorganization proceeding is pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania and is captioned in re global industrial technologies  inc case no 

in september  the debtors in the ap green reorganization proceeding filed a proposed plan of reorganization which  if approved  would resolve the asbestos liabilities of the debtors in that proceeding by channeling those asbestos liabilities to a trust created under section g of the bankruptcy code 
the plan documents specifically exclude us gypsum from the protection of the proposed channeling injunction 
the proposed plan of reorganization in the ap green proceedings has not been confirmed 
a confirmation hearing is scheduled for june  the ap green plan documents state that the trust that will address asbestos claims against ap green will be funded with approximately million in insurance proceeds and of the stock of a corporate affiliate of ap green 
the plan documents state that  as of ap green s petition date  about  asbestos related claims were pending against it and about  such claims were pending against an affiliate 
prior to its petition date  ap green had resolved about  asbestos related claims for about million in indemnity costs 
in addition  ap green had resolved approximately  asbestos related claims in the aggregate amount of million  which were unpaid as of the petition date 
these  claims are included in the  pending claims referenced above 
the proposed plan to be filed by the debtors in their chapter cases contemplates that all asbestos personal injury claims against the debtors relating to ap green will be channeled to the debtors section g trust 
however  the proposed plan is subject to numerous conditions 
there is no guarantee that the proposed plan will be confirmed 
if the proposed plan is not confirmed  the debtors will remain in chapter  the amount of debtors present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities will be unresolved  and the terms and timing of any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed in debtors chapter cases are unknown 
in such a situation  it cannot be known what amount will be necessary to resolve debtors present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities  including alleged liabilities relating to ap green  how the plan of reorganization ultimately approved will treat other pre petition claims  whether there will be sufficient assets to satisfy debtors pre petition liabilities  and what impact any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed may have on the value of the shares of the corporation s common stock or other securities 
the interests of the corporation s stockholders may be substantially diluted or cancelled in whole or in part 
potential federal legislation regarding asbestos personal injury claims on april   senator arlen specter  r pa  introduced in the united states senate legislation addressing compensation and administration of asbestos personal injury claims 
the legislation is titled the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of senate bill  the fair act of or the act 
the fair act of is co sponsored by republican senators and three democratic senators 
the act was referred to the senate committee on the judiciary and was approved by the committee on may   with senators voting in favor of the bill and five voting against it 
however  several senators on the committee who voted in favor of the bill stated that additional changes must be made to the act in order for them to vote in favor of passage of the bill by the full senate 
the fair act of has not been approved by the full senate  has not been considered by the house of representatives  is not law and may not become law 
the fair act of approved by the senate judiciary committee is intended to establish a nationally administered trust fund to compensate asbestos personal injury claimants 
in the act s current form  companies that have made past payments for asbestos personal injury claims would be required to contribute amounts on a periodic basis to a national trust fund that would pay the claims of qualifying asbestos personal injury claimants 
the nationally administered trust fund would be the exclusive remedy for asbestos personal injury claims  and such claims could not be brought in state or federal court as long as such claims are being compensated under the national trust fund 
a copy of the fair act of as introduced is available at http thomas 
loc 
gov type in s 
in the search field 
in the act s current form  the amounts to be paid to the national trust fund are based on an allocation methodology set forth in the act 
in addition to the annual payments required under the allocation methodology  defendant participants may be subject to surcharges under certain circumstances  including but not limited to a failure of the scheduled contributions to meet the defendant participants guaranteed annual funding requirements under the act 
the amounts that participants  including the debtors  would be required to pay are not dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding 
in addition  the act  in its current form  requires affected companies currently in chapter  including the debtors  to make their first payment to the national trust fund not later than days after enactment of the fair act of  notwithstanding the fact that the companies are still in chapter proceedings 
the act also provides  among other things  that if it is determined that the money in the trust fund is not sufficient to compensate eligible claimants  the claimants and defendants including current chapter debtors would return to the court system to resolve claims not paid by the national trust fund 
as stated above  pursuant to the proposed plan to be filed by debtors  the amount that debtors would be required to pay into the section g asbestos personal injury trust would be contingent upon whether the fair act of or substantially similar legislation collectively  the fair act is enacted by congress by a date specified in the proposed plan 
the outcome of the legislative process is inherently speculative  and it cannot be known whether the fair act will ever be enacted or  if enacted  what the terms of the final legislation might be 
previously  in april  a similar  but not identical  bill the fairness in asbestos injury resolution act of was introduced in the senate and was approved by the senate committee on the judiciary  but the full senate defeated a motion to proceed with floor consideration of the bill 
enactment of the fair act addressing the financial contributions of the debtors for asbestos personal injury claims would have a material impact on the amount the debtors would be required to pay into its section g trust if the proposed plan is confirmed  and  even if the proposed plan is not confirmed  enactment of such legislation would materially impact the amount of the debtors asbestos personal injury liability 
see consequences of the filing  above  and part ii  item  note  litigation 
estimated cost of asbestos liability prior to the filing  in the fourth quarter of  us gypsum recorded a noncash  pretax provision of million  increasing to billion its total accrued reserve for resolving in the tort system the asbestos personal injury and property damage claims pending as of december   and asbestos personal injury claims expected to be filed through at that time  the estimated range of us gypsum s probable liability for such claims was between million and billion  including defense costs 
these amounts are stated before tax benefit and are not discounted to present value 
as of september   the corporation s accrued reserve for asbestos claims totaled billion 
as a result of the asbestos agreement and proposed plan  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a pretax charge of billion billion  or per share  after tax for all asbestos related claims  increasing the reserve for all asbestos related claims to billion as of december  this reserve includes the debtors obligations to fund asbestos personal injury claims as will be set forth in the proposed plan recorded at billion on the assumption that the proposed plan is confirmed but that the fair act is not enacted as set forth in the proposed plan 
this reserve also includes the debtors estimate of the cost of resolving asbestos property damage claims filed in their chapter cases  including estimated legal fees associated with those claims  and the debtors estimate of resolving other asbestos related claims and legal expenses associated with those claims 
if the proposed plan is not confirmed  the amount of debtors asbestos personal injury liabilities will not be resolved and will likely be subject to substantial dispute and uncertainty 
in that event  if the amount of such liabilities is not resolved through negotiation or through federal asbestos legislation  such liabilities likely will be determined by the court in an estimation proceeding in the bankruptcy 
the amount of debtors liabilities for asbestos personal injury liabilities could be determined to be significantly different than the currently accrued reserve 
this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  cash flows  and results of operations in the period recorded 
potential outcomes of the filing if the proposed plan is confirmed  all present and future asbestos personal injury claims against the debtors would be channeled to a section g trust  and no individual or entity may thereafter bring an asbestos personal injury claim against debtors 
under the proposed plan  allowed claims of other creditors  including allowed claims of general unsecured creditors  would be paid in full  with interest where required 
shareholders of the corporation as of the effective date of the proposed plan would retain their shares and  pursuant to a proposed shareholder rights offering  would have the right to purchase  at per share  one new common share of the corporation for each share owned as of the date of the rights offering 
the amount that the debtors would pay to the section g asbestos personal injury trust depends upon whether national legislation creating a trust for payment of asbestos personal injury claims is enacted before the date specified in the proposed plan 
if such legislation is enacted before the specified date  the debtors funding obligation to the section g trust would be million 
if such legislation is not enacted before the specified date  or is enacted but held unconstitutional  the debtors funding obligation to the section g trust would total billion 
the asbestos agreement is subject to numerous conditions  including the requirement in the asbestos agreement that the proposed plan be confirmed and effective no later than august  there is no guarantee that the proposed plan will be confirmed

provision for asbestos claims as a result of the asbestos agreement and proposed plan  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a pretax charge of billion billion  or per share  after tax 
this charge is related to an increase in the reserve for the estimated cost of resolving asbestos related liabilities  including asbestos personal injury claims  asbestos property damage claims  other asbestos related claims  and associated legal expenses 
the provision of billion  combined with the existing asbestos related reserve of billion  resulted in a total reserve as of december   of billion

during the third quarter of  the corporation s income tax provision was reduced and consolidated net earnings increased by million due to the completion by the internal revenue service of its audit of the corporation s federal income tax returns for the years through as a result of the audit  the corporation s federal income tax liability for the years through was increased by million in the aggregate  which was covered by liabilities previously recorded on the corporation s financial statements 
in addition  due to the results of the audit  a portion of the corporation s recorded income tax contingency reserves became unnecessary and were eliminated 
this reduction was offset by an increase of million million net of federal benefit in the valuation allowance relating to the corporation s reserve for asbestos claims in the fourth quarter of the increase in the effective tax rate versus was primarily attributable to a reduction of the corporation s income tax payable during this reduction was determined upon completion of the corporation s federal income tax return and resulted from an actual tax liability that was lower than the estimate of taxes payable as of december  cumulative effect of accounting change in december  the corporation adopted fin a noncash  after tax charge of million million pretax was reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of december  in january  the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

in addition  record shipments and selling prices were realized for sheetrock r brand joint compound and fiberock r brand gypsum fiber panels 
shipments of sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard totaled billion square feet in  up from the previous record of billion square feet in us gypsum s wallboard plants operated at of capacity in compared with in industry shipments of gypsum wallboard increased by approximately from while us gypsum has realized stronger demand  it also has experienced significant cost pressures  as energy  freight and raw material prices have increased significantly 
these cost increases have been offset by increased industry pricing  which reflects the strong demand and high industry capacity utilization rates 
in  us gypsum s nationwide average realized selling price for sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard was per thousand square feet  up from in in the fourth quarter of  us gypsum s nationwide average realized selling price reached  also up from the prior year period 
comparing with  net sales increased  and operating profit more than doubled primarily due to increased shipments and higher selling prices for its major product lines

the increased shipments and improved pricing for all major products as well as the implementation of various cost saving initiatives and improved production efficiencies at us gypsum s wallboard plants more than offset higher manufacturing costs in the higher costs were primarily for wastepaper a raw material used to produce the facing and backing of gypsum wallboard and natural gas 
cgc inc net sales and operating profit in for the gypsum business of canada based cgc inc cgc increased and  respectively  versus primarily due to the favorable effects of currency translation 
higher selling prices for cgc s sheetrock r brand gypsum wallboard  partially offset by lower volume and higher manufacturing costs  also contributed to the improved level of operating profit

worldwide ceilings net sales in increased versus  while operating profit was unchanged 
net sales and operating profit in increased and  respectively  from usg interiors  inc net sales in for the corporation s domestic ceilings business were million  a million increase from  as higher selling prices for ceiling grid and tile were partially offset by lower shipments of these products 
operating profit of million  which also represented a slight increase from  was favorably affected by a variation in last in  first out lifo reserve adjustments for ceiling tile and grid inventory 
these adjustments accounted for a million year on year increase in operating profit  which was offset to a large extent by higher energy  freight and raw material costs for ceiling grid and tile 
comparing with  net sales and operating profit rose and  respectively 
these increases primarily reflected higher selling prices for ceiling grid and tile  while shipments of these product lines were virtually unchanged 
steel is a major component in the production of ceiling grid  and in the first half of  market concerns over a global steel shortage and rising steel costs led to a surge in demand for ceiling grid 
in the second half of  demand for grid dropped sharply as a result of the pre buying in the first half of the year 
in addition  the cost of steel rose throughout the year  leading to higher costs to produce grid and inventory steel 
usg international net sales for usg international were up from primarily due to increased demand in latin america and the pacific region

shipments of gypsum wallboard were up  while selling prices rose compared with market conditions and outlook industry shipments of gypsum wallboard in the united states were an estimated billion square feet in  an all time record and a increase from the previous record level of billion square feet in new housing construction continued on a strong pace in based on preliminary data issued by the us bureau of the census  us housing starts in were an estimated million units  the highest level since  compared with actual housing starts of million units in and million units in the repair and remodel market  which includes renovation of both residential and nonresidential buildings  accounts for the second largest portion of the corporation s sales  behind new housing construction 
because many buyers begin to remodel an existing home within two years of purchase  opportunity from the residential repair and remodel market in was strong  as sales of existing homes in are estimated at million units  exceeding s level of million units 
the growth in new housing construction and strong residential remodeling resulted in the record shipments of gypsum wallboard described above 
these two markets  which together account for nearly two thirds of all demand for gypsum wallboard  and utilization rates in excess of for the industry resulted in a rise of market selling prices for gypsum wallboard in future demand for the corporation s products from new nonresidential construction is determined by floor space for which contracts are signed 
installation of gypsum and ceilings products follows signing of construction contracts by about a year 
after a moderate increase in  total floor space for which contracts were signed was relatively unchanged in segment results were mixed as investment in office space declined while education construction increased slightly 
the outlook for the corporation s markets in remains positive 
however  signs of moderation in demand indicators  such as housing starts  and rising mortgage interest rates could reduce the level of demand from both the new housing and residential remodeling markets in the coming year 
the fundamentals for nonresidential building remain solid  and modest growth is expected in this market in in addition  the corporation  like many other companies  faces many ongoing cost pressures in the areas of energy and raw materials 
in this environment  the corporation continues to focus its attention and investments on improving customer service  manufacturing costs and operating efficiencies  as well as investing to grow its businesses 
in addition  the corporation is dedicated to completing the transactions announced for emerging from the chapter proceedings during liquidity and capital resources liquidity as of december   the corporation had billion of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities  up million  or  from billion as of december  of the total december   amount  million was held by non debtor subsidiaries 
since the petition date  the corporation s level of liquidity has increased due to strong operating cash flows and the absence of cash payments related to asbestos settlements and interest on pre petition debt 
during the bankruptcy proceeding  the corporation expects to have limited ability to access capital other than its own cash  marketable securities and future cash flows to fund potential future growth opportunities such as new products  acquisitions and joint ventures 
nonetheless  the corporation expects to be able to maintain a program of capital spending aimed at maintaining and enhancing its businesses 
under the proposed plan  the section g asbestos personal injury trust would be funded by the debtors on the effective date of the proposed plan by payment of million in cash  issuance of an interest bearing promissory note in the principal amount of million payable on december   and issuance of a contingent payment note in the amount of billion 
the contingent payment note of billion would be payable to the section g trust depending upon whether the fair act is enacted and made law by the trigger date 
with certain exceptions  outlined above  the debtors obligations under the billion contingent payment note would be cancelled if the fair act is enacted and made law by the trigger date 
if the fair act is not enacted and made law by the trigger date  or is enacted but held unconstitutional  the debtors would be obligated to make payments under the billion contingent payment note to the section g trust as follows billion of the contingent payment note would be payable within days after the trigger date  and the remaining billion of the contingent payment note would be payable within days after the trigger date 
interest would accrue on the billion payment beginning days after the trigger date 
the debtors propose to fund their obligations through the billion of accumulated cash  a rights offering to the corporation s stockholders that is expected to raise billion in new equity funding  new debt financing of about billion  and tax refunds of about billion generated from the debtors contributions to the section g trust

the corporation s marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
letters of credit and restricted cash the corporation has a million credit agreement  which expires april   with lasalle bank na the lasalle facility to provide letters of credit needed to support business operations 
as of december   there were outstanding million of letters of credit under the lasalle facility  which are cash collateralized at 
as of december   a total of million was reported as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
restricted cash primarily represented collateral to support outstanding letters of credit 
debt as of december   total debt amounted to billion  all of which was included in liabilities subject to compromise 
as of december   total debt amounted to billion  of which billion was included in liabilities subject to compromise 
these amounts do not include any accruals for post petition contractual interest expense 
realization of deferred tax asset the corporation s consolidated balance sheet as of december   includes a net long term deferred tax asset of billion 
included in this amount is a deferred tax asset of billion relating to the us federal and state income tax benefits expected to be realized in future years with respect to the billion of asbestos reserves recorded by the corporation as of december  management has concluded  based on the weight of available evidence  that all but million of these tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized in the future  consequently  a valuation allowance of million has been established with respect to this deferred tax asset as of december  in arriving at its conclusion  management has considered both the federal taxable income reported by the corporation for the through taxable years as well as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and projections of future taxable income 
in the taxable year s in which the corporation s asbestos reserves are satisfied  the related federal income tax deduction will create a net operating loss 
under the internal revenue code  a net operating loss resulting from the payment of asbestos claims including cash contributions to a section g trust can be carried back and offset against the corporation s federal taxable income in the preceding years  generating a refund of taxes paid in those years 
since the corporation has reported or expects to report federal taxable income of billion  in the aggregate  for the years through  it is more likely than not that it will realize the federal deferred tax asset relating to the corporation s asbestos reserves 
in contrast to the results under the internal revenue code  most us states do not allow the carryback of a net operating loss in any significant amount 
as a result  most all of the state tax benefits relating to the corporation s payment of asbestos claims will be realized through a reduction of future state income tax liabilities by offsetting a net operating loss resulting from the payment of asbestos claims against future state taxable income 
based on projections of future taxable income consistent with historical results and anticipated future trends in the us states in which the corporation conducts business operations and the loss carryforward periods allowed by current state laws  management has concluded that all but million of the deferred tax asset relating to the corporation s asbestos reserves is more likely than not to be realized

in addition to the outstanding letters of credit discussed above see restricted cash and letters of credit  the corporation also had million of outstanding letters of credit under a pre petition revolving credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank formerly the chase manhattan bank 
to the extent that any of these letters of credit are drawn  jpmorgan chase bank would assert a pre petition claim in a corresponding amount against the corporation in the bankruptcy proceeding 
legal contingencies as a result of the filing  all pending asbestos lawsuits against the debtors are stayed  and no party may take any action to pursue or collect on such asbestos claims absent specific authorization of the bankruptcy court 
us gypsum has also been named as a defendant in lawsuits claiming personal injury from exposure to silica allegedly from us gypsum products

critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the corporation believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
voluntary reorganization under chapter as a result of the filing  the corporation s consolidated financial statements reflect the provisions of sop and are prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
however  as a result of the filing  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities  without substantial adjustments and or changes of ownership  are subject to uncertainty 
given this uncertainty  there is substantial doubt about the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern 
such doubt includes  but is not limited to  a possible change in control of the corporation  as well as a potential change in the composition of the corporation s business portfolio 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
while operating as debtors in possession under the protection of chapter of the bankruptcy code and subject to bankruptcy court approval or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business  one or more of the debtors may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
further  a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated financial statements 
one of the key provisions of sop requires the reporting of the debtors liabilities incurred prior to the commencement of the chapter cases as liabilities subject to compromise 
the various liabilities that are subject to compromise include us gypsum s asbestos reserve and the debtors pre petition debt  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the amounts for these items represent the debtors estimate of known or potential pre petition claims to be resolved in connection with the chapter cases 
such claims remain subject to future adjustments 
adjustments may result from i negotiations  ii actions of the bankruptcy court  iii further developments with respect to disputed claims  iv rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases  v the determination as to the value of any collateral securing claims  vi proofs of claim  including unaccrued and unrecorded post petition interest expense  vii effect of any legislation which may be enacted or viii other events 
in particular  the amount of the asbestos reserve reflects us gypsum s pre petition estimate of liability associated with asbestos claims expected to be filed against us gypsum in the tort system through  and this liability  in addition to liability for post claims  is the subject of significant dispute in the chapter cases 
other provisions of sop involve interest expense and interest income 
interest expense on debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise is not accrued or recorded 
interest income on cash accumulated during the bankruptcy process to settle claims under a plan of reorganization is netted against chapter reorganization expenses 
see part ii  item  note  voluntary reorganization under chapter  for additional information related to the filing 
asbestos liability in  prior to the filing  an independent consultant completed an actuarial study of us gypsum s current and potential future asbestos liabilities 
this study was based on the assumption that us gypsum s asbestos liability would continue to be resolved in the tort system 
as part of this study  the corporation and its independent consultant considered various factors that would impact the amount of us gypsum s asbestos personal injury liability 
these factors included the number  disease  age  and occupational characteristics of claimants in the personal injury cases  the jurisdiction and venue in which such cases were filed  the viability of claims for conspiracy or punitive damages  the elimination of indemnity sharing among center members  including us gypsum  for future settlements and its negative impact on us gypsum s ability to continue to resolve claims at historical or acceptable levels  the adverse impact on us gypsum s settlement costs of recent bankruptcies of co defendants  the possibility of additional bankruptcies of other defendants  the possibility of significant adverse verdicts due to recent changes in settlement strategies and related effects on liquidity  the inability or refusal of former center members to fund their share of existing settlements and its effect on such settlement agreements  allegations that us gypsum and the other center members are responsible for the share of certain settlement agreements that was to be paid by former members that have refused or are unable to pay  the continued ability to negotiate settlements or develop other mechanisms that defer or reduce claims from unimpaired claimants  the possibility that federal legislation addressing asbestos litigation would be enacted  epidemiological data concerning the incidence of past and projected future asbestos related diseases  trends in the propensity of persons alleging asbestos related disease to sue us gypsum  the pre agreed settlement recommendations in  and the viability of  the long term settlements  anticipated trends in recruitment of non malignant or unimpaired claimants by plaintiffs law firms  and future defense costs 
the study attempted to weigh relevant variables and assess the impact of likely outcomes on future case filings and settlement costs 
in connection with the property damage cases  the corporation considered  among other things  the extent to which claimants could identify the manufacturer of any alleged asbestos containing products in the buildings at issue in each case  the amount of asbestos containing products at issue  the claimed damages  the viability of statute of limitations and other defenses  the amount for which such cases can be resolved  which normally but not uniformly has been substantially lower than the claimed damages  and the viability of claims for punitive and other forms of multiple damages 
based upon the results of the actuarial study  the corporation determined that  although substantial uncertainty remained  it was probable that asbestos claims personal injury and property damage then pending against us gypsum and future asbestos personal injury claims to be filed against it through could be resolved in the tort system for an amount between million and billion  including defense costs  and that within this range the most likely estimate was billion 
consistent with this analysis  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a noncash  pretax charge of million to results of operations  which  combined with the previously existing reserve  increased us gypsum s reserve for asbestos claims to billion 
these amounts are stated before tax benefit and are not discounted to present value 
less than of the reserve was attributable to defense and administrative costs 
at the time of recording this reserve  it was expected that the reserve amounts would be expended over a period extending several years beyond  because asbestos cases in the tort system historically had been resolved an average of three years after filing 
the corporation concluded that it did not have adequate information to allow it to reasonably estimate us gypsum s liability for asbestos claims to be filed after after the filing  the asbestos reserve was not revised as the corporation was unable to estimate the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings regarding the estimation of debtors asbestos liability 
as a result of the asbestos agreement and proposed plan  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a pretax charge of billion billion  or per share  after tax for all asbestos related claims  increasing the reserve for all asbestos related claims to billion 
this reserve includes the debtors obligations to fund asbestos personal injury claims as will be set forth in the proposed plan recorded at billion on the assumption that the proposed plan is confirmed but that the fair act is not enacted as set forth in the proposed plan  the debtors estimate of the cost of resolving asbestos property damage claims filed in its chapter proceedings  including estimated legal fees associated with those claims  and the debtors estimate of resolving other asbestos related claims and legal expenses associated with those claims 
if the proposed plan is not confirmed  the amount of debtors asbestos personal injury liabilities will not be resolved and will likely be subject to substantial dispute and uncertainty 
in that event  if the amount of such liabilities is not resolved through negotiation or through federal asbestos legislation  such liabilities likely will be determined through litigation in the bankruptcy proceeding 
the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and the futures representative have stated in a court filing that they estimate that the net present value of the debtors present and future asbestos personal injury liabilities is approximately billion and that the debtors are insolvent 
the debtors have stated that they believe they are solvent if their asbestos liabilities are fairly and appropriately valued 
if the proposed plan is not confirmed  the amount of debtors liabilities for asbestos personal injury liabilities could ultimately be determined to be significantly different from the currently accrued reserve 
this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  cash flows and results of operations in the period recorded 
see part ii  item  note  litigation  for additional information on the background of asbestos litigation  developments in the corporation s reorganization proceeding and defined terms 
employee retirement plans the corporation and its major subsidiaries generally have contributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees 
plans that provide postretirement benefits retiree health care and life insurance for eligible employees also are maintained by the corporation 
for accounting purposes  these plans are dependent on assumptions made by management  which are used by actuaries engaged by the corporation to calculate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the annual expense recognized for these plans 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates primarily include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for the funded plans  compensation increase rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and  for postretirement benefits  health care cost trend rates 
at december   the assumed discount rate was determined based on the hewitt yield curve the hyc  which was designed by hewitt associates to provide a means for plan sponsors to value the liabilities of their defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the hyc is a hypothetical double a yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates 
each bond issue underlying the hyc is required to have a rating of aa or better by moody s investor service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s 
prior to using the hyc  the assumed discount rate was developed by using as a benchmark the yield on investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better with terms that approximated the average duration of the corporation s obligations 
the use of a different discount rate would impact net pension and postretirement benefit costs and benefit obligations 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the corporation uses a building block approach  which incorporates historical experience  its pension plan investment guidelines and expectations for long term rates of return 
the use of a different rate of return would impact net pension costs 
a one half percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and return on plan asset rate would have the following effects dollars in millions increase decrease in projected percentage net annual benefit assumption change benefit cost obligation pension benefits discount rate increase discount rate decrease asset return increase asset return decrease postretirement benefits discount rate increase discount rate decrease compensation increase rates are based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience  while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality rates 
health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data and an assessment of likely long term trends 
results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the net benefit cost of future periods 
the sensitivity of assumptions reflects the impact of changing one assumption at a time and is specific to conditions at the end of economic factors and conditions could affect multiple assumptions simultaneously  and the effects of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear 
see part ii  item  note  employee retirement plans  for additional information regarding costs  plan obligations  plan assets  assumptions and the health care cost trend rate 
self insurance reserves the corporation purchases insurance from third parties for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed certain levels 
however  the corporation is responsible for the payment of claims up to such levels 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred and incurred but not reported losses  the corporation utilizes estimates prepared by actuarial consultants 
these estimates utilize the corporation s historical data to project the future development of losses and take into account the impact of the corporation s bankruptcy proceedings 
the corporation monitors and reviews all estimates and related assumptions for reasonableness 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
revenue recognition for the majority of the corporation s sales  revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products to customers  which is when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
however  for the corporation s building products distribution segment  revenue is recognized and title and risk of loss are transferred when customers receive products  either through delivery by company trucks or customer pickup 
the corporation believes that these revenue recognition points are appropriate  as the corporation has no further performance obligations unless the customer notifies the corporation of shortage of products or defective products shipped within five days after receipt of such products 
with the exception of building products distribution  the corporation s products are generally shipped free on board fob shipping point 
provisions for discounts to customers are recorded based on the terms of sale in the same period in which the related sales are recorded 
the corporation also records estimated reductions to revenue for shortage of products or defective products  customer programs and incentive offerings  including promotions and other volume based incentives  based on historical information and review of major customer activity 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the corporation adopted fin  accounting for conditional asset retirements
