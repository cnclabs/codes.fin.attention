item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview covance is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range of early stage and late stage product development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to the chemical  agrochemical and food industries 
the foregoing services comprise two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes early development services  which includes preclinical and clinical pharmacology service offerings  and late stage development services  which includes central laboratory  clinical development  periapproval  cardiac safety services  and market access services 
although each segment has separate services within it  they can be combined in joint service offerings and we believe clients increasingly are interested in the opportunities for such combined services 
covance believes it is one of the largest drug development services companies  based on annual net revenues  and one of a few that is capable of providing comprehensive global product development services 
covance offers its clients high quality services designed to provide data to clients as rapidly as possible and reduce product development time 
we believe this enables covance s customers to introduce their products into the marketplace faster and as a result  maximize the period of market exclusivity and monetary return on their research and development investments 
additionally  covance s comprehensive services and broad experience provide its customers with a variable cost alternative to fixed cost internal development capabilities 
critical accounting policies covance s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered  depending upon the nature of the work contracted 
historically  a majority of covance s net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years  but can extend in duration up to five years or longer 
service contracts generally take the form of fee for service or fixed price arrangements 
in the case of fee for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  based upon  for example  hours worked or samples tested 
for long term fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  with performance generally assessed using output measures  such as units of work performed to date as compared to the total units of work contracted 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of contract pricing terms 
renegotiated amounts are not included in net revenues until earned and realization is assured 
estimates of costs to complete are made to provide  where appropriate  for losses expected on contracts 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
in some cases  for multi year contracts  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed  as discussed above 
additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance based milestones over the contract duration 
most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice 
these contracts typically require payment to covance of expenses to wind down the study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by covance under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured 
bad debts 
covance endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business 
covance maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected 
this bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management s judgment  actual bad debt write offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded 
historically bad debt write offs have not been material 
taxes on income 
since covance conducts operations on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
covance s profits are further impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of covance s pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  covance s effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
covance has established  and periodically reviews and reevaluates  an estimated income tax reserve which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet 
this income tax reserve is for exposures related to matters such as transfer pricing  nexus  deemed dividends and the allocation of overhead costs across various federal  state and foreign income tax jurisdictions 
an accrual is established at the time an exposure is identified when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of the accrual for each item for which an exposure exists is adjusted when either a matters are settled at amounts which are different than the amount included in the reserve or b when facts indicate a significant change in either the probability or estimated amount of the potential exposure 
while covance believes that it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures will be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is possible that changes in estimates in the future could cause covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its income tax reserve 
in addition  covance s policy is to provide income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries only to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted 
on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
among other things  the act provided a temporary incentive for multi national companies to repatriate previously unremitted foreign earnings by allowing companies a special one time tax deduction equal to of qualified foreign earnings that were repatriated 
during the fourth quarter of  covance repatriated million in foreign earnings under the act  which resulted in the recording of an income tax charge of million or diluted share 
covance s historical policy has been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the united states 
except for the amounts repatriated in the fourth quarter of under the act  covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the united states 
as a result  taxes have not been provided on any accumulated foreign unremitted earnings as of december  stock based compensation 
covance grants stock options to its employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounts for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
see recently issued accounting standards 
impairment of assets 
covance reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon covance s judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
covance performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter 
this test is performed by comparing  at the reporting unit level  the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 
covance assesses fair value based upon its best estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to be generated by the reporting unit 
the test performed for did not identify any instances of impairment 
however  changes in expectations as to the present value of the reporting unit s future cash flows might impact subsequent years assessments of impairment 
defined benefit pension plans 
covance sponsors defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at three foreign subsidiaries 
the measurement of the related pension benefit obligation and the expense recorded in each year is based upon actuarial computations which require judgment as to a the appropriate discount rate to use in computing the present value of the benefit obligation  b the expected return on plan assets and c the expected future rate of salary increases 
actual results will likely differ  in some periods materially  from the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations 
foreign currency risks since covance operates on a global basis  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts covance executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular covance subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by covance s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon covance s consolidated financial results 
see risk factors 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  covance recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in covance receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by covance as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in covance s consolidated statements of income 
finally  covance s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting covance s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
at december   the accumulated other comprehensive income cumulative translation account balance was million 
operating expenses and reimbursable out of pockets covance segregates its recurring operating expenses among four categories cost of revenue  reimbursed out of pocket expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefits  other direct costs  shipping and handling fees  and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenues  tends and is expected to fluctuate from one period to another  as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involving hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  advertising and promotional expenses  administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs  and excludes depreciation and amortization 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to investigators  volunteers and other out of pocket costs such as for travel  printing  meetings  couriers  etc  for which it is reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profit 
investigator fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor  passing through these costs without risk or reward to covance 
all other out of pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenues increased to billion for from billion for net revenues from covance s early development segment grew on the strong broad based performance across the segment s service offerings 
net revenues from covance s late stage development segment increased on the strong broad based performance across this segment s service offerings 
cost of revenue increased to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
gross margins were for each of the years ended december  and december  overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined basis points to in from in depreciation and amortization increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for income from operations increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period on the strong broad based performance across the segment s service offerings 
income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by strong performances in our central laboratory and cardiac safety services 
corporate expense increased million to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the increase is primarily attributable to increased centralized information technology and human resources costs  incentive compensation accruals and professional fees 
other income  net of million for increased million compared to million for this increase is the result of a million increase in interest income due primarily to higher average interest rates earned on invested cash balances combined with a million decrease in interest expense due to lower amortized loan fees associated with our revolving credit facility which were partially offset by a million increase in foreign exchange transaction losses 
results for include the impact of a one time million income tax charge associated with the repatriation of million of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of see notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
below is a reconciliation between the amounts as reported on a gaap basis and amounts as adjusted on a non gaap basis to exclude the impact of the million repatriation related tax charge 
this information is provided because management believes that results including this million one time tax charge are not indicative of covance s operational results and  as this non gaap measure is used by management as a basis for evaluating the company s performance  investors understanding of covance s performance is enhanced by such disclosure 
as reported removal of tax charge as adjusted year ended december  taxes on income net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the corresponding period 
the basis point increase in covance s effective tax rate is due to the one time million income tax charge associated with the repatriation of million of accumulated foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act 
taxes on income of million would have been million  or million lower  excluding this one time tax charge  and the effective tax rate of would have been or basis points lower than the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to a number of factors  including the mix of our pre tax earnings across various tax jurisdictions  research and development tax credits in the united kingdom  and other planning initiatives 
covance has a minority equity position approximately at december  in bio imaging technologies  inc biti 
biti uses proprietary medical imaging technologies to process and analyze medical images  and also provides other services  including the data basing and regulatory submission of medical images  quantitative data and text 
during the years ended december  and  covance recognized a loss of million and income of million  respectively  representing its pro rata share of biti s earnings losses 
covance has a minority equity position in noveprim limited  an existing supplier of research products 
covance began recognizing earnings from this investment in the second quarter of during the years ended december  and  covance recognized million and million  respectively  representing its share of noveprim s earnings  less the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from noveprim limited and still on hand at covance at december  and net income of million for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to million for the corresponding period 
excluding the one time million income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act  net income would have been million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the corresponding period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenues increased to billion for from million for excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  net revenues increased as compared to net revenues from covance s early development segment grew  or excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods  on strong performance in our global toxicology  chemistry and north american clinical pharmacology services 
net revenues from covance s late stage development segment increased due entirely to the impact of foreign exchange rate variances between both periods 
while the late stage development segment experienced a return to growth in the second half of  especially during the fourth quarter  growth in our late stage development segment was negatively impacted during the first half of by reduced testing volumes in our central laboratory service offering due to low order volumes in the first half of cost of revenue increased to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
gross margins improved basis points to for the year ended december  from for the corresponding period  on a combination of process improvements  cost controls and a shift in mix to higher margin services 
overall  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses was for both and depreciation and amortization increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for income from operations increased to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period 
income from operations from covance s early development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for the year ended december  from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by strong performance in our global toxicology  chemistry  and north american clinical pharmacology services 
income from operations from covance s late stage development segment increased million or to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the corresponding period  primarily driven by stronger performances in our periapproval  cardiac safety and clinical services 
corporate expense increased million to million or of net revenues for from million or of net revenues for the increase is primarily attributable to increased centralized information technology costs and increased spending in sales and marketing  finance  legal and resource management 
other income  net of million for increased million compared to a net expense of million for this increase is the result of a million increase in net interest income due primarily to higher average invested cash balances 
covance s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the corresponding period 
the basis point reduction in covance s effective tax rate during is attributable to a number of factors  including the mix of our pre tax earnings across various tax jurisdictions  higher research and development tax credits in the united kingdom  and other initiatives 
covance has a minority equity position approximately at december  in bio imaging technologies  inc biti 
biti uses proprietary medical imaging technologies to process and analyze medical images  and also provides other services  including the data basing and regulatory submission of medical images  quantitative data and text 
during both of the years ended december  and  covance recognized income of million  representing its pro rata share of biti s earnings 
in march  covance acquired a minority equity position in noveprim limited  an existing supplier of research products 
covance began recognizing earnings from this investment in the second quarter of for the year ended december   covance recognized million  representing its share of noveprim s earnings  less the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from noveprim limited and still on hand at covance at december  net income of million for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to million for the corresponding period 
quarterly results covance s quarterly operating results are subject to variation  and are expected to continue to be subject to variation  as a result of factors such as delays in initiating or completing significant drug development trials  termination or reduction in size of drug development trials  acquisitions and divestitures  changes in the mix of our services  and exchange rate fluctuations 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by covance s customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by covance 
since a large amount of covance s operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  moderate variations in the commencement  progress or completion of drug development trials may cause significant variations in quarterly results 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly operating results of covance for each of the eight most recent fiscal quarters during the period ended december  in the opinion of covance  the information in the table below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results of operations for those periods

liquidity and capital resources covance has a centralized cash management function 
in the united states  cash received from operations is swept daily to a centrally managed concentration account  while cash disbursements for operations are funded as needed from the concentration account 
excess cash balances are invested in high quality money market funds of short duration 
outside of the united states  cash balances are generally pooled by currency in order to facilitate cash management and improve investment returns 
as in the united states  cash balances are generally maintained in the functional currency of the operating unit 
covance s expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible future acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes  including possible share repurchases 
covance s million revolving credit facility the credit facility expires in june and may be expanded to million at covance s election 
covance believes cash from operations will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 
interest on all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus a basis point margin 
costs associated with the credit facility consisted primarily of bank fees totaling million which are being amortized over the five year facility term 
the credit facility contains various financial and other covenants 
at december   covance was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
the credit facility is collateralized by guarantees of certain of covance s domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of percent of the capital stock of certain of covance s foreign subsidiaries 
a commitment fee of basis points on the undrawn balance of the credit facility is payable in arrears on the first day of each july  october  january and april  and totaled approximately million during each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
as discussed in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  and as set forth in the table below  covance is obligated under non cancelable operating leases  primarily for its offices and laboratory facilities 
covance is also obligated under outsourcing agreements related to certain aspects of its information technology and human resources support functions and purchase commitments related to the completion of ongoing facility expansions  both of which are reflected under the caption purchase obligations in the table below 
actual amounts paid under these outsourcing agreements could be higher or lower than the amounts shown below as a result of changes in volume and other variables 
in addition  early termination of these outsourcing agreements by covance could result in the payment of termination fees which are not reflected in the table below 
payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands operating leases     purchase obligations total during the year ended december   covance s operations provided net cash of million  an increase of million from the corresponding period 
the change in net operating assets used million in cash during  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services  partially offset by increases in income taxes payable  accrued liabilities and unearned revenue  while this net change used million in cash during  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services  partially offset by increases in income taxes payable and accrued liabilities 
covance s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  and at december  investing activities for the year ended december  used million compared to using million for the corresponding period 
capital spending for totaled million  and was primarily for the expansion of our madison  wi and harrogate  uk facilities  outfitting of new facilities  purchase of new equipment and upgrade of existing equipment and software for newly hired employees 
acquisition of businesses used million during in june  covance acquired the business of an antibody products provider for a cash payment of million 
in august  covance acquired an bed clinical pharmacology business for cash payments totaling million 
capital spending for the corresponding period totaled million  and included expansion and outfitting of new facilities  purchase of new equipment and upgrade of existing equipment and software for newly hired employees 
investing activities for the year ended december  also included a equity investment in noveprim limited totaling million 
this investment was made in march financing activities for the year ended december  used million and consisted primarily of the purchase into treasury of  shares of common stock in connection with two separate million share buyback programs authorized by covance s board of directors in february and june  and the purchase into treasury of  shares in connection with employee benefit plans  for an aggregate cost of million 
the cost of these share repurchases was partially offset by cash received from stock option exercises and employee contributions to covance s non compensatory employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
financing activities for the year ended december  used million and consisted primarily of the purchase into treasury of  shares of common stock in connection with two separate million share buyback programs authorized by covance s board of directors in february and june  and the purchase into treasury of  shares in connection with employee benefit plans  for an aggregate cost of million 
the cost of these share repurchases was partially offset by cash received from stock option exercises and employee contributions to covance s non compensatory employee stock purchase plan totaling million 
at december   there are approximately million shares remaining for repurchase under the board authorized buyback program 
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash for the year ended december  was a reduction of million versus a million increase for the prior year 
covance s cash balances decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  inflation while most of covance s net revenues are earned under contracts  the long term contracts those in excess of one year generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  covance believes that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material effect on its operations or financial condition
