table of contents overview the company is a provider of cable television and internet access services in moscow  russia 
our wholly owned subsidiary  which markets our services under the brand name akado  is an early stage  growing company 
in recent years we have expanded our ownership base and financial resources to acquire and fund akado s operations 
this includes obtaining a million debt and equity financing package with renova media in january pursuant to which we issued  shares of our newly authorized series b preferred stock and entered into the rm term loan  a million five year term loan agreement 
during  we received million under this arrangement  and during the first quarter of  we received the final million of the debt portion of this arrangement 
during  we generated  of revenues and reported a net loss of  in addition  we have recorded a non cash charge to accumulated deficit of  relating to the beneficial conversion feature of the series b preferred stock issued to renova media due to its issue price being less than the market value of the company s common stock  into which the series b preferred stock converts on a share for share basis 
this has been factored in the calculation of our loss per share  which was per share  basic and diluted 
the beneficial conversion feature charge comprises approximately per share of the reported loss per share 
the series b preferred stock is convertible into our common stock on a share for share basis  has no rights to dividend payments  and carries a liquidation preference through january  due to the fact that we incurred a loss in  the assumed conversion of the series b preferred stock has been excluded from the calculation of our loss per share because such assumed conversion would have an anti dilutive effect 
had such series b preferred stock been included in the calculation  our loss per share for would have been reduced from to 
furthermore  if the non cash beneficial conversion feature charge was also excluded  the net loss per share on the larger share base would have been 
we have incurred losses in recent years and the expansion of our business activities requires a significant amount of capital to meet our cash flow requirements 
although we seek to raise an adequate amount of funds from bank financing  a private placement of debt or equity securities or from a public offering of its securities  there can be no assurance as to our ability to be successful in these efforts 
we have received the commitment from renova media that it will provide us with sufficient capital  either debt or equity  on terms renova media deems satisfactory  to ensure that our operations will continue uninterrupted for a period not less than one year from the date of the filing of this form k for the year ended december  renova media is controlled by victor vekselberg and is primarily a holding company which holds  among other investments  shares of the company s series b preferred stock and warrants 
this commitment has been further supported with million of escrowed funds from renova us holdings  an affiliate of renova media  if we require such escrowed funds  it will be drawn in the form of an month convertible note with warrant coverage based on the market price of our common stock on the date we receive any funds 
additionally  the company s board of directors have instructed management  that if commitments of new capital either equity financing and or long term debt  are not obtained by april   to halt further commitments of expenditures on the buildout of the network  and to conduct our business activities in a manner that will enable our operations to continue uninterrupted with existing cash resources until we have secured additional financing arrangements 
the company has prepared cash flow projections under this assumption and estimates that its existing cash and cash flows will be sufficient to fund the company s activities at least through one year from the date of our filing of this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets including goodwill  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is primarily derived from the sale of cable television and internet services to subscribers 
all revenues are recorded net of vat only when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
customer arrangements for cable television or internet services typically include a connection fee  required equipment rental  as well as a monthly service fee 
we consider the various elements of these arrangements to be part of one bundled service offering to our customers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies  we immediately recognize connection fee revenues to the extent of direct selling costs incurred  which are immediately recognized in full 
connection revenues in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and recognized over the estimated customer relationship period 
revenues related to the rental of set top boxes and modems are recognized ratably over the rental period 
labor and material costs related to connection fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period 
in the event we believe the customer service offering has not yet demonstrated profitability  the costs deferred at the time of connection are immediately expensed and subsequent service revenue and costs are recognized as earned 
at present  we have determined that our internet access services are profitable  but our delivery of cable television and terrestrial television services has not yet demonstrated profitability 

table of contents doubtful accounts we have established allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from our customers 
such estimates are based on our historical write off experience  the aging of receivable balances and changes in customer payment terms 
inventory and construction in process we have established allowances for the estimated losses resulting from our inability to fully utilize certain elements of inventory and construction materials due to obsolescence or our inability to utilize excess quantities 
such allowances are based on historical movement and our estimates of realization 
capitalization of internal costs into construction 
we capitalize labor  overhead and interest costs into the value of the construction of our network  and in doing so  we rely on estimates and allocations that we believe are reasonable 
prepaid pension expense we account for our defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension plans  which provides for the delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses that arise from differences between actual results of the plan from the actuarially calculated results based on several factors including employee mortality and turnover  investment return on plan assets and the discount rates used to record the present value of the obligations of the plan 
to the extent that unrecognized gains or losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market value of its assets  such excess is amortized over the estimated remaining service period of active employees 
however  as a result of the planned termination of substantially all us based employees  in future accounting periods such excess unrecognized actuarial losses may instead be recognized over the estimated lives of all plan participants 
we consider and adjust the various assumptions utilized in the calculations such as the discount rate  future compensation growth rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets  as market conditions warrant 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets such as property  plant  and equipment and acquisition related intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets we intend to hold for use  if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
we consider a number of factors when estimating expected future undiscounted cash flows  including the intended use of the assets and the expected cash flows resulting directly from such use  specific economic conditions  changes in technology and industry conditions 
the assumptions used when estimating the undiscounted cash flows could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives of property  plant  and equipment based on changes in technology  current business developments  and other industry conditions 
although we have not recognized any impairment of our long lived assets  it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of these factors or from actual results which differ from our underlying assumptions 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an impairment test of goodwill annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our business enterprise below its carrying value 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our overall business enterprise 
we believe the market value of the company is the best technique with which to estimate the fair value of our business enterprise 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
when the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated recoverable amounts is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations year ended december  vs year ended december  unaudited the following analysis of the results of operations for the year ended december  is being made in comparison to the unaudited results of operations of the year ended december  during  we changed our fiscal year from a february month end to a december year end 
accordingly  our reported results for the period ended december  are for the ten month 
table of contents transition period then ended 
however  as presented in note to our financial statements as reported under item  we have prepared comparative statements for the year ended december  such unaudited amounts have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with past and present practice 
during  the company increased its sales by  or  of which  of the increase relates to increases from recurring service revenues from subscribers for our internet and television services 
during  we expanded the reach of our homes passed hfc network in moscow by to a total of  homes and businesses 
by the end of february  we further increased our presence by adding an additional  homes to our network 
despite the growth in customers and revenues  we continue to incur operating losses 
during we increased our administrative infrastructure  our sales and marketing efforts and we began incurring interest charges relating to the debt incurred on the renova media financing 
the cost of acquiring new customers for our services also contributed to our increasing our reported losses  as we generally subsidize the installation costs and subscriber equipment and we absorb the direct sales costs of such new customers 
however  we believe that continued growth of our network and our customer base will lead to revenue increases that will narrow the level of operating losses by the end of amounts in thousands percent change unaudited television services internet access services connection fees and equipment sales subscription revenue  connections fees and equipment sales other revenue total revenue cost of sales gross margin subscription revenue  connection fees and equipment sales television service revenues increased by over this growth is comprised of a increase in revenues for the delivery of terrestrial or broadcasting television and radio to our customers  and a increase in revenues from the delivery of pay tv services 
the company s focus on the low revenue per subscriber terrestrial services was deemphasized in  as we focused on promoting our premium television services  particularly following the launch of our digital platform in the latter part of our third quarter 
after approximately six months of our not selling these premium services  while we awaited the delivery of digital set top boxes that are compatible with our new platform  we increased our active subscriber levels for these premium tv services by from  as of december  to  as of december  this represents an increase in the penetration of our homes passed during the year from to 
however  much of the growth of our homes passed network increased during the fourth quarter  and thus we had limited opportunity to increase our subscriber growth in those areas to be able to demonstrate progress in attracting new customers 
within the regions we served as of december   our market penetration levels for pay tv services ranged as high as  as compared to at which time no area had a market penetration for these services in excess of 
growth in revenues from pay tv services was also realized from increases in the subscriptions for content from ntv plus which we carry under an exclusive arrangement for our delivery of their proprietary sports  movies and children s programming content 
revenues from ntv plus content increased by and represented of pay tv revenue in as compared to just of such revenue in although revenues from subscriptions for ntv plus content increased during  the average revenue per subscriber arpu for our pay tv services on a combined basis declined from in to in  due to increased sales promotions and increased bundling of our television services with our internet access offerings 
internet access revenues increased by over  as a result of an increase of in the number of our active subscribers  from  at december  to  as of december  this represents an increase in our market penetration from to 
however  market penetration levels ranged as high as in defined areas as of december   while a year earlier  no single area had market penetration in excess of 
our monthly arpu for internet access services decreased from approximately to 
arpu in the fourth quarter of averaged approximately per active subscriber 
increased competition has led to the lowering of our tariff structure and sales promotional discounts have resulted in revenues that are initially reduced for new subscribers 
connection fees and equipment sales grew from  to  primarily as a result of the increased level of new customers which we have attained through the expansion of the territory to which we can market  and through more active marketing campaigns 
such revenues increased as we recognize such revenues to the extent of direct selling costs and we amortize the excess of such revenue over the subscribers estimated lives 

table of contents other revenue other revenue declined by to  primarily due to the non recurrence of construction subcontracting revenue received in the first quarter of for a project being managed by comcor 
cost of sales cost of sales increased by  or  as compared to the increase in revenues 
this served to increase gross margins to  or of sales as compared to the gross margins of  or of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased from to primarily as a result of depreciation and amortization which contributed to the margin improvement due to a large fixed amortization of licenses component within this caption 
in addition  secondary node costs increased at a rate greater than sales 
while depreciation and amortization was lower due to a large fixed component within this caption 
significant components of cost of sales were as follows in thousands amount percent of sales amount percent of sales services from related party depreciation and amortization all other  including salaries and benefits total the cost of services from comcor increased by in as compared to  primarily as a result of the expansion of the number of secondary nodes which we use  which serves as the basis for charges for signal delivery for our television and other services through comcor s fiber optic network  and from increases in the rates for the lease of these secondary nodes as a result of amendments to our contract with comcor which was entered into in march as a result  this component of the charges from comcor increased by from levels 
at december   we were leasing secondary nodes  as compared to as of december   which is an increase of 
in addition  the cost of secondary nodes increased from per month per secondary node to a range of to  depending on the number of homes connected to each node 
in addition  we did not receive the benefit of a three month grace period from the time of the installation of the secondary nodes as a result of the change in the contract 
comcor also provides us with the lease of ports and channels in connection with our internet services  for which the overall charge increased by only despite significant growth in our business  as a result of the lower rates negotiated with comcor 
in addition  the charges include  of costs for internet traffic services provided by comcor beginning in march prior to that time  these services were provided by an outside vendor  but we were able to negotiate lower prices as a result of the new agreement with comcor 
other cost of sales was also impacted in by the recognition of  of obsolescence relating to inventory and construction materials  and increased connection and installation costs due to increased number of new subscriber installations 
operating expenses operating expenses totaled  during  which is an increase of over the expenses totaling  which were incurred during the twelve month period ended december  increases in our salary and benefit costs totaling  accounted for of the total increase as such costs increased by year over year 
the addition of a four person management coincident with the closing of renova media financing  subsequent severance and termination costs for the members of this team  the costs of successor executives and the accrual of severance costs for certain us based employees contributed to the increased salary costs 
within these increased costs were  of severance costs and  relating to the grant of in the money stock options and the cashless exercise of a portion of such options 
in addition  with the growth of our activities  our employment levels increased to staff sales  marketing and customer care positions to ensure our ability to properly manage the increased customer activity 
other costs increased due to additional marketing activities which increased our advertising by  over the prior year  the expansion of our space and office costs which increased our facilities and office expenses by  increased fees associated with higher volumes of cash transactions with our customers by  and an increase of  in our insurance costs primarily due to expanded directors and officers liability insurance coverage 
equity in losses of ias for  the company has recorded an expense of  as its equity in the losses of ias 
this amount includes an adjustment to reflect the company s equity interest in the fair value of depreciation expense based on the allocation of the purchase price attributable to the company s investment in ias 

table of contents investment income and other income significant components of investment income and other income are as follows in thousands unaudited net gains from domestic trading portfolio rental income interest and dividends change in deferred compensation accounts ultrasonics royalties precious metal recovery and other total rental income relates to the lease of our bloomfield  connecticut property  which is being leased to the purchaser of our former manufacturing company and from which such purchaser is conducting its operations 
interest and dividends increased primarily from the investment of the portion of the proceeds from the renova media financing that had not yet been used to support operations during the year 
the precious metals recovery in relates to our former manufacturing company which was sold in march  and the ultrasonics royalties represent the completion of payments received pursuant to the sale of separate operations and technologies in february interest expense for  interest expense totaled  as compared to  for the amount excludes  of interest charges that were capitalized into cost of the company s last mile access network 
no such interest costs were capitalized in the increase in the interest cost is due to the draw down of million under the rm term loan in january  and the effects of quarterly compounding of accrued interest into the principal of this note 
the company reduced it outstanding obligation due under its subordinated debenture through its annual principal payment  and also reduced the amount due under a mortgage loan 
subsequent to december   we received an additional million in proceeds under the rm term loan which in addition to the effect of compounding the interest costs of this loan into the principal balance  is expected to further increase our interest costs in in march  we also refinanced a mortgage loan which increased the principal balance by approximately million 
income tax benefit the estimated effective tax benefit rate of for is lower than average effective tax benefit rate of for primarily due to the increases in deferred income tax liabilities associated with certain of the company s long lived assets and our inability to record tax benefits associated with a larger loss 
these factors were partially offset by a  reversal of earlier current tax accruals relating to a favorable ruling relating to a pennsylvania state tax matter 
we recorded deferred tax benefits in both and from the amortization of deferred tax liabilities that had been established in connection with the recording of certain intangible assets and we recorded deferred tax liabilities relating to timing differences between book and tax reporting of certain assets 
we do not record the income tax benefits relating to current operating losses until we can be certain of our ability to realize such benefits

table of contents while the results for tp included just the company s indirect interest in cctv s results arising from the company s use of the equity method of accounting for its investment in mbc  which in turn recorded its equity in cctv s losses 
the inclusion of twelve months of cctv s results in tp has been made to allow the company to transition from reporting cctv s and mbc s results of operations and financial condition on a two month lag basis to a simultaneous basis as part of the company s change in fiscal years 
in addition to cctv s operating progress  the effects of purchase accounting have generally resulted in lower amounts of depreciation and amortization in tp than had been reported by cctv for due to the fact that the carrying value of cctv s assets was reduced based on the allocation of the purchase price to their fair values at the date of acquisition in february the per share results in tp reflect the increase in the company s weighted average outstanding shares  primarily as the result of the shares of common stock issued in february and september in connection with the acquisitions of cctv and mbc

increases in advertising and marketing costs  property taxes  professional fees  and wages and benefits all contributed to the overall increase in the customer base and growth in the business 
cctv s equity in losses of ias during  cctv recorded its equity in ias s losses for the entire year as compared to just five months of such equity in losses during  which accounted for a substantial portion of the increase from  in fy to  for fy for the year ended december   ias incurred a net loss of  as compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  during  ias incurred  of foreign currency translation losses and in it recorded dividends and gains totaling  from the sale of an investment

the current year benefit reflects limitations of the company s ability to carry back operating losses and the provision for valuation allowances relating to the company s ability to realize benefits from its corporate level losses and its equity in the losses of mbc 
preferred dividends dividends on the company s series a preferred stock  which are paid at the annual rate of per outstanding share  totaled  in each of fy and fy  as there were no changes in the number of outstanding shares of series a preferred stock during these periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our consolidated cash totaled  as compared to  at december  during  we used  of cash in our operating activities as cash operating losses totaled  and changes in operating assets used an additional  of funds 
increases in inventories and value added taxes recoverable were among the larger components of the use of working capital during the year 
we generally assess our liquidity by evaluating the combination of cash and short term 
table of contents investments  since the major portion of our short term investments  as of december were invested in auction rate securities which are highly liquid instruments 
thus  our consolidated resources at december  totaled  however  as noted below  and as indicated from the uses of cash for operations and capital expenditures in  we expect to require additional capital in  in addition to the million we received from renova media in the first quarter  to meet our business plans for and going forward 
during  we used  of cash in investing activities which was comprised of net investment of  in marketable securities and  of capital expenditures  primarily relating to the expansion of akado s hfc network  which increased from  homes passed as of december  to  homes passed at december   and to increases in expenditures for future build out 
financing activities provided  to us during we received a net of  from renova media s investment in our series b preferred stock and from the proceeds of the rm term loan  after deducting costs of the financing transaction and the repayment of a million bridge loan that had been extended by renova media in in addition  in accordance with terms of the rm term loan  we financed  of interest on the rm term loan by rolling it into the principal of the loan 
we also used  to complete the purchase of additional shares of ias 
this purchase was initiated in to enable us to maintain our equity interest in ias 
we have incurred operating losses and we expect that such losses will continue in and possibly beyond 
our current marketing efforts involve significant subsidies of the installation costs  including subscriber equipment for new customers 
these costs have the effect of increasing both recognized and deferred expenses that generally exceed the revenues to be received by the subscribers for several months  if at all 
accordingly  we are dependent upon subscriber retention to ensure that the aggregate growth in subscriber revenues exceeds these incremental costs as well as other incremental operating costs 
we have used cash to fund our operating losses and the construction of our hfc network since inception and we remain dependent upon external financing to continue these activities 
in the first quarter of  we have continued the expansion of our hfc network 
in addition  we have also continued to invest in the growth of our subscriber base  which require funds to pay for both current and deferred installation and equipment costs  and thus  contribute to a continuing requirement for funds 
during the first quarter of we received million from renova media under the rm term loan  and we also received a commitment from renova media to provide us with sufficient capital  either debt or equity  on terms renova media deems satisfactory  to ensure that our operations will continue uninterrupted for a period of no less than one year from the date of our filing this annual report 
renova media is controlled by victor vekselberg and is primarily a holding company which holds  among other investments  share of the company s series b preferred stock and warrants 
should we require this additional funding  we do not know the terms on which renova media will offer the funding  or the resulting impact of such terms on the share price of our common stock  or our ability to secure funding from other parties 
this commitment has been further supported with a guarantee and million of escrowed funds from renova us holdings  an affiliate of renova media 
if we require such escrowed funds  they will be drawn in the form of an month convertible note with warrant coverage based on the market price of our common stock on the date we receive any funds 
further  we cannot give any assurance that the funding provided by renova media to date  or that which may be provided in the future  will be sufficient to enable us to continue the construction of the hfc network to cover a sufficiently desirable portion of moscow  or to otherwise position us to attract adequate subscriptions to increase recurring revenues with the goal of achieving profitability and positive cash flows 
although we seek to raise an adequate amount of funds from bank financing  a private placement of debt or equity securities or from a public offering of our securities  there can be no assurance as to our ability to be successful in these efforts  or the terms of such funding if we are successful 
additionally  the company s board of directors has instructed management  that if commitments of new capital either equity financing and or long term debt  are not obtained by april   to halt further commitments of expenditures on the buildout of the network and to conduct our business activities in a manner that will enable our operations to continue uninterrupted with existing cash resources until we have secured additional financing arrangements 
the company has prepared cash flow projections under this assumption and estimates that its existing cash resources and cash flows will be sufficient to fund the company s activities at least through one year from the date of our filing of this form k 
the rm term loan bears interest at the annual rate of which has increased our interest costs from historical levels and is likely to increase due to additional amounts being drawn and the compounding effect of rolling accrued interest into the principal balance of the note 
the company has the option to pay the interest quarterly  or to roll interest into the principal of the rm term loan at which time  such capitalized amount also accrues interest expense 
if the company elects to pay the interest currently as it comes due  such use of cash may restrict its ability to fully implement the business expansion plans for akado in moscow 
if the interest is capitalized into the principal of the rm term loan as was done in  the compound growth in the expense and the liability could hamper the company s ability to attract additional future financing or to justify meaningful value for the company s equity securities and could present a significant cash flow obligation at the maturity of the rm term loan in january the rm term loan also involved pledges of substantially all of the company s and akado s assets  including but not limited to fixed assets  securities  the shares of all significant subsidiaries and all future revenue 
these terms may limit our ability to obtain bank loans or other financing in the future 

table of contents prior to january  the rm term loan contained a requirement for us to have passed  homes with our hfc network prior to being able to draw the final million of this loan facility 
to enable us to draw the million in the first quarter of  this provision was waived  along with a fee that would have otherwise been due upon the draw down in exchange for our agreement to extend by nine months to october  the life of the warrants to purchase  shares of series b preferred stock 
due to the extension of the term of the warrant given to renova media in connection with the financing  any funds that may be made available from the exercise of the warrant might not be received until october  which is nine months after the maturity of the rm term loan 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist of purchase commitments and operating lease commitments as disclosed in the contractual obligations table below 
our defined benefit pension plan is required to make benefit payments totaling  in   in   in   in   in and  during the five year period from to as of december   we do not expect to have to make any contributions to fund the obligations of our defined benefit pension plan 
at december   the recorded value of the prepaid expense relating to this plan was  which represents an increase of  over the prior year s amount 
under the actuarial calculations  the plan is overfunded by  which is an increase of  from the prior year 
in accordance with sfas  we have not recognized net actuarial losses totaling  which represents a decline from  from the prior year primarily due to favorable investment returns from the plan s assets in such losses had arisen primarily from reductions in the actuarially assumed discount rate to value the plan s obligations in prior years 
based upon recent trends  we do not expect that the discount rate used of will go much lower 
the lower level of unrecognized losses is expected to result in reduced levels of amortization of such unrecognized losses into pension expense 
such unrecognized losses are amortized over the expected services lives of covered employees 
the company expects that all such covered employees may terminate employment with the company in  which would result in the excess portion of the unrecognized loss being recognized over the lives of the plan s participants  which may further reduce this expense component of pension income in and beyond 
the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases severance costs purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations these obligations exclude the effects of the increased obligation relating to the additional million draw down on the rm term loan which occurred in the first quarter of  and the refinancing of the mortgage loan in march the company s capital expenditures  including  of unpaid capitalized interest  for the year ended december  are summarized as follows in thousands q q q q total line extensions network costs associated with entering new service areas scalable infrastructure primarily internet equipment and digital television platform other administrative recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 

table of contents sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company expects to adopt the modified prospective method effective january  based upon the number of unvested options outstanding as of december   the company expects to record compensation expense of  in as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
the actual effects could vary significantly from these estimates based upon additional share based payments granted in the future  and the actual vesting of currently outstanding stock options 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method 
during  the company recorded expenses totalling  relating to in the money stock options 
had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the accounting pronouncement would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings contained in note sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s reported net operating cash flows or our net financing cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and waste materials are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas in is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and  accordingly  is required to be adopted by the company on january  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and from factors that impact equity and operational investments in russia 
foreign investment and currency risk since the company s wholly owned subsidiary  akado  operates in russia  the company is subject to the economic and political risks associated with operating in russia 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the russian ruble may affect the reporting of the company s results of operation and financial condition in terms of us dollars 
akado s current pricing strategies involve monthly tariffs that are closely tied to the value of the us dollar but which are still invoiced and paid in russian rubles 
this could result in fluctuations in revenues that are not met equally or proportionally with changes in the company s expenses 
furthermore  certain of akado s financial statements are us dollar based  including  but not limited to  notes payable to affiliates  interest expense and certain of its customer equipment and construction costs 
accordingly  the company is exposed to the economic risks associated with an entity which conducts its business in more than one currency  and the financial reporting risks that accompany the judgments involved in determining the functional currency and the potential impacts that such determinations may have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge its foreign currency exchange risks 

table of contents operating akado also involves the risk of akado s ability to increase its revenues through the addition of subscribers for its cable television  high speed data transmission and internet services 
the subscriber growth is largely dependent upon akado s ability to build out its hfc network from the mfon which it leases from comcor  which is largely dependent upon it receiving a sufficient amount of capital to pay for the equipment and construction costs  and also through increasing penetration in areas already built 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s debt obligations  including the rm term loan and the subordinated debenture carry a fixed rate of interest 
however  at december   the company had a mortgage loan payable with a remaining principal balance of  which bore interest at the rate of  which was based on the libor rate in effect at the origination of the loan 
in march  this loan was refinanced and the balance increased to  the revised term calls for a fixed rate of interest at
