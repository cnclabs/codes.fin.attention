item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to monitor federal and state legislative and regulatory issues involving consumer data privacy and protection 
much of this activity resulted from highly publicized third party security breaches in early involving personal financial data 
while numerous bills have been introduced and a few have become law at the state level  governing matters such as the right of consumers to freeze the credit files maintained by credit reporting agencies under certain circumstances and security breach notification provisions  these have not resulted in significant changes to our business practices 
we expect to see an increase in the number of notices resulting from breached third party databases and the number of consumers that contact credit reporting companies following a breach 
at the federal level  congress has held hearings and drafted various bills dealing with data security and identity theft issues 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these bills in and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fcra  as amended in  contains a number of significant identity theft protections for consumers and we continue to work with regulators to fully implement all of its provisions 
we are also subject to privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in foreign countries where we do business  including the european union s privacy directive 
the uk s data protection act of regulates the manner in which we can use third party data 
recent regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll  one of our key data sources in the uk generally  the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines  excluding our commercial services products  are subject to these regulations 
the information underlying our us commercial services and direct marketing services business is less regulated than the other portions of our business 
a significant portion of the information maintained by our marketing services business is voluntarily provided by individuals  rendering it subject to fewer restrictions on use 
it is our policy  however  to treat all information with a high degree of security reflecting our recognition of individuals privacy concerns 
intellectual property we generally seek protection under federal  state and foreign laws for strategic or financially important intellectual property developed in connection with our business 
certain intellectual property  where appropriate  is protected by contracts  licenses  registrations  confidentiality or other agreements or protections 
we own several patents registered in the us and certain foreign countries  the more important of which cover various aspects of and relate to the use of data within a consumer credit file 
we also have certain registered trademarks in the us and in many foreign countries 
the most important of these is equifax and many variations thereof 
these marks are used in connection with most of our product lines and services 
although these patents and trademarks are important and valuable assets in the aggregate  no single patent  group of patents or trademark is critical to the success of our business 
we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations 
we license other companies to use certain data  technology and other intellectual property rights we own or control  primarily as core components of our products and services  on terms that are consistent with customary industry standards 
we are licensed by others to use certain data  technology and other intellectual property rights they own or control  none of which is material to our business except for licenses from fair isaac corporation  relating to certain credit scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived there from  which licenses have varying durations and generally provide for usage based fees  and seisint  inc  relating to a software platform which facilitates sales by our direct marketing services and credit marketing services units  which licenses have ten year terms beginning in and may be renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
competition we operate in a number of geographic  product and service markets  which are highly competitive 
our information services products primarily compete with the products of two global consumer credit reporting companies  experian and transunion  which offer a range of consumer credit reporting products that are similar to products we offer 
we believe that our products and services offer customers an advantage over those of our competitors because of the quality of our data files  which we believe to be superior in terms of depth and accuracy 
our competitive strategy is to rely on product features and quality while remaining competitive on price 
experian and dun bradstreet  inc are the major competitors for our commercial services products  although we believe we have a unique database and product for the small business segment of that market 
our marketing services products also compete with these companies and others who offer demographic information products and services  including acxiom corporation  harte hanks  inc and infousa  inc we believe the marketing services products and services are superior and  in some cases unique compared to those offered by our competitors at comparable prices 
our personal solutions products and services compete with similar offerings sold directly by experian and transunion and also with offerings from a number of resellers of consumer credit information sold by experian  transunion and us 
we tailor our pricing of personal solutions products to the needs of the market  which can change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the consumer market 
we change our pricing periodically to accommodate new product introductions  or other market conditions 
employees we employed approximately  employees in countries as of january  the north america segment employed approximately  of these employees  europe employed approximately  latin america employed approximately and general corporate employed approximately none of our us employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and no work stoppages have been experienced 
pursuant to local laws  our employees in brazil  spain and argentina are subject to collective bargaining agreements that govern general salary and compensation matters  basic benefits and hours of work
