item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview supervalu is one of the largest grocery companies in the united states 
we operate in two segments of the grocery industry  retail food stores and supply chain services  which includes food distribution and related logistics support services 
at february   we conducted our retail operations through a total of  stores of which are licensed locations 
store counts are adjusted for the planned sale of deals and shop n save pittsburgh 
principal formats include extreme value stores  regional price superstores and regional supermarkets 
our supply chain services operations network spans states and we serve as primary grocery supplier to approximately  stores  in addition to our own regional banner store network  as well as serving as secondary grocery supplier to approximately stores 
based on revenues for fiscal  we would be ranked as the largest extreme value food retailer  ninth largest grocery retailer  and largest public company food wholesaler in the united states 
on january   supervalu announced that supervalu  cvs corporation cvs and an investment group led by cerberus capital management  lp the cerberus group had reached definitive agreements to acquire albertson s  inc albertsons 
each albertsons stockholder will ultimately be entitled to receive in cash and shares of supervalu common stock for each share of albertsons common stock that they held before the transaction 
pursuant to those agreements  supervalu will acquire the operations of acme markets  bristol farms  jewel osco  shaw s supermarkets  star markets  and the albertsons banner stores in the intermountain  northwest and southern california regions  and the related in store pharmacies under the osco and save on banners  for a total of approximately  stores the proposed transaction 
the total consideration to be paid by supervalu is approximately billion based on a average stock price using the day trading average of the closing price of supervalu stock through january  including approximately billion in cash and billion in stock and the assumption of approximately billion of albertsons debt 
following the proposed transaction  which is expected to close during june  approximately percent of supervalu will be held by existing supervalu stockholders and approximately percent will be held by former albertsons stockholders  on a fully diluted basis  including the early settlement of the albertsons percent mandatory convertible securities 
the new supervalu will have approximately million fully diluted common shares outstanding  compared to approximately million fully diluted shares outstanding as of february  after the proposed transaction  supervalu is expected to have revenues of approximately billion of which approximately will be retail  approximately  employees   owned and licensed stores  in store pharmacies and fuel centers 
the transaction is subject to approval by supervalu stockholders and albertsons stockholders  the contemporaneous closing of the agreements with the cerberus group and cvs  and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions 
on april   the securities and exchange commission sec declared effective the form s joint proxy statement prospectus in connection with the proposed transaction 
the grocery food industry can be characterized as one of consolidation and rationalization  as evidenced by the proposed transaction 
the industry also continues to experience store saturation driven primarily by increases in square footage devoted to food in supercenters  club stores  mass merchandisers  dollar stores  drug stores and other alternate formats as well as organic growth by traditional supermarket operators 
this competition continues to pressure same store sales 
the grocery industry is also affected by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer spending behavior 
we would characterize fiscal as a year with modest economic growth  high fuel price inflation and slightly increased product cost inflation 
for fiscal  we expect consumer spending will again be pressured by higher fuel prices and modest food inflation 
in fiscal  most businesses  including the labor intensive grocery industry  were impacted by another year of rising health care and pension costs 
although the rate of increase moderated in fiscal  these rising costs impacted the overall profitability levels of the food industry and remain a pivotal issue in labor negotiations for unionized employees who bargain for health and retirement benefits in addition to wages 
approximately percent of supervalu s employees are unionized 
we did not experience any strikes during fiscal approximately percent of our unionized workforce is represented by contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal assuming the closing of the proposed transaction  approximately percent of our employees will be unionized and approximately percent of our unionized workforce will be represented by contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal all of these industry factors impact our food distribution customer base 
as a result  we continue to experience customer attrition in our supply chain services operations 
the attrition rate in fiscal was approximately five percent  which is above the historical range of approximately two percent to four percent  due primarily to the impact of cycling of three large customer transactions to other suppliers in the prior year 
all the above factors will continue to impact our industry and our company in fiscal we believe we can be successful against this industry backdrop with our regional retail formats that focus on local execution  merchandising and consumer knowledge 
in addition  our operations will benefit from our efficient and low cost supply chain and economies of scale as we leverage our retail and supply chain services operations 
save a lot  our extreme value format  has nationwide potential  and currently operates in states 
we plan to expand regional retail banner square footage through selective new store growth in key markets where we have significant market share 
the proposed transaction will significantly expand our retail presence and the number of stores we operate 
in addition  we will supplement regional retail store growth with continued focus on remodel activities 
given the life cycle maturity of our supply chain services business with its inherent attrition rate  future growth in food distribution will be modest and primarily achieved through serving new independent customers  net growth from existing customers and further consolidation opportunities

actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowances for losses on receivables management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts and notes receivable portfolios 
in determining the adequacy of the allowances  management analyzes the value of the collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
although risk management practices and methodologies are utilized to determine the adequacy of the allowance  it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted by different judgments as to collectibility based on the information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
lifo and retail inventory method inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is replacement value 
substantially all of the company s inventory is finished goods 
for a significant portion of the company s inventory  cost is determined through use of the last in  first out lifo method 
the company utilized lifo to value approximately percent and percent of the company s consolidated inventories for fiscal and  respectively 
the retail inventory method rim is used to value retail inventory 
the valuation of inventories is at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce results which differ from actual 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date 
reserves for closed properties and asset impairment charges the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to sixteen years 
the company estimates subtenant income and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
owned properties and capital lease properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
reduction in the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
the expectations on timing of disposition or sublease and the estimated sales price or sublease income associated with closed properties are impacted by variable factors such as inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates on closed properties are adequate  it is possible that market conditions in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
reserves for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  health care for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  health care and general and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
a basis point change in discount rates would increase the company s liability by approximately million 
benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other post retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense and obligation in future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially impact non union pension and other post retirement obligations and future expenses 
for fiscal  when not considering other changes in assumptions or impacts from the proposed transaction  the impact to pension expense of each basis point reduction in the discount rate is to increase pension expense by approximately million and the impact of each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets is to increase pension expense by approximately million 
similarly  for post retirement benefits  a one percent change in the health care cost trend rate would impact the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by approximately million and the service and interest cost by million in fiscal the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
goodwill management assesses the valuation of goodwill for each of the company s reporting units on an annual basis through the comparison of the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by the company  which utilize a discounted cash flow methodology 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions
