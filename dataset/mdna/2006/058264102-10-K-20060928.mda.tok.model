item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation dollars in thousands except share and per share data general 
the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain factors  which have affected the consolidated financial statements of baldwin technology company  inc baldwin or the company 
forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the following statements and certain other statements contained herein are based on current expectations 
similarly  the press releases issued by the company and other public statements made by the company from time to time may contain language that is forward looking 
these forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as forecast  believe  expect  intend  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential  among others 
such statements are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in item a risk factors and exhibit to this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  critical accounting policies and estimates baldwin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires baldwin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
baldwin continually evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
baldwin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
baldwin maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of baldwin s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
baldwin provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while baldwin engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  baldwin s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from baldwin s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
baldwin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
baldwin records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
baldwin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event baldwin were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should baldwin determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded through a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates for temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as the effects of net operating losses carried forward in certain tax jurisdictions in which the company operates that may be utilized to offset future taxable income and similar tax credits carried forward that may be utilized to reduce future taxes payable 
the company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets when appropriate to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowances  certain judgments are made by management relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets  use of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
the assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically by management based on current business conditions that affect the company and overall economic conditions 
these management judgments are therefore subject to change based on factors that include  but are not limited to changes in the profitability of the company s subsidiaries as well as for the company as a whole  the ability of the company to successfully execute its tax planning strategies  and the accuracy of the company s estimate of the potential effect that changes in tax legislation  in the jurisdictions where the company operates  may have on the company s future taxable profits 
failure by the company to achieve forecasted taxable income or to execute its tax planning strategies may affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income or successfully execute its tax planning strategies include  but are not limited to  increased competition  general economic conditions  a decline in sales or earnings  loss of market share  delays in product availability or changes in tax legislation 
in addition  baldwin recognizes reserves for contingencies when it becomes probable that such a contingency exists 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually  by determining the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model  and comparing it with its book value 
if  during the annual impairment review  the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
sfas requires management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  as well as the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit  other than goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit  taken as a whole  and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset or a change in business climate 
baldwin calculates estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  of the related operation and compares it to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based upon a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exits 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a related reporting unit may require the company to record an impairment charge in the future 
the impairment review process requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the respective assets 
the key variables that management must estimate in determining these expected future cash flows include sales volumes  sales prices  sales growth  production and operating costs  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  market conditions and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and such estimates are inherently uncertain  however  the assumptions used are reasonable and consistent with the company s internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on conditions that influence these variables 
the assumptions and conditions for determining impairments of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets reflect management s best assumptions and estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties as described above  many of which are not under management s control 
as a result  the accounting for such items could result in different estimates or amounts if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods
