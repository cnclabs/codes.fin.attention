item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see the cautionary statement above 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k  particularly in item a 
under the heading risk factors 
overview general 
we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops  and markets proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits  or ics 
we currently offer products that serve several markets portable multimedia players  notebook and desktop pc audio  consumer audio  multi function peripherals  digital video cameras and usb peripherals 
we made our first commercial shipments of portable multimedia socs for the portable multimedia player market in we made our first commercial shipments of pc audio codecs during during  we also began to sell our audio codecs into the consumer electronics market for products such as dvd players and set top boxes 
we made our first commercial shipments of both multi function peripheral ics and digital video camera ics in the third quarter of as a result of the oasis semiconductor  inc oasis and protocom corporation protocom acquisitions  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
through acquisitions and internal development efforts  we continue to diversify our product offerings 
as we continue to grow our business  we plan to continue to diversify our product offerings by introducing new versions of existing products with additional functionality  and by introducing ics for markets we do not currently serve  thereby expanding our total available market opportunity 
a further description of our products may be found in part i  item i of this report under the heading business 
new product acceptance 
in october of  we introduced our stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs  our newest soc for flash based and hard disk based digital multimedia players 
in november  we introduced our stfm fm tuner companion processor to our stmp xx and xx families of portable multimedia socs that provides the added capability of receiving signals from fm radio stations 
our recent historical revenue growth has been primarily from sales of our stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs  which accounted for and of our revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we introduced the stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs in the fourth quarter of and  despite continued success with stmp xx socs  as those products have matured  their average selling prices have declined  which is typical for the semiconductor industry 
our future success depends on our ability to market and sell the stmp xx soc  the stmp xx soc  the stfm fm tuner  and to develop other successful new products in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce  or that potential customers will be able to implement  new or enhanced products in a timely and cost effective manner or that our new products will generate significant revenues 
competition  average selling prices 
we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors in each of our targeted markets 
the consumer electronics market  which is a principal end market for our ics  has historically been subject to intense price competition 
as a result of this increased competition  we continue to experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to the continued erosion of our average selling prices  particularly for portable multimedia socs 
in the past  we have reduced the average unit price of our products in anticipation of or in response to competitive pricing pressures and new product introductions by us or our competitors 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further decline in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
if we are unable to offset any such reductions in our average selling prices by timely introducing new products and product enhancements  increasing our sales volumes and reducing development costs  our gross profits and revenues will suffer 
growth 
our business has grown rapidly since our inception as a result of acquisitions  the opening of international locations and through hiring  both domestically and internationally  as reflected by our employee 
table of contents 
index to financial statements headcount  which increased to as of december   from employees as of december  we expect that our headcount could increase further  particularly in asia  to support our expected growth 
as a result of our focused development efforts towards portable multimedia socs and audio codecs in early  our annual revenues grew substantially from million in to million in due primarily to increased sales of our portable multimedia socs 
our operating results improved from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in however  we do not expect similar revenue growth or market share gains in future periods 
this expansion  which includes the acquisitions of oasis semiconductor  inc and protocom corporation  has placed  and any future expansion will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources  and has significantly increased our operating expenses 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  develop new products  enhance our technological capabilities  satisfy customer requirements  execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance 
sales channels 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our ics 
we also utilize distributors to sell our products 
our sales through distributors result in lower gross margins 
however  this decrease in gross margins from sales through distributors is partially offset by lower selling expenses than are associated with direct sales to end customers 
in recent periods  we have begun engaging in more direct sales to customers  which generally results in higher gross margins than indirect sales  but also involves increased selling expenses 
as our sales practices continue to evolve towards increased direct sales to end customers  there will be continued fluctuations in our gross margins and operating margins 
significant customers 
a few customers account for a substantial portion of our sales 
the following table sets forth our customers that represented or more of our revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  gmi technology creative technology asustek computer inc holystone enterprise less than creative technology held more than of our outstanding stock during the periods indicated  until october creative also had a representative on our board of directors until his resignation on june  we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenues have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
overseas revenues 
the percentage of our revenues from customers located outside the united states was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
most of the products that use our ics are manufactured outside of the united states 
as a result  we believe that a substantial majority of our revenues will continue to come from customers located outside of the united states 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the percentages of our revenues by country are set forth in the following table year ended december  china hong kong taiwan singapore south korea us japan other total sales cycles 
the length of our sales cycle varies depending on the end application for our product  but our sales cycles are generally lengthy 
the cycle can be as short as several months for some portable socs and as long as months for our multi function peripheral system controller solutions 
volume production of products that use our ics can take an additional to months to be achieved  if at all 
the lengthy sales cycles of our products make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders 
our sales are made by purchase orders  but because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  and order lead times can vary period to period  backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses  adversely affecting our results of operations 
seasonality 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer electronic products  such as portable multimedia players  pcs  and dvd players  we expect our business to be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand  and lower revenues in the first and second quarters of each year 
however  our recent rapid revenue growth makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
in particular  strong sales of our portable multimedia socs resulted in increased revenues during the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  offsetting seasonal demand factors 
seasonal demand factors were also recently offset by the price volatility and availability of other components used to build our customer s devices  namely nand flash memory  as well as high inventory levels of our products at specific customers at the end of the first quarter of international expansion 
in the third quarter of  we established an international subsidiary and opened an office in hong kong 
during  we opened branch offices in taipei  taiwan and shenzhen  china  and established international subsidiaries and opened offices in singapore  seoul  south korea  tokyo  japan  and cambridge  england 
we anticipate that we will continue to increase our employee headcount in our asian offices as our asian operations mature 
recent acquisitions 
on october   we acquired certain assets  intellectual property and engineering resources from the direct digital amplification ddx product line of apogee technology  inc for million in cash 
we also agreed to make an additional payment of up to million in cash pursuant to the terms of an earn out provision based on the achievement by the ddx business of certain revenues during the one year period following the closing 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on september   we acquired oasis semiconductor  inc  a privately held provider of ics for the multi function peripheral market  for million in cash 
we also agreed to make an additional payment of up to million in cash pursuant to the terms of an earn out provision based on the achievement by the oasis business of certain calendar year revenues 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements on august   we completed our acquisition of protocom corporation  a privately held provider of ics to the digital video camera market  for million in cash and million in the form of  shares of sigmatel common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on july   we acquired certain assets  intellectual property and engineering resources associated with the rio portable audio product line from d m holdings  inc for million in cash 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
statement of operations overview the following describes certain line items in our consolidated statement of operations revenues 
revenues consist primarily of sales of our ics  net of sales discounts or incentives 
we recognize revenues on direct sales at the time of shipment to our customers or later if required by shipping terms 
we defer revenues on sales through distributors which have rights of return or price protection until products are resold by such distributors to their customers 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  we have deferred revenue from nonrecurring engineering fees nre 
we defer revenues from nre until the obligations under the nre agreements have been met and the related products are shipping in production quantities 
the main factors that impact our revenues are unit volumes shipped and average selling prices 
overall  we expect average selling prices for our products to decline over time as products mature 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of purchasing silicon wafers  and also includes costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of our ics  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  and occupancy costs 
cost of goods sold also consists of amortization of developed product technology and an intellectual property license agreement purchased through our acquisitions which is generally amortized over not more than six years 
because we do not have long term  fixed price supply contracts  our wafer costs are subject to the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities  contractor fees  expenses for development testing and evaluation  mask costs  occupancy costs  acquired in process research and development see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to in process research and development costs ipr d  and depreciation of research and development equipment 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to meeting the changing requirements of our customers and to our overall long term success 
we expect that research and development expenses could increase in absolute dollars as we employ additional research and development personnel and continue to invest significantly in research and development activities to develop new products to be competitive in the future  although such expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate 
a further description of our research and development efforts may be found in part i  item i of this report under the heading business 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs  occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  amortization of acquired intangible assets and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services  as well as marketing activities 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses could increase in absolute dollars as we expand our business to support our future operations 
we also expect to continue to incur significant litigation expenses in the future as we protect and defend our intellectual property and technology

index to financial statements amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
in connection with grants of stock options and the issuance of warrants as a private company between and  we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation 
these options and warrants are considered compensatory because the fair value of our stock determined for financial reporting purposes was greater than the fair value determined by our board of directors on the date of grant or issuance 
we have also recorded deferred stock based compensation due to the conversion of certain contractors to employees 
in addition  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the unvested portion of stock options assumed in acquisitions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information related to the stock options assumed 
sigmatel accelerated the vesting of approximately million unvested stock options outstanding under sigmatel s equity incentive plan  as amended  to reduce compensation costs that would have been recognized in sigmatel s consolidated financial statements after with the adoption of sfas no 
r by approximately million 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of deferred stock based compensation of which million will be eliminated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to apply certain expense recognition provisions to share based payments to employees using the fair value method 
other income expense 
interest income reflects interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
income tax expense 
we accrue federal  state  and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for certain items including non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits  interest income from tax advantaged investments  as well as changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the provision for income taxes also includes amounts intended to satisfy unfavorable adjustments by tax authorities in any future examination of our income tax returns

table of contents 
index to financial statements comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due to an increase in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs of and from the sale of our audio codecs of 
revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs and of our audio codecs were and  respectively  of total revenues for the year ended december  portable multimedia socs 
the increase in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs was due to the continued growth of the portable multimedia player market and our competitive position within that market as well as increased unit shipments to support new design wins at certain customers 
the increase in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs was partially offset by declines in our overall average selling prices as certain portable multimedia socs products matured and as a result of an aggressive pricing program on our portable multimedia socs that target the value segment of the overall portable multimedia player market 
we expect the trend of declining average selling prices for existing portable multimedia socs products to continue as these products mature further in the market and as the market becomes more competitive  which may have a negative impact on our future margins if we cannot reduce our associated costs accordingly and sell newer products with enhanced features at relatively higher prices and gross margins 
audio codecs and other products 
the increase in revenues from the sale of our audio codecs was due to increased unit shipments to support new design wins at certain customers 
revenues from oasis and protocom products totaled million from the closing date of the respective acquisitions through december  revenues from significant customers 
sales to creative technology  an affiliate until october  decreased to of total revenues during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  due to stronger relative demand for our portable multimedia socs from other customers as well as creative technology experiencing softer than expected overall market demand for their portable multimedia players during the period 
creative technology purchases our standard products at prices and on terms similar to other customers who buy similar products and volumes 
revenues from gmi technology  a distributor located in hong kong and taiwan  decreased from to of total revenues during the year ended december  and  respectively  due to increased sales to direct customers 
revenues from holystone enterprise  a distributor located in taiwan  decreased to less than of total revenues during the year ended december  from during the year ended december   primarily due to increases in our direct sales to customers  rather than making such sales through holystone enterprise  and to increased reliance on other distributors to make sales of our portable multimedia socs in geographic regions such as china 
sales to asustek computer inc increased to of total revenues during the year ended december  from less than during the year ended december  due to increased unit shipments resulting from increased demand for our portable multimedia socs by asustek computer inc s customers  primarily apple computer 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the slight decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an aggressive pricing program on our portable multimedia socs that target the value segment of the overall portable multimedia player market  which was mostly offset by reductions in our manufacturing costs 
we expect our gross margins for the first quarter of to be lower than those achieved during the fourth quarter of we also expect the trend of declining average selling prices for existing portable multimedia socs products to continue as these products mature further in the market and as the market becomes more competitive  which may have a negative impact on our future margins if we cannot reduce our associated costs accordingly and sell newer products with enhanced features at relatively higher prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to increases in our engineering headcount  
table of contents 
index to financial statements including independent contractors  acquired ipr d costs totaling million during the year from the acquisitions of protocom  oasis  and apogee  as well as increases in the costs of design tools and mask sets 
the headcount increases were primarily to support hardware and software development on our latest portable multimedia socs  the stmp xx family of products  audio codecs targeted for applications in the pc market  including the intel high definition audio standard  a new digital fm tuner product  and various usb peripheral ics  as well as development efforts on new audio products for consumer applications 
the protocom ipr d relates to the pr project  a next generation portable imaging soc that adds new features such as h 
an advanced video codec technology and high definition output capability 
the oasis ipr d relates to efforts on six different multi function peripheral products  each of which adds new features or addresses new imaging markets 
the apogee ipr d relates to a next generation direct digital amplification ddx product 
as of the closing date of each acquisition  we expected to incur million  million and million in costs to bring the protocom product  oasis products and apogee product  respectively  to commercialization 
if these products are not brought to market in a timely period  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins 
it is expected that the protocom  oasis  and apogee projects will be completed in and will start generating revenue at that time 
the increase in research and development spending has resulted in substantial progress on our completion of the design of our products and the creation of several patentable inventions  enabling us to identify additional us patent applications we will file covering inventions made during the stmp xx and digital fm tuner design processes 
we expect that research and development expenses could increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenue due to changes in revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to increases in headcount of sales  marketing  and administrative personnel including a substantial increase in personnel located in the asia pacific region  as well as million in legal costs primarily related to ongoing intellectual property litigation against actions semiconductor  located in china 
the increase was also due to increased lease expenses related to additional leased office space both domestically and internationally  as well as increases in legal expenses related to setting up and maintaining our international subsidiaries 
we paid million in and expect to pay million in from general corporate funds related to the lease abandonment charge taken in we do not expect any future charges related to this abandonment 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses could increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and customer support and associated costs  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in revenues 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we record deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants which resulted in amortization expense of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to increased income earned on our cash balances and investments in short term marketable securities 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in expense was primarily due to non deductible charges related to acquisitions in the third fiscal quarter of  and the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the third fiscal quarter of our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
this estimate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non deductible write offs of acquired in process research and development and charges associated with transferring operations and licensing intellectual property to foreign subsidies  offset by research and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements development tax credits 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
this estimate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on management s assessment that it was more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset would be realized 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due to an increase in revenues from our portable multimedia socs  offset by a decrease in revenues from our audio codecs and usb peripheral ics 
the increase in revenues from our portable multimedia socs was due to the growth of the emerging portable multimedia player market and our favorable competitive position within that market 
revenues from our portable multimedia socs were of total revenues for the year ended december  our favorable competitive position in this market is primarily due to our integration of analog and digital components onto a single ic  and the resulting small form factor  low power consumption  and overall low system cost to our customers 
the decrease in revenues from audio codecs was due to decreased sales to sound card manufacturers 
the decrease in revenues from usb peripheral ics was primarily due to competitive pricing pressures 
revenues from gmi technology  our largest distributor located in hong kong  increased by million to of total revenues during the year ended december  from of total revenues during the year ended december  due to stronger demand for our portable multimedia socs in china  including hong kong 
revenue from holystone enterprise  a distributor located in taiwan  increased by million  but decreased to of total revenues during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  due to stronger demand for our portable multimedia socs in geographic regions such as china and south korea 
sales to creative technology  an affiliate until october  increased by million but decreased to of total revenues during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  due to sales growth at other customers and a reduction in sales of their sound cards  which include our audio codecs  partially offset by increased sales of our portable multimedia socs which are a component of their portable multimedia players 
creative technology purchases our standard products at prices and on terms similar to other customers who buy similar products and volumes 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a favorable product mix and a reduction in manufacturing costs  which included both lower wafer costs and lower test costs 
the favorable product mix resulted from increased revenues from our portable multimedia socs as a percentage of total revenues  as the gross margin from these products is generally higher than from our audio codecs 
included in cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million of depreciation related to the abandonment of certain testing equipment 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to increases in our engineering headcount  including independent contractors  as well as increases in the costs of design tools 
such increases were primarily to support hardware and software development on our latest portable multimedia socs  the stmp xx family of products  and our new high definition audio xx family of products 
this increased research and development spending has resulted in substantial completion of the design of these products and the creation of several patentable inventions  enabling us to file additional us patent applications covering inventions made during the stmp xx and xx design process 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenue due to changes in sales volume 

table of contents 
index to financial statements selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was due to increases in sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  as well as increases in commissions paid to independent sales representatives due to our revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million related to the abandonment of a lease of office space 
in december  we abandoned the lease in order to move our austin  texas operations to a larger office space at a lower cost per square foot that would accommodate our rapidly growing staff of engineers as well as support staff 
the total amount incurred in connection with the lease abandonment charge was approximately million  which was expensed in and is reflected in selling  general and administrative expense 
we do not expect any future charges related to this abandonment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million of accelerated amortization related to the abandonment of accounting software 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs  but such expenses will fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales volumes 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we record deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants which resulted in amortization expense of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amounts recorded during the year ended december  include million of amortization expense related to the vesting of an option that occurred as a result of our initial public offering 
litigation settlements 
in september  a lawsuit was filed against us by crystal semiconductor  inc and cirrus logic  inc 
the parent company of crystal alleging that certain of our products infringed two of crystal s patents 
we settled the suit in november as part of the settlement  we issued shares of common stock to cirrus valued at million at the date of issuance  which was recorded as a litigation settlement expense 
we also agreed to a perpetual contingent guarantee which provided that these shares would have a value of at least million at the time of an initial public offering 
upon the closing of our initial public offering in  we recorded an expense of and paid cirrus million in satisfaction of the contingent guarantee 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to increased income earned on our cash balances and investments in short term marketable securities since the completion of our initial public offering in september interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in non cash interest charges related to warrants issued to investors for their guarantee of certain of our indebtedness from april through april  as well as  decreased interest expense on lower levels of debt outstanding during the period 
during the first quarter of  we raised million from sales of our preferred stock and used the proceeds to pay down our debt 
during the third quarter of  we successfully completed an initial public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
a portion of the proceeds was used to pay off all of our existing long term debt 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to increased income before income taxes  as well as an increase in our effective tax rate to for the year ended december  from in the year ended december  the increase in the effective rate was primarily due to management s decision to no longer place a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset  based on the determination that it was more likely than not that we will realize the remaining net deferred tax asset 
our income tax expense for the year ended december  included the benefit of a million reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  million of which represented the utilization of deferred tax assets not previously recognized  and million of which was released by management at september

the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments december  december  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments included in working capital our working capital decreased in primarily related to cash used in investing activities for our acquisitions of protocom and oasis 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisitions 
this was offset by cash provided by operating activities and cash proceeds for issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash from our financing activities and our operating activities 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our short term investments consist primarily of corporate  state and municipal securities 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal operating cash flows during fiscal reflect our net income of million  adjustments primarily for depreciation  amortization  acquired research and development  deferred income taxes  and tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options of million  and a net increase from the changes in assets and liabilities  net of acquired businesses  of million 
our accounts receivable increased million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  due to increases in revenues  the timing of customer payments  and a shift in our revenue base toward increased sales to direct customers 
much of our business has shifted to direct customers and our direct customers generally require longer payment terms 
our inventories increased million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in inventories during the and periods is attributable to increases in seasonal demand for our products during the second half of the year 
our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory as a percentage of total inventory was and as of december  and december   respectively 
we monitor and analyze our inventory for obsolescence and adjust this reserve accordingly 
the reserve increased by million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
during the year ended december   total increases to the inventory reserve were million  which included million in reserves relating to the acquired oasis inventory  and million was released from the reserve as a result of product movement and material scrapped 
our accounts payable increased million and million  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these changes generally relate to changes in our inventories and the timing of payments to our vendors 
the decrease in deferred revenue and other liabilities of million during the year ended december  is net of a million decrease in deferred revenue  million decrease in the lease termination liability and million increase in deferred rent 
the decrease in deferred revenue is primarily due to the shift to direct sales and improved management of distributor inventory levels 
the decrease in the lease termination liability is due to an adjustment recorded to reflect additional subleases that were executed on the abandoned space during the year and rent payments made net of sublease payments received 
our deferred revenue and other liabilities increased by million during the year ended december  due to changes in the amount of our products held at distributors to enable them to meet customer demand of our products 
income taxes payable increased by million for the year ended december  and by zero for the year ended december  research and development resources are required to develop and expand our core technologies and proprietary product

index to financial statements offerings 
our research and development expenses were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenditures resulted in the enhancement of our product offerings  technological know how and inventions that have yielded several us patents and pending us patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and will fund these expenses with operating cash flow and existing cash balances 
included in research and development for the year ended december  was million for acquired in process research and development from oasis  protocom  and apogee 
investing activities 
our investing activities used cash of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
investing activities primarily represented acquisitions of businesses  purchases of capital equipment and purchases and proceeds from maturities of short term investments 
the fair value of our investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds

we could continue to experience growth in our operating expenses  including our research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
additionally  as part of our growth and diversification strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would compliment or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
we intend to fund these activities with cash generated from operations and existing cash balances 
an increase in operating expenses may not result in an increase in our revenue and our anticipated revenue may not be sufficient to support these increased expenditures 
we anticipate that operating expenses  working capital as well as planned capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we believe our existing cash balances and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products and the realization of contingent payouts resulting from our acquisitions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies affecting our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements  the judgments and estimates involved under each 
we also have other key accounting policies that do not involve critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b sab and sab  revenue recognition 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
revenues from product sales to customers other than distributors are generally recognized upon shipment and reserves are provided for estimated allowances 
we defer revenue recognition of nonrecurring engineering fees until contractual obligations are met and the related products are shipped 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or rights of return 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors sell the product to their customers 
customer purchase orders and or

index to financial statements contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery 
management assesses whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
management assesses the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual costs of our inventory or its current estimated market value 
we establish inventory reserves at least quarterly for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories on an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory reserves may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no

 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
this information is contained in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to our option plan at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units  and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we are planning to use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas no 
r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  and risk free interest rate 
we use an estimated volatility that takes into consideration the historical volatility of a peer group including ourselves  and our implied volatility as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options 
stock based compensation expense will be recognized in our financial statements in and thereafter and will be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a periodic basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase  or cancel any 
table of contents 
index to financial statements remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will increase 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows  of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
goodwill 
we made certain acquisitions in the third and fourth quarter of that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year  and in the interim if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
acquired in process research and development ipr d 
when we acquire another entity  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between net tangible assets  ipr d  other identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires sigmatel to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition  in accordance with accepted valuation methods  and includes consideration of the assessed risk of the project not being developed to a stage of commercial feasibility 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we estimate the current tax liability and the tax effect of temporary difference between the financial and tax accounting recognition of income and expenses 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for these temporary difference 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions 
the determination of the provision for income taxes requires sigmatel to take positions on certain issues where there is uncertainty in the application of the tax law 
the provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy unfavorable adjustments by the internal revenue service and tax authorities in other jurisdictions in an examination of sigmatel s income tax returns 
the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties may result in an assessment that is materially different from the current estimate of the liability and may result in significant income tax benefits or expenses being recognized in a future period

r  sigmatel must determine the appropriate fair value method to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method of compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation cost be recorded for all unvested stock options and non vested stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  whereas the retroactive method requires recording compensation cost for all unvested stock options and nonvested stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company has selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method to value awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the awards vesting periods 
the company will adopt the standard using the prospective method 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption

this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on the market value of our investments 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts or investment grade securities 
foreign currency risks 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
sales and inventory purchases made by us and our subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars
