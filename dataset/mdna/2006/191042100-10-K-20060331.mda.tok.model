the declining trend in the two way radio market is expected to stabilize somewhat in as industry unit sales and average retail selling prices stabilize 
the company anticipates that any revenue decrease in two way radio sales will be more than offset by increased sales of detection and its newer products mobile navigation  ten meter radio  marine radios and chartplotters 
results of operations compared to the million increase in net sales from million to million  resulted primarily from higher sales in detection and citizens band radios 
detection sales benefited from the addition in of two major new radar customers  radio shack and sears  as well as strong sales to two of the company s largest existing radar customers  best buy and wal mart 
the increase in sales of citizen band radios was due to strong sales to distributors driven by increased promotional activities by distributors with their customers 
ten meter radios  a new product line in  also contributed to the overall sales increase in offsetting these increases in part were lower unit sales of two way radios  mainly because of a major customer s declining two way business  and handheld gps models as the company was discontinuing this line at this time 
gross margin decreased to from in primarily due to lower net pricing on older mobile navigation models because of the introduction of the new nav one and nav one that have significant new features 
also contributing to the gross margin decline were lower margins on the sale of radar detectors to several customers which require minimal program dollars for advertising and sales promotion activities  thus offsetting the lower margin with lower variable selling expenses 
partially offsetting these margin declines were gains on foreign exchange contracts for the sale of euros and the purchase of us dollars that totaled  as well as a  reduction in cost of sales from the termination of the development agreement with horizon navigation  inc horizon 
in connection with the termination of this agreement  the company had previously identified alternative technology platforms for its mobile navigation products 
to compensate the company for the loss of the horizon platform for future products  horizon refunded to cobra certain development fees previously paid and released cobra from the obligation to pay royalties on remaining sales of products using the horizon platform 
after recognizing the impact of the termination of the development and license agreement on the intangible assets associated with the horizon platform  the net benefit was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales from the horizon settlement

table of contents implementation costs 
in  expenses related to the company s new erp system amounted to approximately  and included consulting and temporary help  travel  meals and training 
it is expected that the costs related to the erp system incurred in will continue into and then moderate in subsequent periods 
r d expense decreased in by  the decrease was due to the capitalization in of certain engineering expenses for mobile navigation software development in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed as the company has devoted more internal resources to mobile navigation product development and significantly reducing its reliance on third party contractors in order to build a stronger proprietary position in the rapidly growing market for mobile navigation products 
it is expected that these expenses will continue to increase as resources are added to support the company s anticipated growth of its mobile navigation business 
interest expense of  for was  less than for  due to lower average debt outstanding during the million increase in other income in  compared to  resulted primarily from the two significant events  which occurred in the first quarter of the first was a million gain that is non taxable  except for alternative minimum tax associated with the payment of a death benefit from life insurance maintained by the company to fund a deferred compensation plan for jerry kalov  the company s former president and chief executive officer

the company also realized a million gain from the sale of unimproved property located adjacent to its office and warehouse facility in chicago 
also contributing to the increase was a gain of  on a lump sum payment in settlement of the deferred compensation obligation to the estate of mr 
kalov 
for  income tax expense increased by  while the effective tax rate decreased to from in the lower effective tax rate was due to the non taxable effect of the gain on life insurance proceeds and a r d tax credit representing eleven prior years of credit 
compared to the million increase in net sales resulted from higher sales of newer products  including mobile navigation  marine electronics as well as increased detection and international sales 
a significant decline in sales in the two way radio category in  both in units and in price per unit  reflected market trends 
this resulted in lower sales for the year to the company s largest customer  wal mart 
however  sales of mobile navigation products drove an increase in sales to best buy  the company s second largest customer 
gross margin decreased from to driven primarily by sales early in the year of certain end of life inventory and  of increased amortization expense on intangible assets in the fourth quarter of  associated with a change in estimated economic useful life for certain handheld gps models 
these sales were partially offset by a favorable impact from a stronger euro in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  but declined as a percentage of net sales from to  reflecting increased r d expenses for new products  expenses related to the company s new erp system and higher deferred compensation expense  partially offset by lower bad debt expenses and a reserve reduction

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions 
the accounting policies and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer estimated based on the average shipping time for all such customers  when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described below 
sales returns reserve 
the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reduction in accounts receivable and increases in inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 
warranty reserve 
the company generally provides a one year consumer warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales and the unit standard cost of each model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in its estimate  as historical experience indicates that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical return rates and how the returned product will be disposed of  either by liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 
liquidation reserve 
the company maintains a liquidation reserve representing the write down of returned product from our customers to its net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for partial credit against similar  new models  this decision depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to the vendor  taking into consideration the liquidation prices expected to be received and the amount of vendor credit 
the amount of the reserve is determined by comparing the cost of each unit returned to the estimated amount to be realized upon each unit s disposition  either from returning the unit to the vendor for credit towards the cost of new  similar product or liquidating the unit 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 
net realizable value reserve 
the company maintains a net realizable value reserve to write down  as necessary  certain inventory not previously sold to customers  except for inventory covered by the liquidation reserve discussed above  below cost 
the reserve includes models where it is determined that net realizable 
table of contents value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included in the reserve and the estimated net realizable value of such model ie  the per unit price that it is estimated can be received in the marketplace if the model was sold 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
advertising and sales promotion accrual 
the advertising and sales promotion accrual reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  generally agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary quarter to quarter depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of its planned program sales  negotiate changes to the term of the existing programs or add new ones  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in such customer s programs 
periodic adjustments may also be necessary for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation 
obligations under the deferred compensation plans most of which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the discount rate for and was percent 
the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future performance 
the company maintains life insurance policies for certain current and former executives to provide funding for future obligations 
as of december   the cash surrender value of the insurance policies in force for the company s president and chief executive officer was  software related to products to be sold 
the company purchases and or incurs costs in connection with the development of software to be used in products that the company intends to sell 
such costs are capitalized and deferred as intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
such costs consist of expenditures incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established and a working model of the product developed and consist principally of coding and related costs 
such costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the estimated product life cycle 
in  certain engineering costs associated with the development of mobile navigation products were capitalized in accordance with sfas no 
 as cobra expanded its internal capabilities and reduced its reliance on outside contractors 
software related intangible assets are periodically reviewed for possible impairment as required by paragraph of sfas no 
and  accordingly  if such review indicates that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value
