item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and other financial information included in this annual report on form k for the years ended december   and introduction our business is organized for managerial purposes along the lines of our reporting segments 
our three operating segments are inventiv clinical  inventiv communications and inventiv commercial 
a fourth reporting segment  other  is a non operating segment that consists of corporate and executive managerial functions 
our operating segment reporting was modified in to account for organizational changes in our business and the cumulative effect of our acquisition activity 
in  we managed three operating segments inventiv commercial  inventiv clinical and inventiv analytic services 
the modification of our operating segments for was driven by the following factors the inclusion of our planning and analytics services business in inventiv commercial for reflects the functional relationship of that business to our contract sales and regulatory compliance businesses 
the inventiv communications segment was formed principally through the acquisition of inchord communications  inc inchord  a healthcare marketing and communications company  in october and adheris  inc adheris  an industry leader in the area of patient compliance and persistency programs  in february critical accounting policies revenue recognition the following is a summary of the company s revenue recognition policy  based on the segment and services we provide inventiv clinical clinical staffing revenues from temporary personnel services  outsourcing and outplacement are recorded when services are rendered 
clinical analysis and data management revenues are mainly achieved and recorded based on milestones  depending on the terms of the contracts 
executive placement permanent placement services revenues are recorded at the time a candidate begins full time employment 
any write offs due to cancellations and or billing adjustments historically have been insignificant 
inventiv communications advertising and communication support retainer revenue is recognized under the proportional performance method  by relating the actual hours of work performed to date to the current estimated total hours of the respective projects 
any anticipated losses on projects are recognized when such losses are anticipated 
time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
branding consultation revenues are mainly based on fee for service  based on the contract 
patient and physician education for its meeting and event services business  the company uses either the completed contract method or bases revenue recognition on defined milestones  depending on the terms of the specific contracts 
interactive communication development time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
inventiv commercial sales and marketing teams revenues and associated costs under pharmaceutical detailing contracts are generally based on the number of physician calls made or the number of sales representatives utilized 
most of our sales and marketing teams contracts involve two phases  a deployment phase  typically three months  in which we perform initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the promotion phase in which our deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients through face to face interactions with physicians referred to as detailing 
most of our ventiv pharma teams contracts specify a separate fee for the initial deployment phase of a project 
we consider the deployment phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognize the related revenues throughout the deployment phase  which typically spans a period of two to three months at the beginning of the first year of a contract 
we generally recognize revenue during the promotion phase of our ventiv pharma teams contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue earned from incentive fees is recognized when we are reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
non refundable conversion fees are earned and recognized as revenue when one of our sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
planning and analytics revenues for hpr generally include fixed fees  which are recognized when monthly services are performed based on the proportional performance method and when payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year 
revenues for additional services are recognized when the services are provided and payment is reasonably assured 
regulatory compliance and patient assistance for regulatory compliance  revenues are recorded based on both fixed fees as well as fees for specific compliance related services both of which are recognized when monthly services are performed  while patient assistance programs depend on the number of patients served and are recognized as each service is performed 
marketing support services revenues are recorded based on time incurred and fulfillment requirements based on contractual terms 
professional development and training revenues are generally recorded as training courses are completed 
general reimbursable costs reimbursable costs  including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to individual or product revenues  and other similar costs  are generally included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services in the period in which such amounts have been finalized 
in certain cases  based on the company s analysis of emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and related accounting literature  the company may also record certain reimbursable transactions  such as the placement of media advertisements where we act as an agent  as net revenues 
loss contracts we periodically analyze our contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product  field force or other performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  we accrue that loss at the time it becomes probable 
we did not have any material loss contracts in billing customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as client advances and unearned revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon billing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled services 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with our aforementioned acquisitions  we have material intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among others  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant  reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
furthermore  changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments thereby impacting the fair value of these assets  which could result in an impairment of the goodwill 
we performed annual impairment tests as of june and concluded that the existing goodwill and tradename balances were not impaired 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million and other intangibles net of million in the consolidated balance sheet 
claims and insurance accruals we maintain self insured retention limits for certain insurance policies 
the liabilities associated with the risk we retain are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation and auto liability claims and estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience with respect to all other liabilities 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  the actual liabilities could vary materially from management s estimates and assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
management believes that these reserves are adequate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of any loss carryforwards or capital losses 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary 
derivative financial instruments we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt 
at hedge inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
the fair values of our interest rate swaps are obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities

our principal external source of liquidity is our syndicated  secured credit agreement  which we entered into with ubs ag  stamford branch  and others in connection with the inchord acquisition 
the key features of this credit facility are as follows a million term loan facility was made available to inventiv in a single drawing at the time of the inchord transaction 
the credit agreement also includes a million revolving credit facility  of which million is available for the issuance of letters of credit  and a million swingline facility 
the term loan will mature on the sixth anniversary of the credit agreement  with scheduled quarterly amortization of per year during years one through five and during year six 
the revolving loans will mature on the sixth anniversary of the credit agreement 
amounts advanced under the credit agreement must be prepaid with a percentage  determined based on a leverage test set forth in the credit agreement  of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement and the proceeds of certain non ordinary course asset sales and certain issuances of debt obligations or equity securities of inventiv and its subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
we may elect to prepay the loans  in whole or in part at any time  in certain minimum principal amounts  without penalty or premium other than normal libor break funding costs 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed 
interest on the loans accrue  at our election  at either the alternate base rate which is the greater of ubs s prime rate and federal funds effective rate plus of or the adjusted libor rate  with interest periods determined at our option of   or months or  if the affected lenders agree  months  in each case plus a spread based on the type of loan and method of interest rate determination elected 
the credit agreement contains  among other things  conditions precedent  representations and warranties  covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type 
such covenants include certain limitations on indebtedness  liens  sale leaseback transactions  guarantees  fundamental changes  dividends  acquisitions and transactions with affiliates 
the credit agreement also includes covenants under which we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest rate coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios that vary based on the amount of time elapsed since the initial extension of credit 
effective october  we entered into a three year swap arrangement for million to hedge against the six year million loan arrangement entered into to facilitate the acquisition of inchord 
this arrangement is discussed more fully under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our cash and equivalents  cash to be provided by operations and available credit under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating requirements over the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund all internal growth initiatives  investments and acquisition activities that we may wish to pursue 
if we pursue significant internal growth initiatives or if we wish to acquire additional businesses in transactions that include cash payments as part of the purchase price  we may pursue additional debt or equity sources to finance such transactions and activities  depending on market conditions 
commitments and contractual obligations a summary of our current contractual obligations and commercial commitments is as follows amounts in thousands amounts due in contractual obligations total obligation less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations b operating leases c total obligations a these future commitments represent the principal and interest payments under the million term loan under our credit facility 
b these future commitments include interest and management fees  which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  but will be recorded as incurred 
c operating leases include facility lease obligations in which the lease agreement may expire during the five year period  but are expected to continue on a monthly basis beyond the lease term  as provided for in the leasing arrangements 
the acquisition agreements entered into in connection with our acquisitions include earn out provisions pursuant to which the sellers will become entitled to additional consideration  which may be material  if the acquired businesses achieve specified performance measurements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk long term debt exposure at december   ventiv had million debt outstanding under its unsecured term loan 
see liquidity and capital resources section for further detail on inventiv s credit agreement 
inventiv will incur variable interest expense with respect to its outstanding loan 
this interest rate risk may be partially offset by our derivative financial instrument  as described below 
based on our debt obligation outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the variable interest rate would have an immaterial effect on interest expense due to the fixed rate associated with the derivative financial instrument 
derivative financial instrument effective october  we entered into a three year swap arrangement for million to hedge against the six year million loan arrangement entered into to facilitate the acquisition of inchord 
we entered into this interest rate swap agreement to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and have designated this qualifying instrument as a cash flow hedge 
at hedge inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million reduction to interest expense relating to the mark to market adjustment required to record hedge ineffectiveness to earnings  and a corresponding derivative asset of approximately million  which was recorded as deposits and other assets on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of our interest rate swaps are obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure inventiv is not currently affected by foreign currency exchange rate exposure  except for any fluctuations in the foreign bank accounts remaining from the divestitures of inventiv s european business units and our equity investments and minority interests in inventiv communications foreign business units  which are not material to our financial statements 
at december   the accumulated other comprehensive earnings was approximately million
