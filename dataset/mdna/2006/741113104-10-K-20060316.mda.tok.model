overview we are a market focused company primarily engaged in the design  manufacture  sales and service of high technology digital imaging solutions to the graphic arts industry worldwide 
we are helping to lead the industry s transformation from analog print production methods to digital imaging technology 
we are a leader in the development of advanced printing systems using digital imaging equipment and consumables based solutions that economically benefit the user through a streamlined workflow and chemistry free  environmentally responsible operation 
we are also a leading sales and service channel in the small to mid sized commercial  quick and in plant printing markets offering a wide range of solutions to over  customers worldwide 
presstek s business model is a capital equipment and consumables razor and blade model 
in this model  almost of our revenue is recurring revenue 
our model is designed so that each placement of either a direct imaging press or a computer to plate system results in recurring aftermarket revenue for consumables and service 
through our various operations  we provide advanced print solutions through the development and manufacture of digital laser imaging equipment and advanced technology chemistry free printing plates  which we call consumables  for commercial and in plant print providers targeting the growing market for high quality  fast turnaround short run color printing  are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek digital solutions and solutions from other manufacturing partners through our direct sales and service force and through distribution partners worldwide  manufacture semiconductor solid state laser diodes for presstek imaging applications and for use by external applications  and manufacture and distribute printing plates for conventional print applications 
we have developed a proprietary system by which digital images are transferred onto printing plates for direct imaging on press applications and for computer to plate applications 
we refer to direct imaging as di and computer to plate as ctp 
our digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
our ground breaking di technology is marketed to leading press manufacturers 
our presstek business segment supplies these manufacturers with imaging kits complete with optical assemblies and software which are integrated into the manufacturers presses 
the result is a di press  which is designed to image our printing plates 
similar digital imaging technologies are used in our ctp systems 
our presstek business segment designs and manufactures ctp systems that incorporate our imaging technology and image our chemistry free printing plates 
in addition to marketing  selling and servicing our proprietary digital products  we also market  sell and service traditional  or analog products for the commercial print market 
this analog equipment is manufactured by third party strategic partners and the analog consumables are manufactured by either us or our strategic partners 
the addition of these non proprietary products and our ability to directly sell and service them is made possible by acquisitions we completed in abdick and precision 
on november   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  abd international  inc completed the acquisition of certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the the ab dick company  which we acquired 
table of contents through a section sale in the united states bankruptcy court 
we refer to the business that we acquired as the abdick business 
the business we acquired manufactures  markets and services offset systems  ctp systems and related supplies for the graphics arts and printing industries 
in  we substantially completed the integration of the operations of the abdick business into presstek 
on july   we acquired all the stock of precision lithograining corporation  an independent plate manufacturer located in south hadley  massachusetts  which we refer to as precision 
precision manufactures our anthem and freedom digital printing plates  and is also a provider of other conventional analog and digital printing plates for both web and sheet fed printing applications to other external customers 
lasertel  inc  a subsidiary of presstek  is primarily engaged in the manufacture and development of high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
lasertel s products include semiconductor lasers and active components for the graphics  defense  industrial  and medical industries 
lasertel offers high powered laser diodes in both standard and customized configurations  including chip on sub mount  un mounted bars  and fiber coupled devices  to support various applications 
after the acquisition of the abdick business  but prior to its integration into presstek  we reported the financial performance of the abdick business in a separate segment called the abdick segment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a new internal management reporting structure in connection with organizational changes related to the integration of the acquired abdick business into our presstek business segment 
accordingly  the results of operations and balance sheet information for the former abdick segment have been combined with those of the former presstek segment and are now reported together as the presstek business segment 
any future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the business segments currently disclosed 
our operations are currently organized into three business segments i presstek  ii precision  and iii lasertel 
segment operating results are based on the current organizational structure reviewed by our management to evaluate the results of each business 
a description of the types of products and services provided by each business segment follows 
presstek is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and servicing of our patented digital imaging systems and patented printing plate technologies as well as traditional  analog systems and related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries  primarily the short run  full color market segment 
precision manufactures chemistry free digital and conventional printing plates for both web and sheet fed printing applications for sale to presstek and to external customers 
lasertel manufactures and develops high powered laser diodes for presstek and for sale to external customers 
we generate revenue through four main sources i the sale of our equipment  including di presses and ctp devices  as well as imaging kits  which are incorporated by leading press manufacturers into direct imaging presses for the graphic arts industry  ii the sale of high powered laser diodes for the graphic arts  defense and industrial sectors  iii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iv the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and ctp systems and related equipment 
our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  such as printing plates  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices 
our strategy to grow our consumables has two parts 
the first part is to increase the number of our di and ctp units in the field 
by increasing the number of consumable burning engines will increase the demand for our consumables 
we rely on partnerships with press manufacturers such as ryobi limited  heidelberger druckmaschinen ag  or heidelberg  and koenig bower ag  or kba  to market printing presses and press solutions that use our proprietary consumables 
we also rely on distribution partners  such as eastman kodak to sell  distribute and service press systems and the related proprietary consumable products 

table of contents another method of growing the market for consumables is to develop consumables that can be imaged by non presstek devices 
in addition to expanding our base of our consumable burning engines  an element of our focus is to reach beyond our proprietary systems and penetrate the installed base of ctp devices in all market segments with our chemistry free and process free offerings 
the first step in executing this strategy was the launch of our non proprietary aurora chemistry free printing plate designed to be used with consumable burning engines manufactured by thermal ctp market leaders screen and kodak 
we continue to work with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances our ability to expand and control our business 
we operate and report on a or week  fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the financial reports for the week fiscal year ended december   which we refer to as fiscal  the week fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal  and the week fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is presented together with results of operations by business segment

revenue into the european market increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of  largely due to our increased european footprint resulting from the abdick acquisition and the integration of the presstek european distributor business with the former ab dick uk limited operation 
product equipment revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the current year increase is primarily attributable to the presstek segment and the abdick acquisition  which 
table of contents business s direct sales channel favorably impacted our installed base of di and ctp presses  referred to as consumable burning engines  or cbes  sold in the current period 
we increased digital equipment sales by approximately units  or million  in the current fiscal year 
revenues generated from consumable product sales were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the current year increase is attributable primarily to incremental revenues associated with the precision and abdick acquisitions 
service and parts revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the current year increase is attributable primarily to incremental revenue derived from the abdick acquisition 
segment revenue in fiscal  we implemented a new internal management reporting structure in connection with organizational changes related to the integration of the abdick business into our presstek business 
we analyzed the impact of this integration on our operating segments and concluded that the results of operations and balance sheet information for the former abdick segment should be combined with those of the former presstek segment and reported as the new presstek business segment 
accordingly  the historical results of the presstek segment included herein have been restated to include the results of the former abdick segment 
as part of the integration  presstek europe was reorganized to combine the presstek european distributor business with the former abdick uk operation to enhance the customer support base for the region 
the following business segment revenue information includes intersegment revenues for the precision and lasertel segments 
intersegment revenues are eliminated in consolidation 
presstek segment revenue for the presstek segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal this revenue increase is primarily attributable to the incremental sales generated from the acquisition of the abdick business and the introduction of presstek technology products into those new distribution channels 
equipment  consumables and service parts revenues increased by million  million and million  respectively 
digital revenues in the presstek segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal a primary factor in the increase in digital revenues in fiscal was an increase in sales of cbes 
product equipment revenue was also favorably impacted by the direct sales channel acquired in the abdick acquisition and the launch of the vector tx  a new generation of ctp system  into us and european markets  which contributed million in incremental revenue in the current year 
in fiscal  we experienced organic growth in several consumable digital product lines  including profire digital media plates  which increased million  or year over year 
in addition  we entered into several strategic consumable relationships  including those with heidleberg naming the quickmaster di as a preferred plate and screen usa to market consumable plate products in non presstek proprietary ctp systems 
in fiscal  we brought back to presstek the previously outsourced service of our digital equipment and introduced di training to service engineers and customer support to drive digital service growth 
our digital service contract mix increased from to in fiscal precision segment revenue for the precision segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal this increase reflects full year financial results for the precision segment in fiscal  compared to the results of the precision segment for the period subsequent to its acquisition in july 
table of contents lasertel segment revenue for the lasertel segment was million in both fiscal and fiscal revenue earned from external customers increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of two significant new customers in the defense and industrial fields 
cost of revenue consolidated cost of revenue consolidated cost of product  consisting of costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses  was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to additional cost of product associated with the precision and abdick businesses acquisitions and higher revenues in the current year 
consolidated cost of service and parts was million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts represent the costs of spare parts  labor and overhead associated with the ongoing service of products 
these increases are attributable primarily to the addition of the abdick business in november segment cost of revenue cost of revenue for the presstek segment was million in fiscal  an increase of million  compared to million in fiscal the increase relates primarily to the addition of abdick and higher production costs driven by increased equipment  consumable and parts sales 
cost of revenue for the precision segment was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase reflects full year financial results for the precision segment in fiscal  compared to the results of the precision segment for the period subsequent to its acquisition in july cost of revenue for the lasertel segment was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal relates to production efficiency gains  yield improvements  and  to a lesser extent  a change in the lives of certain machinery and equipment from five to seven years  resulting in a reduction of depreciation costs of million in both the fourth quarter and fiscal this change in estimate positively impacted net income by million and earnings per share on both a basic and diluted basis by in both the fiscal fourth quarter and year 
consolidated gross margin consolidated gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of product revenue was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the product gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal is primarily the result of the addition of the precision and abdick businesses  together with a higher mix of equipment revenues  which historically carry lower gross margins than presstek s core business 
as the impact of integrating the manufacturing operations of presstek  precision  and abdick is fully realized in fiscal  we expect gross margins to improve 
gross margin as a percentage of service and parts revenue was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the service and parts gross margin percentage increase in fiscal is attributable to integration savings resulting from consolidating operations and a shift from an outsourced service provider to internal services 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses for personnel  parts and supplies  and contracted services required to conduct our equipment  consumables and laser diode development efforts 
our research and development team also contribute to the development  presentation  and launch of new technology products at key industry shows in the us and europe 
consolidated research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal the increase is attributable to additional costs associated with the precision and abdick business acquisitions  partially offset by development supplies costs incurred in fiscal 
table of contents in preparation for the drupa trade show that were not incurred in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses declined from to in fiscal and we expect this decline to continue in future periods as total revenue increases 
research and development expenses for the presstek segment were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal this increase is due to increased salary and benefits costs  partially offset by million of development parts and supply costs incurred in fiscal in preparation for the drupa trade show that were not incurred in fiscal research and development expenses for the precision segment were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the change in from the prior year is primarily attributable to a full year of precision operations in fiscal research and development expenses for the lasertel segment were million in fiscal  an increase of million  compared to million in fiscal this increase relates primarily to increased salary and benefits costs from additional development personnel associated with new product activities  combined with increased development parts and supplies expenses 
while we expect to continue to invest an estimated million internally in research and development in fiscal  our strategy is to identify and collaborate with third parties in development activities designed to leverage presstek technology and innovation 
sales  marketing and customer support sales  marketing and customer support expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses for personnel  advertising  trade shows  promotional expenses  and travel costs associated with sales  marketing and customer support activities

sales and marketing expenses for the lasertel segment were million in both fiscal and fiscal these costs reflect a continuing drive to enhance external revenues from customers in the defense and industrial fields 
in fiscal  we strengthened capacity and capability within the sales  marketing and customer support area through reorganization  training in advanced technology products and services  and changes in key personnel 
in fiscal  we expect expenses in this area to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to pursue initiatives designed to drive penetration of presstek technology 
general and administrative consolidated general and administrative expenses  primarily comprised of payroll and related expenses for personnel  and contracted professional services necessary to conduct our finance  information systems  human resources and administrative activities  were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of abdick and precision  combined with salaries  benefits  professional fees and integration costs incurred by the presstek segment 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflects integration savings associated with the consolidation of operations of both 
table of contents precision and abdick  as well as overall revenue growth of in the period due to such acquisitions 
we expect to see general and administrative expenses decrease as a percentage of revenue in future periods as our strategy is to position the growth of general and administrative expenses at lower rates than the growth of revenue and as the full year impact of integration actions is realized 
general and administrative expenses for the presstek segment were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to additional general and administrative costs associated with the abdick acquisition  coupled with higher salary and benefit costs and increased fees for professional services 
general and administrative expenses for the precision segment were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the change in from the prior year is primarily attributable to a full year of results for this segment included in fiscal general and administrative expenses for the lasertel segment were million in fiscal and million in fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  relates to intangible assets recorded in connection with the company s abdick and precision acquisitions  patents and other purchased intangible assets 
restructuring and special charges credits in fiscal  we charged million of restructuring and special charges related to precision and abdick to results of operations 
these charges consisted of severance and fringe benefit costs  executive and other contractual obligations  and a settlement with previously terminated employees 
in fiscal  we also incurred net costs of million associated with the integration of abdick into presstek 
these costs were recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price of the acquisition 
we have already benefited from the resulting cost reductions and expect the full impact to be realized in fiscal on an annualized basis  restructuring benefits have exceeded million 
in fiscal  we reversed million of excess restructuring charges related to estimated severance and fringe benefits accrued in fiscal and as a result of lower actual fringe benefit costs 
interest and other income expense  net interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to higher average debt balances related to financing the two acquisitions completed in and higher interest rates on borrowings 
effective august   we amended our debt facilities to reduce the current applicable libor margin to  from the previous applicable libor margin of 
we recorded interest income of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal is principally a result of decreased cash balances available for investment 
the primary components of other income expense  net  are gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and disposals of long lived assets 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded losses on foreign currency transactions of  and  respectively 
we recognized losses on the disposals of long lived assets totaling  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the variance from the federal statutory rate for fiscal was primarily due to the recognition of a non cash deferred tax liability for goodwill  foreign taxes  and alternative minimum taxes 

table of contents in fiscal  our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state  foreign and alternative minimum tax  offset by increases in the valuation allowance 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million which were subject to consideration of a valuation allowance 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the net deferred tax assets in the us due to the uncertainty of their realization 
in the future  continued sustained profitability will cause us to reassess the need for the valuation allowance 
we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to our results of operations and adjustments to recorded goodwill and shareholder equity in the period in which the benefit is determined

from time to time we have engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  we may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  we may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  we would  under these arrangements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price a shortfall payment 
the maximum contingent obligation under these shortfall payment arrangements is estimated to be million at december  as of december   there were no defaults by ultimate lessees 
effect of inflation inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes totaling million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for us federal tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent that net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation 
table of contents deductions become realizable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any future period may be subject to certain limitations  based upon changes in the ownership of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  allowances for doubtful accounts  slow moving and obsolete inventories  long lived assets and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue principally from the sale of products equipment  laser diodes  consumables and services installation  training  support  spare parts and equipment maintenance contracts 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no future services related to the installation are required 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment and services  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value 
when the fair value of an undelivered element cannot be determined  the company defers revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered 
a general right of return or cancellation does not exist once product is delivered to the customer  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
product revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically  based upon historical rates of return 
the estimated cost of post sale obligations  including product warranties  is accrued based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized 
the company records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until all revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company accounts for shipping and handling fees passed on to customers as revenue 
shipping and handling costs are reported as components of cost of revenue product and cost of revenue service and parts 
products end user customers under the company s standard terms and conditions of sale of equipment  title and risk of loss is transferred to third party end user customers upon completion of installation and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant deliverables remain 
sales of other products  including printing plates  are recognized at the time of shipment 
oem relationships product revenue and any related royalties for products sold to companies with whom we have an oem relationship are recognized at the time of shipment 
contracts with companies with whom we have oem relationships do not include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 

table of contents distributor relationships revenue for product sold to distributors  whereby the distributor is responsible for installation  is recognized at shipment 
revenue for equipment sold to distributors whereby the company is responsible for installation  for which the installation is not deemed inconsequential  is recognized upon completion of installation and customer acceptance 
except in the case of termination of the contract  which includes product return rights  contracts with distributors do not include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
services and parts revenue for installation services  including time and material contracts  is recognized as services are rendered 
revenue associated with maintenance or extended service agreements is recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue associated with training and support services is recognized as services are rendered 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue is otherwise earned 
sales transactions financed with recourse clauses from time to time the company has engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  the company may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  the company may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  the company would  under these agreements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price 
when such recourse obligations are of such a magnitude to indicate that substantial risk of ownership of the equipment has not transferred to the third party purchaser  the company would record the transaction as a financing transaction to the extent they are material individually or in the aggregate to the operating results of the period in which the transactions occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms  carried at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and adjusts for potential credit losses when it determines that receivables are at risk for collection based upon the length of time receivables are outstanding  past transaction history and various other criteria 
receivables are written off against reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectible 
product warranties presstek warrants its products against defects in material and workmanship for various periods  determined by the product  generally from a period of ninety days to a period of one year from the date of installation or shipment 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents property  plant and equipment  net property  plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the life of the related asset 
the estimated useful lives assigned to the company s other property  plant and equipment are as follows buildings and improvements years production equipment and other years office furniture and equipment years the company periodically reviews the remaining lives of property  plant and equipment as a function of the original estimated lives assigned to these assets for purposes of recording appropriate depreciation expense 
factors that could impact the estimated useful life of a fixed asset  in addition to physical deterioration from the passage of time and depletion  include  but are not limited to  plans of the enterprise and anticipated use of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of  as part of its periodic review process  the company performed a review of the machinery and equipment of its lasertel subsidiary and related assumptions and expectations for this machinery and equipment 
as a result of this review  the company determined that the original estimated useful life of five years assigned to certain assets at the time of purchase should be extended to seven years 
the effect of this change in accounting estimate resulted in a reduction to depreciation expense of million in the fourth quarter of  and contributed million to net income and to reported basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal acquisitions in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined and recorded as of the date of the acquisition 
the company utilizes an independent valuation specialist to determine the fair values of identifiable intangible assets acquired in order to determine the portion of the purchase price allocable to these assets 
costs to acquire the business  including transaction costs  are allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
as part the allocation of purchase price  the company records liabilities  including lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
throughout the allocation period  these accruals are reviewed and adjusted for changes in cost and timing assumptions 
goodwill and intangible assets presstek has goodwill and net intangible assets of million at december  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the goodwill provisions of sfas intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable  the company will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax operating cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
the company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return of the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
judgment is also required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the 
table of contents value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  strategic changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
we must make assumptions about future cash flows  future operating plans  discount rates and other factors in the models and valuation reports 
patents represent the cost of preparing and filing applications to patent the company s proprietary technologies  in addition to certain patent and license rights obtained in the company s acquisitions or other related transactions 
such costs are amortized over a period ranging from five to seven years  beginning on the date the patents or rights are issued or acquired 
from time to time the company enters into agreements with third parties under which the third party will design and prototype a product incorporating presstek products and technology 
the capitalized costs associated with these types of agreements will be amortized over the estimated sales life cycle and future cash flows from sales of the product 
the company does not amortize capitalized costs related to either patents or purchased intellectual property until the respective asset has been placed into service 
the company amortizes license agreements and loan origination fees over the term of the respective agreement 
the amortizable lives of the company s other intangible assets are as follows trade names years customer relationships years software licenses years non compete covenants years accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we monitor the realization of our deferred tax assets based on changes in circumstances  for example  recurring periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations 
our income tax provisions and our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and estimates 
if we continue to generate taxable income through profitable operations in future years we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which would result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined  excluding the recognition of the portion of the valuation allowance which relates to net deferred tax assets acquired in a business combination and stock compensation 
the company does not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries  which the company considers to be permanent investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  commodity price risk  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has established procedures to manage its fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our long term borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held at the end of fiscal commodity price movements create a market risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials 
the company purchases aluminum for use in manufacturing consumables products and is embedded in certain components we purchase from major suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with certain suppliers to manage price risks within a specified range of prices  however  our suppliers generally pass on significant commodity price changes to us in the form of revised prices on future purchases 
in general  the company has not used commodity forward or option contracts to manage this market risk 

table of contents the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada and europe and is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
presstek routinely evaluates whether the foreign exchange risk associated with its foreign currency exposures acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency 
in general  the company does not hedge the net assets or net income of its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  certain key customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these parties may be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  certain major suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the united states dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
