historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods 
critical accounting policies our policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment 
if a product sale does not meet all of the above criteria  the sale is deferred until all criteria are met 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
periodically  we sell products together with a product upgrade option that requires that the customer pay an upgrade fee at the time of exercise  has no refund provisions and includes an expiration date on the upgrade option 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we defer the fair value ascribed to the upgrade option until the expiration of the upgrade option or the exercise of the upgrade option and shipment of the product upgrade 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and eitf  based on the relative fair market value of each element 
we recognize royalty revenue from licensees upon receipt of cash payments since the royalty amounts are not fixed and determinable at the end of a quarter 
in general  licensees are obligated to make payments days after the end of each quarter 
we account for funded development revenue from gillette and johnson johnson consumer companies  inc in accordance with the work plan that was developed with both gillette and johnson johnson consumer companies  inc revenue is recognized under the contracts as costs are incurred and services are rendered 
any amounts received in advance of costs incurred and services rendered from gillette or johnson johnson consumer companies  inc are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments from both gillette and johnson johnson consumer companies  inc are non refundable if the development is not successful 
we provide services under a million research contract with the united states department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the contract is a cost plus fee arrangement whereby we are reimbursed for the expenses incurred in connection with pfb research plus an fee 
revenue is recognized under the contract as the costs are incurred and the services are rendered 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide a general reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs and defaults 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular order  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
included in our inventory are demonstration products that are used by our sales organization 
we account for such products as we do with any other finished goods item in our inventory in accordance with the review of our entire inventory 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detail review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
we typically offer a one year warranty for all of our products 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty reserves include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
we assess the adequacy of the warranty provision and we may adjust this provision if necessary 
income taxes 
we currently have net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these net operating losses generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as there is significant uncertainty that we will not be able to fully utilize the net operating losses 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these net operating losses change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted
