item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and risk factors contained in our sec filings 
overview structure and business as of march   we own full service luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and we are the largest hotel reit in the national association of real estate investment trust s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or avoid federal income taxes at the corporate level 
host operates as a self managed and self administered reit and owns approximately of the partnership interests of host lp 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry including marriott  ritz carlton  hyatt  four seasons  fairmont  hilton and westin 
approximately of our hotels as measured by sales are currently managed by marriott international or its affiliates and branded under the marriott or ritz carlton brand names 
the majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference destinations 
the target profile for our portfolio includes luxury and upper upscale full service properties in urban and resort conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
though hotels meeting this target profile will still be subject to competitive pressures  we believe this will allow us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we also seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in maximizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business  and contract business  approximately  and  respectively  of our business in similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these segments based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient demand broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers and is divided into four key sub categories premium  corporate  special corporate and discount 
overall  business travelers make up approximately of transient demand at our hotels  with leisure travelers making up the remainder 
therefore  our business will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand premium sometimes referred to as rack rate  typically consists of rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality  weekday vs 
weekend stays 
corporate this is the benchmark rate which a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it is typically the second highest category  and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiate or discount rates 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel 
these rates are typically negotiated annually  at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate 
discount this encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through internet distribution and wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 
group demand represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion 
group business is segmented into the following three key sub categories association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternity and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final segment is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently low levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees related to the revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to operate the property  including purchasing inventory and paying wages  utilities  property taxes and other expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution  which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation  from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  depending on the manager 
hotel revenue is approximately of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is the key driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  telephone  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 
hotel departmental expense 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  telephones  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue as set forth in our management contracts 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed threshold levels established in our management agreements 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change in tandem with changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that is relatively inflexible and changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of post acquisition capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statement of operations 
it is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items  however  taken separately these costs represent approximately of our total expenses  making wages and benefits the most significant component of our cost structure 
key performance indicators we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
revenue per available room  or revpar  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to evaluate the results of individual hotels between periods and our comparable hotels 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for further discussion of what we consider to be our comparable hotels 
revpar changes driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in these additional room related costs 
for this reason  while operating profit typically increases when occupancy rises  revpar increases due to higher room rates would have a greater impact on our profitability 
a related revenue measure for our hotels is the revpar penetration index 
the revpar penetration index reflects each property s revpar in relation to the revpar for that property s competitive set 
we use the measure as an indicator of a property s market share 
for example  a revpar penetration index of would indicate that a hotel s revpar is  on average  the same as its competitors 
a revpar penetration index exceeding would indicate that a hotel maintains a revpar premium in relation to its competitive set  while a revpar penetration index below would be an indicator that a hotel is underperforming its competitive set 
one critical component in this calculation is the determination of a hotel s competitive set 
factors that we consider include geographic proximity  as well as the level of service provided at the property 
for example  a hotel located near a convention center might have a competitive set that includes other hotels located in close proximity to the convention center 
additionally  a luxury hotel might include other luxury or upper upscale hotels in its competitive set but not economy hotels 
competitive set determinations are highly subjective  however  and our methodology for determining a hotel s competitive set may differ materially from those used by other owners and or managers 
we assess profitability by measuring changes in our operating margin  which is operating profit as a percentage of total revenue 
another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit which is a non gaap measure  and which is used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability 
the comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels 
see non gaap financial measures comparable hotel operating results for further discussion 
we also use  among other things  ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
see non gaap financial measures ffo per diluted share for further discussion 
each of the non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit and earnings per unit 
starwood acquisition on november   we announced that we had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire luxury and upper upscale hotels from starwood for approximately billion 
the portfolio consists of domestic and international properties and a total of  rooms managed under the westin  sheraton  w hotels  the luxury collection and st 
regis brands collectively  the starwood portfolio 
as part of the acquisition  we expect to assume approximately million of debt and to issue approximately billion of equity  common shares at the exchange price of per share to starwood stockholders 
the remainder of the purchase price will be paid in cash 
in connection with the completion of the starwood acquisition  we intend to change our name to host hotels resorts  inc and to change the new york stock exchange symbol that our common stock is traded under to hst 
the acquisition is expected to close in early april  and is subject to the approval of our stockholders  as well as other closing conditions 
the acquisition is subject to a number of terms and conditions that could delay or prevent the closing of the acquisitions  or result in modifications  such as the exclusion of particular hotels due to the failure to obtain required consents or certain other developments 
see risk factors risks related to the acquisition of the starwood portfolio 
the starwood portfolio is comprised of luxury and upper upscale hotels located primarily in urban  convention or resort destinations with an average size of approximately rooms including six city center hotels with over rooms 
the portfolio is geographically diverse both domestically and internationally  with most assets located in markets with strong growth profiles and limited near term supply 
the portfolio includes international properties  which will expand our geographic distribution into new markets outside of the united states 
six hotels representing of the portfolio by revenue are located in europe  and three hotels representing of the portfolio revenues are in canada 
additional hotels are located in fiji and in chile 
as a result of the acquisition  our percentage of revenues from international hotels will increase from approximately to approximately 
we believe that many of these international markets are in the early stages of lodging recovery  offering the opportunity for additional growth outside of the domestic lodging cycle 
in addition  we will increase our presence in key domestic markets such as new york  boston  san diego and seattle as a result of this acquisition 
we are also expanding an important relationship with starwood  and thereby diversifying our brand representation 
the portfolio consists of sheraton  westins  two w hotels  one st 
regis hotel  one the luxury collection hotel and one additional unbranded hotel 
with the addition of these hotels  of our portfolio by revenue will consist of marriott branded hotels  while westin branded hotels will represent  up from prior to the acquisition  and sheraton and w branded hotels will represent and  respectively 
currently  we do not own any sheraton or w branded hotels 
in addition  we expect to work with starwood to add value to the portfolio through aggressive asset management and believe that our expanded relationship will foster additional growth opportunities for both companies in the future 
upon completion of the acquisition  we expect to be one of the largest lodging companies in the us and the sixth largest public reit 
we will own luxury and upper upscale hotels with approximately  rooms that are affiliated with brands located in over markets in nine countries 
we have received commitments from goldman sachs credit partners  lp  deutsche bank ag cayman islands branch  bank of america bridge llc and merrill lynch capital corporation in an aggregate amount of up to billion  which is sufficient to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the transactions 
the bridge loan facility has a term  excluding extensions  of one year 
we expect to permanently finance the billion cash portion of the purchase price for the transactions through available cash proceeds from a combination of i asset sales of existing assets of approximately million including the swiss tel the drake  new york  the fort lauderdale marina marriott  the albany marriott  chicago marriott deerfield suites and the marriott at research triangle park  ii sales of joint venture interests related to the six european assets to be acquired and iii the issuance or other incurrence of indebtedness to repay any remaining draws on the bridge loan facility 
we are in discussions with third parties regarding such a joint venture and expect that we would retain approximately to of the equity interests in the joint venture while obtaining approximately million to million of financing  including new debt to be issued by the joint venture but excluding our portion of the capital contributions to the joint venture 
depending upon the timing of the closing of the asset sales and permanent financing transactions  proceeds therefrom may be used to repay the bridge loan facility

the conversion is expected to be completed in the first quarter of outlook for  revpar for our comparable hotels increased as compared to improvements in revpar at our comparable hotels for were primarily driven by significant increases in average room rates and  to a lesser extent  by increases in occupancy 
this is a result of a number of positive trends  such as strong united states gdp growth  low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels and the strengthening in the group and transient segments of our business 
as a result of these trends  we expect comparable hotel revpar to increase approximately to for we expect the supply growth of luxury and upper upscale hotels to continue to be low for the next two to three years 
although always subject to uncertainty  supply growth is relatively easier to forecast than demand growth due to the long permit  approval and development lead times associated with building new full service hotels or expanding existing full service hotels 
based on data provided by lodging econometrics  luxury and upper upscale hotel supply growth in the top us markets is expected to increase by approximately and in and  respectively 
the performance of our portfolio is also significantly affected by the results of our large hotels  including our convention hotels  the majority of which are located in major urban markets 
convention hotels have historically outperformed in the early stages of an industry downturn  however  they also lag the industry in performance in the early stages of recovery 
this primarily is due to the longer booking lead time for large group business and the need for transient demand in a market to recover to more substantial levels given a greater capacity of rooms 
in  we saw significant improvement in the operations of our convention hotels in certain markets  such as new york city and washington dc our large hotels situated in weaker markets continue to lag the portfolio  but we are beginning to see signs of improving market strength in several of these markets including boston and to a lesser extent san francisco 
we have also recently initiated major projects at our convention hotels in atlanta and orlando with the intention of enhancing their competitive market position and improving performance 
we expect increasing demand to continue to improve operations at our large convention hotels as markets strengthen  which should positively affect margin and revpar growth 
operating margins improved in  as the average room rate increases at our hotels significantly exceeded the rate of inflation  a trend we expect to continue 
operating margins continue to be affected  however  by certain costs  primarily wages  benefits  utilities and sales and marketing  which increased at a rate greater than inflation  a trend that we also expect to continue in the near term 
we expect utility costs to increase by over in  although these costs represent only approximately of our revenues 
additionally  as a result of the large scale devastation due to hurricanes this year  we expect insurance costs  which were approximately of our total costs and expenses in  to increase in at a rate that significantly exceeds inflation 
in addition  several markets have union contracts that expire in  including new york  hawaii  chicago  toronto  boston and los angeles 
the union contracts in san francisco expired in one outcome of these negotiations could be potential increases in labor costs by increased wages  benefits and or changes in work rules that increase costs 
any increases in labor costs are likely to increase labor costs in these markets generally  including at non union hotels  because of competitive pressure to pay market wages 
other potential affects of these negotiations could include temporary disruptions in group bookings and or hotel operations and it is difficult to predict their outcome at this time  although we do not believe the outcome of these negotiations will have a material effect on our results of operations 
operating margins are also affected by our food and beverage operations  which represented of our revenues 
during  food and beverage revenue growth at our comparable hotels was  with a food and beverage margin increase of percentage points 
as the economy continues to grow  we expect food and beverage revenue to continue to increase  in particular catering revenue  which should result in further improvement in our operating margins 
we also expect to see improvements in revpar and operating margins as we continue our strategy of recycling assets 
over the past two years  we have acquired individual luxury and upper upscale properties in urban and resort convention destinations  where further large scale lodging development typically is limited  and have disposed of individual assets primarily in suburban and secondary markets 
the assets we have acquired have higher revpar  higher margins and  we believe  higher growth potential than those we have sold 
over time  these assets should contribute to improvements in overall revpar and margins  as well as an increase in the average per room replacement cost of our portfolio 
the expected revpar for the starwood portfolio is roughly comparable to the revpar for our current hotel portfolio 
during  the average revpar penetration index for our comparable hotels declined slightly as we continued to work with our managers to optimize the market positioning and business mix of our hotels 
we believe that this decline in market share has occurred because many of our hotels occupy the number one or number two positions in their competitive set and achieve meaningful revpar premiums 
in several markets lower ranked hotels have improved their competitive position through renovation or other means resulting in a narrowing of our revpar premium 
our hotels generally have a higher percentage of their revenues generated by corporate group and corporate transient customers than many of our competitors and that business in the luxury and upper upscale segment did not begin to significantly increase until the second half of  we have a significant number of large hotels in our portfolio  including nine convention hotels with greater than  rooms  which require longer periods of time to achieve optimal group bookings and business mix 
as lodging demand continues to grow and  in particular  as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthens  we believe our revpar penetration index will improve 
while we believe the combination of improving demand trends and low supply trends in the lodging industry discussed here creates the opportunity for improvements in our business in and  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns 
all of the above  as well as the risks set forth in the section forward looking statements  may result in lower revenues or higher operating costs and declining operating margins 
management s priorities based on forecasted operating conditions  our key management priorities over the next several years include the following complete the acquisition of the starwood portfolio and the integration of those hotels into our asset management program  to work with our managers to increase revenues and minimize operating costs  to invest capital in our existing portfolio to maintain our assets and pursue repositioning roi opportunities 
potential investments at our hotels could include increasing the number of rooms  building a spa  fitness facility  convention or meeting space or upgrading the infrastructure  such as energy efficient heating and cooling systems  to explore opportunities to maximize the value of existing assets by converting all or part of a property s underutilized space to alternate uses such as timeshare or condominium units  to acquire luxury and upper upscale hotels in locations with high barriers to entry  including hotels in urban and resort conference locations  to use the proceeds from the sale of non core hotels to acquire properties more closely aligned with our target profile or to repay debt  and to reduce our leverage  over time  to achieve an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of x or greater under our senior notes indenture and seek to maintain a balanced maturity schedule with an average maturity of no less than five years 
consistent with these priorities  we acquired the hyatt regency washington on capitol hill in washington  dc for approximately million in we sold five non core properties for approximately million and completed the sale of of our interest in the cbm joint venture llc  which owns courtyard by marriott properties  for a sales price of approximately million in thus far in  we have sold four properties for gross proceeds of approximately million 
we have also signed a definitive agreement to sell the swiss tel the drake  new york on or about the end of the first quarter for gross proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  we raised approximately million from the issuance of our series o senior notes in we used those funds  along with funds raised through asset dispositions  to acquire properties and to repay or refinance approximately million in senior notes  million in mortgage debt and million of redeemable preferred stock  which improved our interest coverage ratio and overall leverage ratio 
similarly  we spent approximately million in on repositioning and roi projects 
we expect to spend an additional million to million on such investments over the next several years 
by contrast  we had limited our expenditures on such development projects in and based on our assessment of the relatively weak operating environment and to preserve capital 
we believe we successfully executed on a number of these management priorities in  taking advantage of the positive trends in the hotel industry noted above  as well as strong conditions in the us capital markets 
we also believe that the acquisition of the starwood portfolio is a very important step in furtherance of these priorities 
there can be no assurances  however  that these trends will continue or that we will be able to continue to execute on all  or any  of these priorities over the next several years 
recent events between december and february   we issued million shares of host common stock upon conversion of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures and corresponding convertible preferred securities 
the securities were convertible at the option of the holder into shares of host common stock at the rate of shares per liquidation amount of convertible preferred security equivalent to a conversion price of per share of the company s common stock 
as of february   million of subordinated debentures and corresponding preferred securities remain outstanding and the right to convert those securities into host common stock has expired 
we intend to redeem these securities in the second quarter of on january   we issued mortgage debt in the amount of million canadian dollars million us dollars based on the exchange rate on the date of issuance with a fixed interest rate of 
the mortgage debt is secured by four of our canadian properties and matures on march  on january   a portion of the proceeds were used to repay the million outstanding balance under our credit facility 
in  we have sold  or have  subject to customary closing conditions  signed contracts to sell five properties the swiss tel the drake  new york  the fort lauderdale marina marriott  the albany marriott  the marriott at research triangle park  and the chicago marriott deerfield suites for expected total proceeds of approximately million and a total estimated gain in excess of million 
we expect to use the proceeds from the sales to partially fund the acquisition of the starwood portfolio and for other corporate purposes 
we recently negotiated amendments to various management agreements with marriott international and agreed  among other matters  to waive performance termination tests through the end of fiscal year  to modify certain extension tests which condition the manager s ability to renew the management agreements  and to extend certain contracts for ten additional years 
as part of this negotiation  marriott international in turn agreed to make a cash payment to us  to reduce an existing cap on the costs and expenses related to chain services that are provided on a centralized basis  as well as to establish a cap on certain other costs  to provide us with an incentive to increase our capital expenditures at the hotels through  to waive certain deferred management fees  and to modify the incentive management fee on certain contracts 
in addition  we agreed to use a portion of marriott international s cash payment for brand reinvestment projects at various hotels in our portfolio

n m not meaningful compared to hotel sales overview 
hotel sales increased million  or  to approximately billion for hotel sales include approximately million and million for and  respectively  of sales from hotels acquired in and sales for properties sold in or or classified as held for sale as of december  have been reclassified as discontinued operations on our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
see discontinued operations below 
we discuss operating results for our full service hotels on a comparable basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred significant property damage and business interruption or large scale capital improvements during these periods 
as of december   of our full service hotels have been classified as comparable hotels 
the following discussion is of the sales results of our comparable hotels considering the mix of business ie transient  group or contract  property type ie urban  suburban  resort conference or airport and geographic region 
see comparable hotel operating statistics for a complete description of our comparable hotels and further detail on these classifications 
comparable hotel sales increased to approximately billion for the revenue growth reflects the increase in comparable revpar of  as a result of an increase in average room rates of and an increase in occupancy of percentage points 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased  primarily due to an increase in catering and outlet revenues 
comparable hotel sales by customer mix 
demand was strong in  enabling our operators to significantly increase average daily room rates  particularly in the premium and corporate transient segments 
for our comparable marriott hotels  which represent of our total comparable rooms  premium and corporate transient average daily rates increased when compared to last year 
our overall transient average room rate for these hotels increased 
the gap between transient and group rate widened in indicating pricing power is strong 
with increased levels of transient demand  we expect our managers to continue aggressive growth in room rates in total group room revenue for our comparable marriott hotels increased compared to last year  primarily due to an increase in average room rates of approximately 
room rates for groups should continue to improve in  as a lower percentage of group business would have been booked for those periods in or earlier when room rates were significantly lower than those our managers were able to charge 
currently  group booking pace has declined modestly for  reflecting our managers strategy of keeping more rooms available for the higher rated transient segments 
however  we are experiencing meaningful growth in the average daily rate of our definitive group business for comparable hotel sales by property type 
for  revenues increased significantly across all of our hotel property types  led by our airport hotels with a comparable hotel revpar increase of  which reflected an average room rate increase of 
our urban hotels performed well in  with comparable hotel revpar growth of to 
the significant increase in comparable hotel revpar at our urban properties was primarily driven by an increase in average room rate of  while average occupancy improved by percentage points 
our resort conference hotels had comparable hotel revpar growth of to  with average room rate growth of 
these hotels include many of our florida hotels  which experienced a decline in revpar in the fourth quarter due to hurricane wilma 
our suburban hotels experienced a comparable hotel revpar increase of  which reflected an average room rate increase of 
comparable hotel sales by geographic region 
for full year  the majority of our geographic regions experienced strong growth in comparable hotel revpar with the dc metro  mountain  mid atlantic and pacific regions all experiencing double digit growth rates 
our dc metro region had a comparable hotel revpar increase of 
the improvement was driven by consistent strong performance at all of our hotels in the region  which benefited from solid group and business transient demand 
overall  comparable hotel revpar increases for the region reflected an average room rate increase of and an average occupancy increase of percentage points 
our mountain region experienced a comparable hotel revpar increase of  led by a revpar increase at our three comparable hotels in the denver market 
we also experienced an revpar growth at our hotels located in the phoenix scottsdale area 
comparable hotel revpar for our mid atlantic region increased 
the increase was driven by the performance at our three new york city hotels with comparable hotel revpar growth of  which was the strongest revpar growth in any of our major urban markets for the year 
strong group  transient and international demand has strengthened the performance in the new york city market 
our pacific region had a comparable hotel revpar increase of  as we experienced strong revpar growth in the los angeles  hawaii and san diego markets 
comparable hotel revpar in our florida region grew by as a result of comparable hotel revpar increases at our tampa and miami fort lauderdale hotels of and  respectively 
the region s fourth quarter results were significantly affected by business interruption due to hurricane wilma  which struck southern florida in october 
our atlanta region rebounded from a difficult third quarter revpar decline of to post a full year revpar increase of  after a strong fourth quarter revpar increase 
the rebound for the region is attributable to strong transient business demand  which was supplemented by the relocation of two city wide events from new orleans 
comparable hotel revpar for our new england region increased 
our hotels in the boston market  which had underperformed during the first three quarters of  had a strong fourth quarter with revpar growth of  which resulted in an annual revpar growth of 
we expect operating growth at these properties to improve in based on expected increases in convention activity and an overall improvement in the boston economy 
the north central region of our portfolio experienced an increase in comparable hotel revpar of as average room rates increased 
the region was led by our chicago hotels  where revpar increased 
overall  comparable hotel results in our south central region  which includes texas and louisiana  were not significantly affected by hurricane katrina 
however  the operations of the new orleans marriott  which is considered a non comparable hotel  have been  and will continue to be  affected by the large scale devastation in new orleans 
revpar in the region grew by  driven primarily by strong increases in occupancy and average room rate at our three properties in houston  which benefited from business resulting from the evacuation of the gulf coast in the aftermath of hurricane katrina 
comparable hotel revpar for our international properties increased 
our four canadian properties  three of which are in toronto  experienced an increase in comparable hotel revpar of 
rental income 
our rental income represents lease income from our leased limited service hotels and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one full service hotel 
the million improvement in rental income primarily is from operations at the leased limited service hotel properties which have continued to improve as a result of the stronger economy and the completion of a major renovation projects at most of these properties in property level operating costs 
property level operating costs and expenses increased to approximately billion for property level operating costs and expenses exclude the costs for hotels we have sold and held for sale at december   which are included in discontinued operations 
our operating costs and expenses  which are both fixed and variable  are affected by changes in occupancy  inflation and revenues  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
for example  utility costs increased  primarily due to increases in oil and gas prices  while the increase in management fees of were a direct result of the growth in the revenues and profitability of our properties 
we expect the number of hotels reaching these thresholds and the incentive management fees earned to increase in we expect operating costs to continue to increase in as a result of variable costs increasing with occupancy increases  and certain costs increasing at a rate above inflation  particularly utilities  wages and benefits and insurance 
during  we incurred property damage to six properties located in new orleans and various sites in florida due to hurricane rita and hurricane wilma 
our insurance policy provides us with reimbursement for the replacement cost for the damage done to these assets 
as a result  we have written off the approximate million book value of the damaged assets  which includes certain repair and clean up costs 
the write off of the assets has been completely offset by the establishment of an insurance receivable and  accordingly  there is no effect on the statement of operations

specifically  interest expense includes million for and million for for the call premiums and the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts associated with debt prepayments 
these declines in interest expense were partially offset by increased interest rates for our variable rate debt

minority interest expense

the increase in our minority interest expense for primarily is due to the increase in the net income of host lp  as well as the net income of certain of our consolidated hotel partnerships that are partially owned by third parties 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates

benefit from provision for income taxes

hotel sales increased to approximately billion for hotel sales for include approximately million of sales for the three hotels acquired in and exclude sales for the properties we have sold or classified as held for sale as of december  for all periods presented  which have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 
we discuss operating results for our full service hotels on a comparable basis 
as of december   of our full service hotels were classified as comparable hotels 
comparable hotel sales increased to approximately billion 
the growth in revenues reflects the increase in comparable revpar of for  as a result of a strong increase in occupancy of percentage points  and an increase in average room rate of 
food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased  primarily due to an increase in catering revenues and the overall increase in occupancy 
comparable hotel sales by customer mix 
continuing a trend we noted in the first three quarters of  the business mix of our portfolio is showing a shift in transient room nights  from lower rated discount business to higher rated corporate and premium business 
for  total transient room revenue for our comparable marriott and ritz carlton hotels was up compared to last year  as premium and corporate occupancy increased to of total transient demand  up from last year  while our average transient room rate increased by 
this indicates that our hotel managers had greater success in reducing the number of rooms sold at discounted rates as a result of improving transient demand 
for  total group room revenue for our comparable marriott and ritz carlton hotels was up compared to last year  primarily due to an increase in occupancy of approximately  while our average group room rate was up slightly  or 
this increase reflects the increased business travel and the steady growth in the economy 
additionally  our managers improved overall occupancy by accepting greater numbers of advance room reservations for groups  which resulted in fewer rooms available for transient business 
comparable hotel sales by property type 
for full year  revenues increased consistently across all of our hotel property types 
comparable hotel revpar increased   and for urban  suburban  resort conference and airport properties  respectively 
the largest increases were for our airport hotels  which reflected a significant increase in business travel in compared with the significantly depressed levels of and comparable hotel sales by geographic region 
during  we experienced revpar gains in most regions 
full year comparable hotel revpar in our new england region improved over the prior year 
the region benefited from the democratic national convention during the third quarter and was led by the hyatt regency boston  which was converted from the swiss tel brand in late  where revpar improved by for the year 
comparable hotel revpar increased for our dc metro region due primarily to a increase in average room rates in growth was slowed during the year by rooms renovations at four of our hotels in the region 
for our atlanta region  comparable hotel revpar grew by 
the improvement was led by the grand hyatt  atlanta  the four seasons  atlanta and the ritz carlton  atlanta  where revpar increased  and  respectively 
our pacific region  which had lagged behind the portfolio as a whole during and  continued to improve as comparable hotel revpar increased  with significant increases in occupancy 
the primary reason this region had been underperforming over the past three years was the decline in travel related to the area s technology companies  particularly in the san francisco bay area 
the improvement in the pacific region in reflects an increase in comparable hotel revpar at our san francisco market hotels of 
the results for the pacific region also reflect a increase in comparable hotel revpar at our properties in the los angeles market 
comparable hotel revpar in our mid atlantic region improved over the prior year 
our new york city properties benefited from the republican national convention in the third quarter and strong demand in the fourth quarter of for  comparable hotel revpar in the florida region improved over during august and september  four hurricanes caused significant damage in florida

revpar in other regions was relatively unchanged from revpar declined in our south central region  while revpar in our north central and mountain regions experienced comparable revpar increases of and  respectively 
comparable hotel revpar for our international properties increased for our four canadian properties  three of which are in toronto  experienced increases in revpar of  as the region has recovered from the sars related travel restrictions in and the effect of the favorable appreciation of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
rental income 
our rental income represents lease income from our leased limited service hotels and three office property leases  as well as lease income from one full service hotel 
in  operations at the leased limited service hotel properties suffered because a significant portion of these properties underwent renovations to enable them to compete with newer hotels and the weak economic conditions in their markets 
while several leased properties still were under renovation in  the properties that underwent renovations in performed substantially better 
this was the primary reason for the increase in total rental income of million to million during property level operating costs 
property level operating costs and expenses increased to approximately billion 
property level operating costs and expenses exclude the costs for hotels we have sold and held for sale  which are included in discontinued operations 
comparable hotel expenses increased to approximately billion 
the increase in operating costs and expenses is due to additional costs associated with an increase in occupancy at our hotels and an increase in wage  benefit  utility and sales and marketing costs 
operating costs and expenses also include base and incentive management fees  which are earned based on the operating performance of our individual hotels 
corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs such as employee stock based compensation expense  corporate insurance  audit fees  building rent and system costs 
during  these expenses increased million  primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense as a result of the significant appreciation in our stock price since december  and an increase in the number of shares that we may issue that are subject to performance criteria established by the compensation policy committee of the board of directors 
interest expense 
during  interest expense decreased million 
interest expense for includes million of interest which was previously classified as dividends on convertible preferred securities 
interest expense includes million and million of call premiums and accelerated deferred financing costs and original issue discounts that were associated with debt prepayments made in and  respectively 
after excluding these items  interest expense decreased approximately million due to the significant amount of debt repayments and refinancings that occurred in and net gains on property transactions 
net gains on property transactions are due primarily to the recognition of deferred gains 
in  we sold a portfolio of fairfield inns by marriott and received a note receivable in partial payment 
subsequently  we recorded a loss on the note due to a decline in the operations of the hotels 
during  the owner of the hotels filed for bankruptcy and several properties were sold 
we recognized a previously deferred gain of approximately million based on the amount of the proceeds we received 
loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts 
during  the loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is primarily due to the approximate million loss from the foreign currency exchange contracts related to mortgage debt that was secured by three of our canadian hotels for the majority of  as the value of the us dollar continued to decline in relation to the canadian dollar 
these contracts were deemed ineffective for hedge accounting purposes in  which resulted in an million loss at that time 
minority interest expense 
minority interest expense consists of our minority partners share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate ownership in host lp 
equity in losses of affiliates 
equity in losses of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings losses of two partnerships in which we own non controlling interests 
the decrease in the loss can be attributed to a decrease in the net loss of cbm joint venture llc in and an increase in the income from our investment in tiburon golf ventures  lp discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of the results of operations and the gain or loss on disposition of five hotels sold in  nine hotels sold in  eight hotels sold in  and the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for the new york marriott world trade center hotel in  as well as the operations of two hotels classified as held for sale at december  for and  revenues for these properties were million and million  respectively  and income before taxes for the same periods was million and million  respectively

as a reit  we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income 
funds used to make these dividends are provided from host lp 
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
cash balances 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was a decrease of million from december  the decrease primarily is attributable to the acquisition of the hyatt regency washington on capitol hill in washington  dc for a purchase price of approximately million of available cash  significant capital expenditures during the year  the redemption of our preferred stock and dividend payments 
these cash outlays were partially offset by an increase in cash provided by operations and proceeds from hotel sales 
as a result  we have now reduced our cash balances closer to the million to million level that we have historically maintained based on the flexibility and capacity provided by our credit facility and the continuing growth of the economy 
as of december   we also had million of cash that was restricted as a result of lender requirements  which was a decrease of million from december  including reserves for debt service  real estate taxes  insurance  as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits 
on october   escrowed funds held in accordance with restrictive debt covenant requirements of approximately million were released to us as a result of meeting certain conditions 
the remaining restricted cash balances do not have a significant effect on our liquidity 
we have approximately million of debt that will mature in  in addition to principal amortization of million 
however  million of this debt can be extended for three one year terms if certain conditions are met 
we believe we have sufficient cash  or availability under our line of credit to deal with our near term maturities as well as any potential decline in the cash flow from our business 
on october   we borrowed approximately million of our available capacity under our credit facility to retire the remaining mortgage on our canadian properties and for general corporate purposes  of which million was repaid during the fourth quarter with the release of the restricted cash discussed above and available cash 
the remaining balance was repaid in the first quarter of acquisitions

in addition to the pending acquisition of the starwood portfolio  we remain interested in pursuing single asset and portfolio acquisitions  both domestically and abroad 
we believe there will continue to be opportunities in the near term and over the next several years to acquire assets that are consistent with our target profile of luxury and upper upscale properties in urban and resort convention destinations where further large scale development is limited 
we may acquire properties through various structures  including transactions involving portfolios  single assets  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate entities 
we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods  including proceeds from equity offerings of host  issuance of op units by host lp  advances under our credit facility  our available cash and the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness 
we may  from time to time  be in the process of identifying  analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
we cannot be certain as to the size or timing of acquisition opportunities or of our ability to obtain additional acquisition financing  if needed 
additionally  the number of potential acquirers for individual hotel properties has increased due to the improvement of both the capital markets and the lodging industry and  as a result  the cost of acquiring properties has increased 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to find acquisition targets that provide a suitable return on investment

reducing future interest payments and leverage remains a key management priority

we may continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time to take advantage of favorable market conditions 
we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share  as defined below  as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs

senior notes general 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issues by the operating partnership  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of the operating partnership s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of the operating partnership 
the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x by the operating partnership 
this ratio is calculated in accordance with our senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as interest on our convertible subordinated debentures  call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the calculation is based on our pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to the transactions  such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness excluding our convertible subordinated debentures of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate values and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens 
exchangeable senior debentures 
on march   we issued million of exchangeable senior debentures and received proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and expenses and an original issue discount 
these debentures were issued under our senior notes indenture  and are the only series of senior notes that are exchangeable into common stock 
the exchangeable senior debentures mature on april  and are equal in right of payment with all of our unsubordinated debt 
interest is payable quarterly in arrears on january  april  july and october of each year 
we can redeem for cash all  or part of  the exchangeable senior debentures at any time subsequent to april  upon days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture 
holders have the right to require us to repurchase the exchangeable senior debentures on april   april  and april  at the issue price 
the exchangeable senior debentures currently are exchangeable into shares of common stock at a rate of shares for each  of principal amount of the debentures  or a total of approximately million shares  which is equivalent to an exchange price of per share of common stock 
the exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances  including the payment of common dividends 
holders may exchange their exchangeable senior debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions  including at any time at which the closing sale price of the common stock is more than of the exchange price per share  for at least of trading days 
the exchangeable senior debentures and the common stock issuable upon exchange of the debentures have not been registered under the securities act and may not be offered or sold except to qualified institutional buyers  as defined 
we have a shelf registration statement that currently is effective with respect to the resale of the common stock issuable upon exchange of the debentures 
credit facility general 
on september   we entered into an amended and restated credit facility 
the credit facility replaced our prior credit facility and provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of million 
the credit facility also includes sub commitments for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million and loans to certain of our canadian subsidiaries in canadian dollars in an aggregate amount of million 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity in september we have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met at the time of the initial scheduled maturity 
we also have the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders  whether or not currently party to the credit facility  commits to be a lender for such amount 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under our credit facility  which was subsequently repaid in the first quarter of as with the prior facility  the debt under the amended credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently is secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
as with the prior facility  the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
dual tranche structure 
unlike our prior facility  the revolving loan commitment under the amended credit facility is divided into two separate tranches a revolving facility a tranche of million and a revolving facility b tranche of million 
subject to compliance with the facility s financial covenants  amounts available for borrowing under revolving facility a vary depending on our leverage ratio  with million being available when our leverage ratio is less than x  million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x but is less than x  million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x but is less than x  and no amounts being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x 
by contrast  the entire amount of revolving facility b is available for borrowing at any time that our unsecured interest coverage ratio equals or exceeds x and our leverage ratio does not exceed levels ranging from x to x 
specifically  prior to the end of our third quarter of  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under revolving facility b so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x  the maximum leverage ratio applicable to revolving facility b is then reduced to x from the end of the third quarter of until the day prior to end of our third quarter of  and is reduced to x thereafter 
financial covenants 
we are subject to different financial covenants depending on whether amounts are borrowed under revolving facility a or revolving facility b  and we are permitted to convert amounts borrowed under either tranche into amounts borrowed under the other tranche 
while the financial covenants applicable under revolving facility a are generally comparable to those contained in our prior facility including covenants for leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage  the financial covenants applicable to revolving facility b are limited to leverage and unsecured interest coverage  and are set at less restrictive levels than the corresponding covenants applicable to revolving facility a 
as a result of this structure  we have gained flexibility to make and maintain borrowings in circumstances where adverse changes to our financial condition could have prohibited the maintenance of borrowings under the prior facility 
the financial covenants for the revolving facility a and revolving facility b do not apply when there are no borrowings under the respective tranche 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding we are not in default of the credit facility if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the amended credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants 
we are in compliance with all our covenants as of december  the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility through facility a financial covenant levels year minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio facility b financial covenant levels quarter minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio first quarter to second quarter third quarter to fourth quarter interest and fees 
we pay interest on borrowings under the revolving facility a at floating interest rates plus a margin which  in the case of libor based borrowings  ranges from to that is set with reference to our leverage ratio 
borrowings under revolving facility b are subject to a margin that is higher than the corresponding margin applicable to revolving facility a borrowings and 
higher when our leverage ratio is greater than x 
as with the prior facility  to the extent that amounts under the amended credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment 
other covenants 
our amended credit facility imposes restrictions on customary matters that were also restricted in our prior facility  such as limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  the incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends 
while such restrictions are generally similar to those contained in our prior facility  we have modified certain covenants to become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments and dividends will be replaced by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
first amendment 
on january   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility in anticipation of the closing of the acquisition of the starwood portfolio and associated financing transactions  including  among other things  the anticipated bridge loan facility 
the amendment authorizes the collateral agent under the credit facility to amend the associated pledge and security arrangements to share the benefit of the pledge and security agreement collateral with creditors under the bridge loan facility and creditors under certain other indebtedness that may be incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition of the starwood portfolio 
in addition  whereas the credit facility previously permitted such collateral to be released at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive quarters  the amendment requires that such collateral be maintained so long as any loans or commitments under the bridge loan facility are incurred and remain outstanding 
mortgage debt general 
as of december   we had assets that were secured by mortgage debt 
substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
as of december   secured debt represented approximately of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of and an average maturity of years 
over time  we expect to reduce the amount of our secured debt as a percentage of our total debt 
we may refinance secured debt with other financing alternatives  such as senior notes  although there can be no assurances that we will achieve this objective 
as a result of the decline in operations of our properties in and  restrictive covenants on eight of our hotel properties secured by a million mortgage loan  which we refer to as the cmbs loan  were triggered 
these hotel properties are the new york marriott marquis times square  the hyatt regency san francisco airport  the hyatt regency cambridge  overlooking boston  the hyatt regency reston  the hyatt regency boston  the swiss tel the drake  new york  the westin buckhead atlanta  and the swiss tel chicago  which we refer to as the cmbs portfolio 
the cmbs loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain certain excess cash flow from the cmbs portfolio after payment of debt service if net cash flow after payment of taxes  insurance  ground rent and reserves for furniture  fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
this provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of and remained in effect until the cmbs portfolio generated the necessary minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters  at which point  the cash that had been escrowed will be returned to us 
as of the end of the third quarter  operating cash flow from these properties for the past two quarters met the levels required to release the escrowed funds under the cmbs loan and on october  escrowed funds in the amount of approximately million were released to us 
additionally  in conjunction with the anticipated sale of the drake on or about the end of the first quarter  it will be removed as collateral securing the cmbs loan and the recently acquired hyatt regency washington will be substituted as collateral 
on october   we retired the remaining mortgage secured by two of our canadian properties with the prepayment of approximately million 
during january  we issued mortgage debt in the amount of million canadian dollars million us dollars based on the exchange rate on the issuance date with a fixed interest rate of  which is secured by four of our canadian properties and matures on march  the following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of december  in millions balance as of december  thereafter mortgage debt cmbs loan   due orlando marriott world center   due san diego marriott   due host hotel properties ii   due atlanta marriott marquis   due desert springs marriott resort and spa   due harbor beach marriott   due boston marriott copley place   due jw marriott washington  dc   due philadelphia marriott convention center   due other mortgage debt total mortgage debt other debt philadelphia marriott airport industrial revenue bonds   due capital leases and other total other debt total mortgage and other debt this mortgage debt is secured by eight hotel properties and has certain restrictive covenants 
effective with the pending sale of the drake  the hyatt regency washington will be substituted as collateral for the loan 
this mortgage debt is secured by first mortgages on three hotels  as well as a pledge of our limited partnership interest in the santa clara partnership 
beginning in  the interest rate on this loan increases a minimum of basis points and all excess cash as defined in the loan agreement generated by the partnership is applied to principal  however  the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date 
the amortization presented in this table is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate  but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow 
beginning in  the interest rate on these loans increases a minimum of basis points and all excess cash as defined in the loan agreement generated by the partnerships that own these two properties is applied to principal  however  the loans can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date 
the amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate  but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow 
this floating rate mortgage is based on libor plus 
the rate shown is at december  also  this mortgage has an interest rate cap derivative with a maximum rate of 
during september  we exercised the first of three one year extension options under the loan agreement 
certain requirements must be met in order to exercise the second and third one year options 
other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than million  have an average interest rate of at december  and mature through capital leases and other consist of million outstanding under our credit facility  which was repaid in the first quarter of  three loans with an average interest rate of that mature through  as well as capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity dates 
credit ratings currently  we have billion of senior notes outstanding and million of preferred stock that are rated by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
on november   standard and poor s upgraded the rating on our senior debt from a b rating to a bb rating and upgraded the rating on our preferred stock from a ccc rating to a b rating 
on october   moody s upgraded our senior notes debt from a ba rating to a ba rating and the preferred stock from a b rating to a b rating 
while we have no senior note maturities until  if our operations or our credit ratios were to decline  the ratings on our securities could be reduced 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue additional senior notes  either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise  or to issue additional preferred stock would likely increase 
host dividend policy host is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income to qualify as a reit  including taxable income recognized for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash 
funds used by host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from host lp 
for every share of common and preferred stock of host  host lp has issued to host a corresponding common op unit and preferred op unit 
currently  host is the owner of substantially all of the preferred op units and approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
as a result of the minority position in host lp common op units  these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp 
as a general rule  when host pays a common or preferred dividend  host lp pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred op units 
for example  if host paid a twelve cent per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on payment of a twelve cent per unit distribution by host lp to host as well as other common op unit holders 
for these reasons  investors also should take into account the minority position in host lp  and the requirement that they share pro rata in distributions from host lp  when analyzing dividend payments by host to its stockholders 
host s current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute at least of its taxable income  unless otherwise contractually restricted 
host currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock  regardless of the amount of taxable income  unless similarly contractually restricted 
the amount of any dividends will be determined by host s board of directors 
the following table sets forth cash distributions on our common stock during  and declaration date payment date amount december  january  share september  october  share june  july  share march  april  share september  december  share off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  host marriott services corporation and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host 
we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of five hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
these agreements require that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreement 
we also have agreed not to sell more than of the original allocated value attributable to a portfolio of additional hotels  or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes 
because the timing of these potential transactions is within our control  we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and therefore not material to our financial statements 
on average  these restrictions will generally expire  or cease to be significant  in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of three hotels in the fourth quarter of and january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases and projected capital expenditures  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred management fees total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate for both fixed and variable debt 
for variable rate debt  we have used the applicable percentage interest rate as of december  future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the hpt subleases of million and million  respectively  payable to us under non cancelable subleases 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the current year amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed 
see capital expenditures 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates impairment testing 
we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired  whereby  future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge when a property s fair value is less than its net book value 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel s net book value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our hotels  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  holding period  expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  assumptions  future changes in economic conditions  or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges  which would be reflected in operations in the future 
classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met our board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar magnitude of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
to the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
see the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  in consolidated deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million in deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we had three interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  our interest rate swap agreements with a fair market value of approximately million as of december  have been designated as fair value hedges  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective  any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings 
should any change in management strategy  or any other circumstance  cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective  the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be reclassified from the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet to current net income loss 
we also have two interest rate cap agreements that are fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss 
we estimate the fair value of all of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
currently  we have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
these entities are considered to be voting interest entities 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to the company and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
while we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures  if we were required to do so  then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements 
application of new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in fas we adopted the fair value provisions of fas in and  therefore  have recognized the costs associated with all share based payment awards granted after january  the provisions of fas r are effective as of january  the adoption of this standard in will not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarified the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
a conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
as a result of the issuance of this statement  we will recognize the fair value of the liability for any conditional asset retirement obligations when incurred  which is generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset  if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
reporting periods reporting periods for consolidated statement of operations the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott international  the manager of the majority of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt  report results on a monthly basis 
host  as a reit  is required by tax laws to report results on a calendar year 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott international modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott international but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as our calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december reflects an additional day in february for the leap year 
while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott international  another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately one fourth of our full service hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
reporting periods for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott international for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks such as fiscal year versus sixteen weeks 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations 
hotel result reporting periods for operating statistics and comparable hotel results for marriott managed properties start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter december march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december reflects an additional day in february for the leap year 
non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures  which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  within the meaning of applicable sec rules 
they are as follows i funds from operations ffo per diluted share  and ii comparable hotel operating results 
the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ffo per diluted share we present ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo defined as set forth below for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders benefit 
the following tables provide a reconciliation of net income loss available to common shareholders per share to ffo per diluted share in millions  except per share amounts reconciliation of net income loss available to common shareholders to funds from operations per diluted share year ended december  income per share income per share loss shares amount loss shares amount net income loss available to common shareholders adjustments gain on dispositions  net amortization of deferred gains depreciation and amortization partnership adjustments ffo of minority partners of host lp a adjustments for dilutive securities assuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plan less shares assumed purchased at average market price assuming conversion of exchangeable senior debentures assuming conversion of convertible subordinated debentures ffo per diluted share b c a represents ffo attributable to the minority interests in host lp 
b ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities 
dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans  those preferred op units held by minority partners  convertible debt securities and other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common op units 
no effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive 
c ffo per diluted share and earnings loss per diluted share for certain periods presented were significantly affected by certain transactions  the effect of which is shown in the table below in millions  except per share amounts year ended december  net income net income loss ffo loss ffo senior notes redemptions and debt prepayments preferred stock redemptions gain on cbm joint venture llc sale gain on hotel dispositions minority interest benefit expense total per diluted share represents call premiums and the acceleration of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs  as well as incremental interest during the call period for refinancings  included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations

represents the original issuance costs for preferred stock  which were required to be charged against net income loss available to common stockholders in conjunction with the redemption of the class b preferred stock in the second quarter of and the redemption of the class a preferred stock in the third quarter of the adjustment in also includes the incremental dividends from the date of issuance of the class e preferred stock to the date of redemption of the class a preferred stock 
for further detail  see note to the condensed consolidated statements 
represents the gain  net of tax  on the sale of of our interest in cbm joint venture 
represents the portion of the above listed amounts attributable to minority partners in host lp 
comparable hotel operating results we present certain operating results for our full service hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors 
our comparable hotel operating results present operating results for full service hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions  significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods 
we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management 
the following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein comparable hotel results in millions  except hotel statistics year ended december  number of hotels number of rooms percent change in comparable hotel revpar comparable hotel sales room food and beverage other comparable hotel sales comparable hotel expenses room food and beverage other management fees  ground rent and other costs comparable hotel expenses comparable hotel adjusted operating profit non comparable hotel results  net comparable hotels classified as held for sale office buildings and limited service properties  net other income depreciation and amortization corporate and other expenses gain on insurance settlement operating profit the reconciliation of total revenues per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel sales is as follows in millions year ended december  revenues per the consolidated statements of operations revenues of hotels held for sale non comparable hotel sales hotel sales for the property for which we record rental income rental income for office buildings and limited service hotels other income adjustment for hotel sales for comparable hotels to reflect marriott s fiscal year for marriott managed hotels comparable hotel sales the reconciliation of operating costs per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel expenses is as follows in millions year ended december  operating costs and expenses per the consolidated statements of operations operating costs of hotels held for sale non comparable hotel expenses hotel expenses for the property for which we record rental income rent expense for office buildings and limited service hotels adjustment for hotel expenses for comparable hotels to reflect marriott s fiscal year for marriott managed hotels depreciation and amortization corporate and other expenses gain on insurance settlement comparable hotel expenses non comparable hotel results  net  includes the following items i the results of operations of our non comparable hotels whose operations are included in our consolidated statement of operations as continuing operations and ii the difference between the number of days of operations reflected in the comparable hotel results and the number of days of operations reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the majority of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate 
we use some derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are presented in us dollar equivalents  which is our reporting currency 
the interest rate swaps and caps that we have entered into are strictly to hedge interest rate risk and not for trading purposes 
expected maturity date fair value thereafter total in millions liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate variable rate average interest rate total debt interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate excludes the fair market value of the interest rate swaps which totaled approximately million as of december  as of december   approximately of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates 
we have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our credit facility 
the interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over libor  ranging from to 
there was million outstanding on our credit facility at december  we expect the proportion of fixed rate debt in our capital structure to range from to of our total debt  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us 
in furtherance of this objective  we have entered into three interest rate swaps effectively converting million of fixed rate payments to floating rate payments based on a spread to libor 
on december   we entered into a year interest rate swap agreement  which was effective on january  and matures in january  effectively converting our series i senior notes to floating rate debt 
under the swap  we receive fixed rate payments of and pay floating rate payments based on one month libor plus basis points on a million notional amount  which is equal to the current amount of outstanding series i senior notes 
on august   we entered into two four year interest rate swap agreements  which mature october  effectively converting our series g senior notes to floating rate debt 
under the swaps  we receive fixed rate payments of and we make floating rate payments based on six month libor plus basis points on a million notional amount  which is equal to the current amount of outstanding series g senior notes 
we have designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreements will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of the swap and the series i senior notes and series g senior notes  respectively  are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect 
the fair value of the series i interest rate swap at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the series g interest rate swaps at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
these amounts are included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt and the above swap agreements increase or decrease by basis points  the change in interest expense would change future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada and mexico  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into are strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
on august   our canadian subsidiaries entered into a mortgage loan pursuant to which they borrowed million denominated in us dollars at a variable rate of libor plus 
at that time  we entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting canadian dollars to us dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments  which were designated as cash flow hedges of the debt service payments  and the forward contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in december  we entered into certain transactions which resulted in the forward contracts no longer qualifying as hedges 
we recognized a loss of approximately million in  which was previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  the change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations each period 
for and  we recorded a gain of million and a loss of million  respectively  related to these contracts 
in january and october  we assigned the notional amounts of the foreign currency contracts of approximately million and million  respectively  to a third party for approximately million and million  respectively  which approximated the fair value of those contracts on the date of sale 
after these sales  we have no outstanding notional amount under these contracts and no foreign currency exchange agreements
