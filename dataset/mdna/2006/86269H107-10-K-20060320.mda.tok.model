overview we develop and manufacture biological products  instruments and software designed to improve the speed and accuracy of life sciences research and clinical diagnosis 
we market our products to researchers and clinicians in clinical laboratories and academic  hospital and government institutions  as well as to scientists in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  in the us and internationally 
scientists and clinicians use our products to identify genes and proteins  study how genes and proteins regulate cells  determine the molecular mechanisms of health and disease  search for new drug therapies  and develop diagnostic tests 
we engage in business activity in two operating segments research supplies and clinical diagnostics 
we have marketed and sold our research supplies products for over years  while the clinical diagnostics products are a new addition to our product portfolio as a result of the merger with hycor biomedical inc in june hycor s experience in manufacturing and marketing food and drug administration  or fda  regulated clinical diagnostic products also spans years 

table of contents merger with hycor on june   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of hycor biomedical inc through our merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of our company with hycor  with hycor continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
pursuant to the merger  hycor s stockholders received of a share of our common stock in exchange for each share of hycor common stock  plus cash for any fractional shares 
the merger has been recognized as a tax free reorganization 
we filed a registration statement on form s no 
and related amendments in connection with the transaction  which registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on april  we incurred merger related costs of approximately million  which were capitalized as a component of the purchase price 
bch asset acquisition concurrently with the closing of the hycor merger  we acquired substantially all of the assets of biocrest holdings  llc  or bch  including bch s interests in its subsidiaries 
in exchange  we forgave all of the outstanding intercompany indebtedness owed by bch and its subsidiaries to us of approximately million and assumed all of the other outstanding liabilities of bch and its subsidiaries of approximately million 
because we and bch were under common control  with substantially all of the bch membership units held by certain of our shareholders  the acquisition of bch was recorded on a historical cost basis 
as such  there was no adjustment of bch s assets and liabilities to fair value and no goodwill resulting from the purchase 
as of and for the year ended december   our financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis 
there was no change to income for previous periods presented on a combined basis 
for income tax purposes  this transaction was taxable 
the financial statements in reflected net deferred tax assets of  for differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities that we acquired 
with the completion of the initial consolidated tax returns in  we adjusted the deferred tax asset associated with the acquired assets and liabilities and reflected a reduction of approximately  to the net deferred tax asset and additional paid in capital in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
prior to the acquisition date  we presented our financial statements on a combined basis with bch 
bch was a limited liability company treated as a partnership for income tax purposes  therefore  any related income tax obligations were the responsibility of the members of bch 
as a result  the operations of bch did not reflect a provision for income taxes in the combined financial statements 
beginning on june   our consolidated results  which includes the results of bch  includes a provision for income taxes 
as part of the acquisition of bch  we acquired bch s interests in its subsidiaries  which include phenogenex  llc  or phenogenex  iobion informatics  llc and subsidiaries  which we refer to collectively as iobion  and an investment in a joint venture consisting of a interest in a limited partnership  which we refer to as the lp  that operates a research lab 
the investment in a joint venture was accounted for under the equity method 
in december  the lp redeemed our rights and interests in the lp 
at the time of the bch acquisition  we owned of phenogenex and approximately of iobion 
the remaining interest in iobion was held by two individuals  one of which is now an employee of iobion and the other is a consultant to us 
in october  we purchased the remaining outstanding membership interests in iobion owned by these individuals 
as a result of the purchase of these minority interests  we now own of iobion 
total cash consideration of  was paid and was recorded to intangible assets based on the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
during  we merged iobion and phenogenex into us  leaving only the iobion informatics canada  ltd 
subsidiary remaining  and on february   we dissolved bch 
there was no financial statement impact to this merger or dissolution 
basis of presentation our financial information has been presented on a consolidated basis  and includes the results of operations of hycor biomedical inc and subsidiaries since we acquired hycor on june  the financial 
table of contents information also includes the results of operations of bch  whose assets we acquired on june  and accordingly is presented on a consolidated basis for all periods see note to financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following use of estimates preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from research supplies  diagnostic and basic instrumentation product sales under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which is generally when we ship the products  transfer title and eliminate our risk of loss 
in accordance with statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 for instrumentation products where software is considered more than incidental to the product  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time we ship the product and transfer the title 
when contractual acceptance clauses exist  we recognize revenue upon satisfaction of such clauses 
we earn and recognize contract research service revenues in accordance with contract provisions 
we record amounts received in advance of performance or acceptance as deferred revenue 
the following table summarizes the types of deferred revenue and the timing of when we recognize that revenue type of deferred revenue when recognized extended warranty or maintenance agreements recognized over the term of the contract  generally months 
in most cases  these contracts were sold at the time of product purchase and the recognition of revenue begins after the warranty period  which is generally one year 
license agreements recognized over the term of the agreement  generally months 
the following table provides the percentage of the ending balance in deferred revenue that each type of deferred revenue represents as of december for each year presented type of deferred revenue extended warranty  installation or maintenance agreement license agreements total deferred revenue accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we regularly monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any 
table of contents specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
our credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory on specifically identified items based primarily on an estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
our losses from disposal of excess or obsolete inventory have historically been within expectations and the provisions established 
however  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in addition  rapid technological change or new product development could result in an increase in the quantity of obsolete inventory on hand 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of products sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of products sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale or disposition 
additionally  our manufacturing costs and inventory carrying costs are dependent on our accurate estimates of customer demand for our products 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand and increase the expense of storing and maintaining the inventory until it is sold 
as a result  although we attempt to maximize the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes our deferred tax assets relate to prior operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income and tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
we also recognize deferred taxes for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the amount of deferred income tax assets to be recognized pursuant to sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
long lived assets we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangibles  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these statements require that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets be reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
with the acquisition of hycor in the second quarter of  we have substantial amortizable and non amortizable long lived assets including goodwill that are reviewed for impairment annually and when there is an indication that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we would recognize is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
royalties we enter into license agreements in the ordinary course of our business  which require royalty payments based on specified product sales 
these agreements cover the majority of our products 
we believe that we determine the royalties we calculate and accrue in accordance with the patent license agreement 
however  our royalty calculations are subject to review by the license holder 
therefore  our financial position or results 
table of contents of operations could be materially affected if the parties determine that the royalties differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded 
from mid through late  we withheld payments to a license holder while we evaluated a possible overpayment in the royalties we paid in prior periods 
during this time  we continued to accrue and record the estimated quarterly royalty payable under the patent license agreement and reported this amount to the license holder 
as of december   the amount of accrued and unpaid royalties related to this patent license agreement was million 
the patent underlying this royalty obligation expired in the united states in march of and resulted in an approximately  per quarter reduction in royalty expense beginning in the second quarter of in addition  upon the expiration of the corresponding foreign patents in and  we expect an additional  reduction in royalty expense beginning in the second quarter of we anticipate that this decrease in royalty expense will be partially offset by decreases in the average unit selling price of products using the patented technology following the expiration of the patents 
warranties we generally warrant certain equipment against defects in workmanship or materials for a period of one year from the date of purchase 
upon shipment of equipment sold that includes a warranty  we establish  as part of cost of products sold  a provision for the expected costs of such warranty 
while our warranty costs have historically not been significant  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return and repair rates that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product return and repair rates could have a material adverse impact on operating results for the period or periods in which such items materialize 
derivative financial instruments we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and related literature  which we refer to collectively as sfas no 
during  we entered into derivative instruments to reduce the risk of foreign currency fluctuations  however  such derivative instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of sfas no 
accordingly  we recognized both unrealized and realized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value as incurred in gain loss on foreign currency transactions in the consolidated income statements 
research and development we focus our research and development efforts on developing products that use innovative technologies in both the research supplies and clinical diagnostics product lines 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
for the years ended december   and  our research and development expenses totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively  and we intend to spend between and of our revenues on research and development activities for at least the next few years 
our numerous research and development initiatives are generally ongoing 
some of the efforts are for new product technologies  while others are designed to support an existing product or products relating to one of our more than  stock keeping units  which cover approximately existing product categories 
in addition  the funds we used in our research and development activities are allocated among the various technologies and products in which we are currently involved and are not concentrated to one specific product or product line 
we do not provide forward looking estimates of costs and time to complete any of our individual ongoing research and development projects because none of such projects are material to our company on an individual basis 
in addition  any such estimates would be subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including our ability to predict the outcome of complex research  competition from other entities of which we may become aware in future periods  predictions of market potential from products that may be derived from our research 
table of contents and development efforts and our ability to recruit and retain personnel with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform the required research activities 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenue revenue increased million or in compared to we attribute this increase primarily to recording million we received as a lump sum payment from a third party to fully satisfy monies due for certain patent interests as well as recording a full year of hycor s diagnostics revenue of million during as compared to only recording seven months of diagnostics sales of million during excluding the effect from the non recurring settlement and the increase due to a full twelve months of revenue from hycor  sales increased over the comparable period 
also contributing to the growth were increased sales in qpcr and mutagenesis product sales of million offset by declines in older technology products of million 
the strengthening foreign exchange value of the dollar also affected sales in resulting in a negative foreign exchange impact to foreign sales of million for a decrease to total worldwide revenue when compared to we expect that future revenue will depend on a number of factors  including the market acceptance of new products  competitive conditions  currency fluctuations and the continued funding of customer research budgets 
the lump sum payment we received was made pursuant to a settlement agreement by which the parties settled certain patent related matters 
the technology owned by certain patent owners  including us  relates to a collaboration between abbott and cambridge antibody technology for the development of humira for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
the first commercial sales of this product occurred in we agreed to a lump sum payment to satisfy in full their interest with respect to the humira collaboration 
we also have the right to realize approximately million during the years to if commercial sales of humira are continuing 
in addition to the settlement of the obligations related to humira  the parties agreed to a decreased royalty rate on abbott s other fully human antibody that neutralizes human il  which was also developed in collaboration with cambridge antibody technology 
this antibody is referenced as abt by abbott and is in phase ii drug trials 
we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of income that we may realize as a result of commercialization of this product in the future 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  due to recording the net effect of the million royalty related to the cambridge antibody technology settlement offset by a million cat royalty obligation due to an unrelated third party  as well as recording a full year of hycor s results of operations for the twelve months ended december  as compared to recording seven months of hycor s results of operations for the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   we also recorded less royalty expense on product sales due to the expiration of certain patents held by a third party 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit remained relatively constant at for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the twelve months ended december  research and development research and development expenses increased million or for the twelve months ended as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase is due to including a full year of hycor s diagnostic research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to including seven months of hycor s expense for the twelve months ended december  the increased spending was also a result of increased research and development activities in molecular diagnostics and software solutions 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses decreased from in to in as a result of recognizing higher revenue during the twelve months ended 
table of contents december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  we intend to spend between and of total revenues on research and development for at least the next few years in an effort to accelerate new product introductions 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased million or for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in spending was partially due to including twelve months of hycor s selling and marketing expenses in as compared to including seven months of hycor s selling and marketing expense in resulting in million of the increase

we also incurred increased general and administrative expense due to including hycor s results for the full twelve months ended december  as compared to including only seven months of hycor s results for the twelve months ended december  resulting in million of the increase 
this increased spending was partially offset by million in expense related to bonuses paid to our ceo in connection with the hycor merger for the twelve months ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in due to the increased revenue recognized during as compared to litigation charge during the fourth quarter of  we accrued million in expense for the judgment awarded in the third wave technologies vs 
stratagene patent infringement matter 
this amount includes total damages of million  attorneys fees and costs of million  and pre judgment interest of million 
in considering whether to record a loss contingency  we considered the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we have now appealed the district court judgment to the federal circuit court of appeals  we have accrued million  as we believe that we have met the conditions for accrual as stated in fasb statement no 
post judgment interest at the rate of approximately compounded annually remains in effect and unpaid unless the judgment is reversed 
see item legal proceedings 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets decreased by approximately  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this expense relates to writing off the remaining unamortized balances of patents that we believe are not recoverable 
other income and expenses total other expense  net of income  remained relatively constant for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  fluctuations within other income and expense included a decrease in income for the twelve months ended december  due to a million gain recorded in equity in earnings of a joint venture  which was not repeated in

prior to the bch asset acquisition date  stratagene and bch presented their financial statements on a combined basis as a result of being under common control and because certain stratagene shareholders held substantially all the bch membership units 
bch consisted substantially of limited liability companies that were treated as partnerships for income tax purposes  therefore  any related income tax liabilities were the responsibility of the members of bch 
as a result  the operations of bch did not reflect a provision for income taxes prior to the acquisition date 
the income taxes attributable to the million gain are the responsibility of the members of bch and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements do not include a provision for income taxes on this gain 
on february   we dissolved bch 
for the twelve months ended december   we reversed approximately  of tax reserves due to the completion of an irs review of our and federal tax returns 
as a result  all reserves pertaining to these tax years were no longer necessary 
we recognize state research and development and other credits when we generate them 
we recognize excess credits for mature operating entities and we will use these excess credits to offset future taxable income  as we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the credits 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  total revenue revenue increased million or in compared to we attribute this increase primarily to recording seven months of hycor s diagnostics revenue of million as a result of the merger on june  also contributing to the growth were increased sales in qpcr  mutagenesis and bioinformatics product sales of million offset by declines in older technology products of million 
the weakening dollar affected sales in resulting in a positive foreign exchange impact to foreign sales of million  or  and a increase to total worldwide revenue when compared to gross margin gross margin decreased from in to in primarily due to the blending of the lower margin diagnostic products as a result of the merger with hycor 
research and development research and development expenses increased million or in compared to this increase was due to incurring seven months of clinical diagnostics research and development expenses of million as a result of the merger with hycor  offset by decreased research supplies research and development expense of million due to transitioning the mx effort from research and development to manufacturing in the third quarter of as well as canceling certain research and development efforts

in return  we received cash consideration of approximately million and recorded a non operating loss of approximately million for the difference between the carrying basis in the entity on december  and the consideration received 
as a result of the redemption transaction  we have rights to additional amounts realized by the lp from future royalty streams and future clinical trial revenues 
we will record these amounts as other non operating income in future periods when we know the amounts and we are assured of collection 
also contributing to the net increase of other income was a reduction in interest expense of million in compared to resulting from the repayment of long term debt obligations as well as the refinancing of our debt obligations in the first quarter of  which reduced the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings

non deductible foreign entity losses  for which the company has established valuation allowances due to the uncertainty of recovery of these foreign net operating losses  offset the change in the effective tax rate 
on february   we dissolved bch 
we recognize state research and development and other credits when we generated them 
we recognize excess credits for mature operating entities and we will use these excess credits to offset future taxable income  as we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the credits 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted of research and development expenses  selling and marketing expenses  debt service  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes

the actual write off for the years ended december  and was minimal and the allowance decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
this decrease in expected uncollectible accounts was due in part to continued collection efforts 
no significant change to future liquidity is anticipated

as of december   biocrest manufacturing  lp  our consolidated subsidiary  had approximately million in total debt  which relates to industrial revenue bonds 
the obligations of biocrest manufacturing  lp under the reducing revolving line of credit have been guaranteed by us and each of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
the obligation is also generally secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and each of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  as well as liens on the real property and improvements related to our texas manufacturing facility 
the reducing revolving line of credit is also secured by a pledge of our interest in iobion informatics  llc 
borrowings under the reducing revolving line of credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to the one month libor rate plus  and the reducing revolving line of credit under the original credit facility agreement matures in january in january  we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement  which provided for the extension of the reducing revolving line of credit to july the reducing revolving line of credit includes customary but significant restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  the payment of dividends  acquisitions and capital expenditures above stated limits 
the reducing revolving line of credit also contains restrictive covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios  including minimum debt service coverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios and tangible net worth 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under this line of credit  which was paid off on january  as of december   we would not have been in compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio as a result of an increase in our estimated income tax payments related to receiving approximately million before taxes for royalties related to a settlement with cambridge antibody technology 
however  we completed an amendment to the credit agreement in january  which cured the potential violation 
we were in compliance with all other covenants at december  
table of contents the industrial revenue bonds are secured by land  building and equipment acquired in bastrop county  texas with the proceeds from the issuance of the bonds 
the average interest rate on the industrial revenue bonds was and for the years ended december  and  respectively

on january  and in relation to the jury verdict of trebled damages of million plus reimbursement of attorney s fees and costs of million and pre judgment interest of million in the third wave litigation  the total of which is million with post judgment interest accruing at an annual percentage rate of approximately  we posted a million surety bond in order to permit us to appeal such decision without being subject to collection activities by third wave 
the cost of such surety bond was  and the bond is secured by a million of cash  which is being held in an interest bearing restricted account 
if we are ultimately required to pay out all or a portion of the million upon an adverse judgment rendered by the court and affirmed on appeal  it would negatively impact our cash position 
we currently have the ability to pay such damage award with our existing cash resources 
during the fourth quarter of  our cash position was positively impacted by receiving approximately million before taxes for royalties related to the cambridge antibody technology settlement 
we used a portion of these funds to pay a special one time cash dividend of per common share payable on january  to stockholders of record as of december   which amounted to approximately million
