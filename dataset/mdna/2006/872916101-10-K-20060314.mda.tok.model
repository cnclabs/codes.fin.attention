item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
overview we are a global supplier of rapidly deployable first receiver and first responder systems for homeland security  hospitals  police and fire departments  the military and public health agencies 
we design  fabricate and market products and systems both through distributors and directly to end users and oems 
these shelter systems include chemical and biological decontamination systems  hospital surge capacity systems  and infection control systems  all of which integrate our fabric shelter structure 
many of these shelter systems employ our proprietary articulating frame 
we also sell a line of powered air purifying respirators paprs as well as thermal products  which include targets  identification friend or foe iff devices  helicopter landing systems  markers and decoys 
in addition  we plan to manufacture disposable filter canisters for the first responder  military  healthcare and industrial markets 
we are in the process of establishing the only high capacity filter canister manufacturing facility located in the united states 
finally  in  we introduced training services as part of our business and plan to pursue training services as a compliment to our core business 
the first receiver and first responder markets have increased significantly in terms of size and demand over the past few years at all levels of government 
our strategy is to grow by expanding our product offerings to capitalize on the demand of these first receiver and first responder markets  primarily within the homeland security sector 
we plan to diversify our product offerings both by organic development of new products and through acquisitions 
our continually increasing commitment to r d is a key component of our diversification strategy to address the operating requirements of our target markets 
in  therefore  we continued to invest significantly in r d activities  and the continued development of our filter canister manufacturing line 
in connection with our acquisition of sti  we entered into an exclusive r d arrangement with safety tech ag  which has historically performed sti s r d function for its papr systems 
most of our efforts are directed toward the realization of products with near term revenue potential  but we continue to invest in r d initiatives to ensure our continued competitiveness in the more distant future 
our most significant expense is cost of goods sold  which consists primarily of direct labor  raw materials and manufacturing overhead costs incurred in the manufacture of our products 
during  we continued to monitor our cash position and  at the end of  entered into a million revolving credit facility with bank of america 
as of march  we have not drawn down any funds from the facility 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million 
in addition  investment in marketable securities as of december  was million 
we used approximately million in cash in connection with our acquisition of sti and intend to use additional cash and issue shares of our common stock to implement our growth strategy

international sales decreased to approximately million in from million in gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percent of sales was for compared with for the increase in the gross margin percentage is primarily related to improved productivity  a change in our product mix and improvement in warranty costs of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  as a percent of sales  sg a increased to for compared to for the increase is primarily attributable to increased expenses related to sarbanes oxley regulatory compliance as well as expenses attributable to other legal and corporate governance matters 

table of contents research and development our r d expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  our r d expense represents activity focused on the improvement and maintenance of our existing products  developing new uses and applications for our existing products  and the development of new products  particularly in the area of thermal marking infra red  infection control and papr technology 
many of these r d activities are continued r d initiatives started in operating income operating income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ending december  primarily due to the increase in sg a expenses 
income tax the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the effective tax rate eft for was  compared to for the increase in the eft for compared with the prior year is primarily attributable to the reduction of the extraterritorial deduction due to our decrease in international sales and a million payment related to an irs audit of our year  offset slightly by a newly available manufacturing deduction 
net income net income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year as a result of the factors discussed above 
earnings per diluted share were for the year ended december   compared with for the prior year 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the sales increase primarily related to an increase in domestic decontamination sales 
international sales decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year  which was largely comprised of sales in the united kingdom  or the uk  to her majesty s fire service through our uk distributor 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percent of sales was for the year ended december  compared with for the prior year 
the decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributed to the allocation of costs of sales of certain facilities  and occupancy and insurance expenses  which in were charged to sg a expenses  and the incorporation of capa into our operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the year ended december  as a percent of sales  sg a declined to for the year ended 
table of contents december  from for the prior year 
a significant amount of the year over year dollar increase was attributable to an increase in sales related expenses  such as trade shows  advertising  marketing  sales expenses and employee related costs to support sales growth and expanded product lines 
the aforementioned allocation to costs of sales of certain facilities  occupancy and insurance expenses would have decreased the sg a expense for the year ended december  research and development r d expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  this increase was necessary to support our strategic product development objectives and overall growth strategies that continued into due to the significance and magnitude of these initiatives and their related costs  and in order to provide clear and meaningful disclosure  in we separated r d expenses and reported them separately from sg a expenses 
operating income operating income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily due to the increase in r d expenses

the eft for was  compared with for the increase in the eft for compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to a decline in the extraterritorial deduction to million for from million for  as our export sales declined 
net income net income increased million  or  to million for from million for  primarily reflecting the growth in operating earnings attributable to higher net sales 
earnings per diluted share was for the year ended december   compared with for liquidity and capital resources management measures our liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operational funding needs and fund additional investments  including acquisitions 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital under satisfactory terms 
strong internal cash generation  together with currently available cash and investments and an ability to access credit lines if needed  are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and any increase in working capital that we would need to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we are actively seeking to expand by acquisitions as well as through organic growth of our business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional borrowings  equity financing or both  we believe that we would be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms based  among other things  on our earnings performance and current financial position 
as of december  working capital was million  down from the million at december  cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  totaled million  a decrease of from december  working capital changes are primarily attributable to the acquisition 
table of contents of sti which used cash of million and increased accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
during the first quarter of  we implemented an enhanced cash management program to achieve higher yields on our cash 
under this program  we may invest in us treasury  corporate commercial paper and other interest bearing securities with various maturities 
accounts receivable as of december  was million  an increase of from december  days sales outstanding  or dso  as of december  was compared to days as of december  the increase in accounts receivable and dso is primarily attributable to our acquisition of sti  which added million in receivables  coupled with some delays in collections related to katrina hurricane support 
much of the significant sti receivables and delayed collections related to katrina support were received within the first days of we do not  therefore  believe that the increase in accounts receivable or dso as of december  compared to accounts receivable and dso as of december   respectively  represents a trend of slower collections 
inventory as of december  was million  an increase of from december  annualized inventory turnover was times at december  compared to times at december  the increase in inventory and the related inventory turnover reduction are attributable to our acquisition of sti  coupled with some raw materials additions to fulfill future orders 
accounts payable as of december  was million  an increase of from december  this increase was attributable to the acquisition of sti  inventory purchases and business insurance renewals at the end of cash flow from operating activities was million for the year ended december   down from million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities totaled million for  including million for the purchase of marketable securities  million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  primarily related to the new filter canister manufacturing line and other product expansion initiatives  million for the purchase of intangible assets  and million for the acquisition of sti 
construction of the filter canister manufacturing line is nearing completion  however  operation of the line remains subject to niosh regulatory approval 
in connection with the acquisition of sti  additional earnout consideration may be payable should certain conditions be met by sti s operations  including the generation of certain income amounts by sti in the fiscal years ending june  and the maximum amount of earnout payments would be million  payable in cash and in the form of restricted common stock 
in december  tvi and its three subsidiaries entered into a credit and security agreement and related agreements the credit agreement with bank of america  na bank 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility credit facility in the maximum principal amount of million 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to libor plus a stated margin of between and based upon the ratio of tvi s total funded debt to ebitda the ebitda ratio 
the credit agreement also provides that the bank will issue or commit to issue letters of credit for our account in aggregate undrawn amounts of up to million 
annual fees for letters of credit issued for our account will equal to of the face amount of such letters of credit based upon the ebitda ratio 
the amount of any outstanding letters of credit issued or committed to be issued by the bank will reduce  dollar for dollar  the aggregate amount available under the credit facility 
we must also pay a commitment fee equal to an annual rate of or of the unused facility  which rate is based on our ebitda ratio at the time such fee is due  times the amount of the unused facility 
the obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in all of the personal property of tvi and its subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants that will  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends  make certain types of investments  enter into certain types of 
table of contents transactions with affiliates  make certain capital expenditures  sell assets  merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside of the ordinary course of business 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain an ebitda ratio of to or less on a rolling calendar quarter basis 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including  but not limited to a non payment of amounts due  b material breach of representations  warranties or covenants under the credit agreement or the documents pertaining thereto  c cross default provisions relating to other indebtedness obligations  d loss of collateral  e bankruptcy or similar proceedings  f dissolution  or g other certain material adverse changes 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable and the bank may exercise other remedies available to it under the credit agreement  including without limitation  exercising its rights in the collateral 
the credit facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on december  as of march   tvi had not requested any advances under the credit facility and had not requested any commitments from boa to issue letters of credit 
the credit agreement provides that advances under the credit facility can be used only for working capital purposes  to make capital expenditures and to finance acquisitions 
we entered into the credit facility to provide an alternative source of liquidity  if needed  which may include being a source of capital for strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets 
we believe that the cash balance as of march  along with anticipated internally generated funds and the available line of credit will be sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that we have adequate production equipment to support our current level of operations 
we spent million on plant and equipment in and million in  which was paid from funds generated from operations 
these and purchases primarily related to the new filter canister manufacturing line and other product expansion initiatives 
we will invest in additional equipment to meet efficiency and delivery requirements should our production levels increase significantly 
we currently intend to purchase any such equipment from operating funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet obligations our disclosures regarding contractual obligations and commercial commitments are located in various parts of our regulatory filings 
information in the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations contractual cash obligations as of december   operating lease obligations include future payments related to accrued lease costs of which are included in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet 
as of december   purchase obligations consist of purchases of inventory and equipment in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  research and development  intangible assets  credit sales and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
changes in estimates and assumptions used by management could have a significant impact on our financial results and actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales when the risks and rewards of ownership pass to customers  which may either be at the time of shipment or upon delivery or acceptance by the customer  depending on the terms of the sale 
we record sales discounts and allowances in the period in which the sale occurs 
inventory valuation we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
such evaluation is based on management s judgment and use of estimates  including sales forecasts  historical usage  planned dispositions of materials  product lines  technological events and trends 
in addition  the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of disposing of excess inventory 
excess inventory is generally identified by comparing historical and future expected inventory usage to actual on hand quantities 
reserves are provided for on hand inventory in excess of pre defined usage forecasts 
forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical actual inventory usage levels forward to future periods 
credit and collections we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable in order to reflect the potential uncollectibility of receivables related to purchases of products on open credit 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make required payments  we may be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
contingent liabilities we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  warranty and other claims or uncertainties related to environmental  legal  product and other matters 
we routinely assess the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments 
research and development r d costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs include direct labor and materials as well as a reasonable allocation of overhead costs 
however  no sg a costs are included 
equipment which has alternative future uses is capitalized and charged to expense over its estimated useful life 
goodwill and other intangible assets business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
we have 
table of contents adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 which requires that we  on an annual basis  calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and other intangible assets and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
because of the integral technologies and operations of the acquisitions  during we had only one corporate wide reporting entity to which this test applies 
business combination we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
external costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while internal costs incurred by us for acquisition opportunities are expensed 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and it supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
sfas r does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans  which are subject to aicpa statement of position  employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
sfas r requires companies to measure compensation expense for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value and recognize the expense over the related service period 
additionally  excess tax benefits  as defined in sfas r  will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital and will be reclassified from operating cash flows to financing cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
we will transition to fair value based accounting for stock based compensation using a modified version of prospective application modified prospective application 
under the modified prospective application  as it is applicable to us  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered generally referring to non vested awards that are outstanding as of january  must be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered during the period of  or the periods after  adoption of sfas r 
the attribution of compensation cost for those earlier awards will be based on the same method and on the same grant date fair values previously determined for the pro forma disclosures provided by us in our consolidated financial statements 
upon transitioning to sfas no 
r in january using the modified prospective method  we do not anticipate recognizing a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  however  we do anticipate 
table of contents recognizing compensation expense in in the aggregate amount of approximately million for all share based payment awards granted prior to january  that remain unvested as of january  sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had no variable rate debt outstanding as of december
