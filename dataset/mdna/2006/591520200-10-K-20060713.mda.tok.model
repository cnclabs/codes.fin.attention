item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global manufacturer of component and subsystem devices with manufacturing  design and testing facilities in the united states  malta  mexico  united kingdom  germany  czech republic  and china 
we design  manufacture and market devices employing electrical  electronic  wireless  sensing and optical technologies 
our business is managed on a segment basis  with those segments being automotive  interconnect  power distribution and other 
for more information regarding the business and products of these segments  see item business 

table of contents our components are found in the primary end markets of the automotive  communications including information processing and storage  networking equipment  wireless and terrestrial voice data systems  aerospace  rail and other transportation industries  and the consumer and industrial equipment markets 
recent trends in the industries that we serve include continued customer migration to low cost eastern european and asian suppliers  growth of north american subsidiaries of foreign based automobile manufacturers  rising raw material costs  the deteriorating financial condition of certain of our customers and the uncertainty as they undergo restructuring initiatives  including in some cases  reorganization under bankruptcy laws  increasing pressure by automobile manufacturers on automotive suppliers to reduce selling prices  more supplier funded design  engineering and tooling costs previously funded directly by the automobile manufacturers  reduced production schedules for domestic automobile manufacturers  and rising interest rates 
in response to pricing pressures  we continue to transition to lean manufacturing processes and invest in  and implement techniques  such as flexible automated manufacturing cells  to lower our costs in order to reduce or prevent margin erosion 
we also have become more selective with regard to programs in which we participate in order to reduce our exposure to low profit programs  and have transferred several automotive lines and identified additional lines to be transferred from the us to low cost countries 
our transition to lean manufacturing has helped us obtain our first contract with american honda motor co  inc to supply components  which we began manufacturing in fiscal in an effort to better compete with low cost manufacturers and expand our business in the asian marketplace  we transferred production from our singapore facility to our shanghai  china plant in fiscal we have added another facility in shanghai to manufacture bus bar products  which began shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal on october   a major customer  delphi corporation and its us subsidiaries delphi filed chapter petitions for bankruptcy 
as of the bankruptcy filing date  we had approximately million of accounts receivable from delphi and an intangible asset on our balance sheet of approximately million relating to our delphi supply agreement 
we recorded a bad debt provision of million in fiscal for delphi receivables deemed uncollectible as a result of the bankruptcy filing 
in may  we sold million of our claims against delphi for their adjusted value 
we continue to supply product to delphi post petition pursuant to the supply agreement and do not consider the value of the supply agreement to be impaired 
in june  we entered a license agreement with immersion technologies to license a broad range of immersion s touchsense technology 
during the same month  we entered an agreement to license organic light emitting diode technology 
our global engineering teams are working to use these technologies to develop methode rotary control  joystick  touch screen  and touch surface products with programmable touch feedback  known as haptics 
these products will provide a broad spectrum of touch sensations to help inform the user  reduce distraction in the automobile  and improve the precision and speed of control in a variety of applications 
in march  we acquired the assets of cableco technologies corporation cableco  a designer and manufacturer of high current  flexible cabling systems for electronic and electrical applications 
the acquisition enhances our existing power distribution business  by bringing a complementary product portfolio and diverse customer base within the computer  telecommunication  medical and military markets and enables us to provide a more complete product offering to our customers 
we have transferred the majority of cableco s manufacturing operations to our facility in reynosa  mexico 
on january   in order to eliminate our dual class stock structure  we completed a merger whereby all of our outstanding class b common stock was converted into the right to receive per share in cash and each share of our class a common stock was converted into one share of new common stock see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents business outlook sales in fiscal are expected to increase modestly compared to fiscal we anticipate continued growth in power distribution products with additional increases coming from asia as well as the joint marketing capability gained from the cableco acquisition 
sales of automotive products at our shanghai  china facility are expected to increase dramatically from start up volumes in  and we also anticipate increased sales of automotive switches at our malta operation 
these increases will be significantly offset by negotiated price reductions and forecasted lower sales from methode s traditional north american automotive oems along with the company s continued transition away from less profitable programs 
sales of sensor pads for passive occupant detection systems are expected to level off  as the federal requirement to provide passive occupant detection for front passenger airbag deployment on all vehicles became fully effective for the model year and beyond 
in fiscal  methode will incur increased expense for the amortization of stock based compensation awards 
in response to competitive pressures from manufacturers in low cost countries  and as part of our continuing focus to improve costs and worldwide efficiencies  we expect to reorganize portions of our business in the fiscal year 
such reorganization may include plant closings and involuntary employee terminations and could result in charges to earnings ranging from to per share 
the majority of the charges would be classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income and will not require material outlays of cash 
actual results and outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted

the balance of the sales increase in this segment was due to increased demand for our bus bar products for computer peripheral and locomotive applications 
other segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with in the previous fiscal year 
net sales of the other segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales increases experienced by our test laboratories in were primarily the result of an increased market demand for testing services  enhanced by the expansion of our service offerings to include x ray analysis and water testing 
other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from our automotive joint venture  license fees  royalties  and engineering design fees 
the decrease in other income was primarily due to a decrease in design fees earned in fiscal cost of products sold

production inefficiencies  and new product launch issues experienced at our scotland and shanghai manufacturing facilities were major contributors to the margin decline 
gross margins on net sales of the interconnect segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal completion of the transfer of our singapore connector manufacturing operation to shanghai and benefits from our lean manufacturing initiatives at several of our interconnect manufacturing facilities were primarily responsible for the margin improvement 

table of contents gross margins of the power distribution segment decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the margin decline was due to costs associated with the integration of the cableco acquisition and the transfer of its manufacturing to our facility in mexico  and start up costs associated with establishing bus bar manufacturing in shanghai 
gross margins of the other segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the test laboratories experienced a margin increase to in from in  primarily due to an increase in sales volume 
the torque sensing operation has not yet begun to manufacture in significant volumes and experienced negative gross margins in both and selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in both fiscal and fiscal fiscal includes a million bad debt provision for receivables deemed to be uncollectible due to the chapter bankruptcy filing by delphi corporation and its us subsidiaries

amortization of intangibles relates to intangible assets acquired by the company in connection with various business acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates 
other  net 
the balance of other  net consists primarily of currency exchange gains and losses at our foreign subsidiaries 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are the maltese lira  euro  singapore dollar  british pound  chinese yuan  mexican peso and czech koruna 
the foreign subsidiaries have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies  primarily sales in us dollars  creating exchange rate sensitivities

table of contents interconnect segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the net effect of the increase in customer paid tooling and foreign currency translation increased our net sales for this segment by 
we had strong sales increases of our copper transceiver  which enables high speed gigabit data transfers over existing copper infrastructure 
net sales also increased significantly at our domestic subsidiary that provides custom installation of fiber optic cable assemblies primarily to data centers 
the sales increase at this business unit was attributable to general market improvement 
lost sales due to the closing of our fiber optic operation in the united kingdom at the end of fiscal were largely offset by sales of million related to a one time project by our czech republic fiber optic operation in fiscal the balance of the interconnect segment experienced sales declines or only modest sales gains in fiscal  largely due to competitive pressures from low cost eastern european and asian manufacturers 
the closing of our manufacturing operation in ireland in the third quarter of fiscal had a negative impact on year over year net sales comparisons see note to the consolidated financial statements 
power distribution segment net sales represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal compared with in fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the sales increase in this segment was due to new bus bar product shipments and an expanded customer base for these products

other income 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from our automotive joint venture  license fees  royalties  and engineering design fees 
the decrease in other income was primarily due to a decrease in design fees earned in fiscal earnings from our automotive joint venture are also declining as the operation winds down towards its scheduled end of life 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal compared with in fiscal the impact of customer paid tooling sales  which are intended to reimburse the company for the cost of customer owned tooling used by the company to manufacture product for the customer  increased the cost of sales percentage by in fiscal and in gross margins on product sales of the automotive segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal strong sales gains of pods sensor pads and automotive switch sales in europe contributed to the margin gain during fiscal benefits from our lean manufacturing initiatives helped to reduce the negative margin impact of production volume declines and price reductions on sales to our traditional north american automotive customers in fiscal fiscal gross margins were unfavorably impacted by a disruption in production at our scotland automotive plant due to a fire  and costs due to challenges in launching several new products that helped increase that facility s sales by in fiscal gross margins on net sales of the interconnect segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  our domestic subsidiary that provides custom installation of fiber optic cable assemblies began outsourcing the manufacturing of cable assemblies 
this outsourcing coupled with a increase in sales at this business unit contributed significantly to the margin improvement 
the closing of the cable assembly operation in ireland resulted in a million charge to cost of sales in and reduced the gross margin by in that year 
the divestiture of our fiber optic operation in the uk also contributed to the margin improvement 
the uk fiber optic unit s operations and costs associated with the divestiture reduced margins by in fiscal gross margins of the power distribution segment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the margin improvement on sales of power distribution products was primarily due to increased sales volumes  partially offset by integration costs associated with the acquisition of cableco 
gross margins of the other segment declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the test laboratories experienced a margin decline to in from in  primarily due to a reduction in

interest income  net of interest expense  increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates 
other  net 
in fiscal  other  net included million of income from life insurance proceeds from policies owned by the company in connection with an employee deferred compensation plan 
the balance of other  net consisted primarily of currency exchange gains and losses at our foreign subsidiaries 
the functional currencies of these subsidiaries are the maltese lira  euro  singapore dollar  british pound  chinese yuan and czech koruna 
the foreign subsidiaries have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies  primarily sales in us dollars  creating exchange rate sensitivities 
currency exchange losses of million and million were experienced by the company s foreign subsidiaries in fiscal and  respectively  as the result of a weak us dollar 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal the effective rate increased in primarily due to the change in mix of domestic and foreign taxable income and losses incurred in the uk and china for which no tax benefit could be recognized 
the effective rate in included a reduction for the tax exempt income from life insurance and the effective rates in both years reflect utilization of foreign investment tax credits and the effect of lower tax rates on income at our foreign operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our cash requirements through cash flows from operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our future net sales and the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
we believe our current cash balances together with the cash flow expected to be generated from future domestic and foreign operations will be sufficient to support current operations 
we have an agreement with our primary bank for a committed million revolving credit facility to provide ready financing for general corporate purposes  including acquisition opportunities that may become available 
the bank credit agreement requires maintenance of certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth level 
at april   the company was in compliance with these covenants and there were no borrowings against this credit facility 
net cash provided by operations was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary factor in the company s ability to generate cash from operations is its net income 
additionally  cash flows from operations exceed net income because non cash charges depreciation  provision for loss on accounts receivable from delphi  and amortization of intangibles and restricted stock awards negatively impact net income but do not result in the use of cash 
similarly  non cash credits such as deferred income tax benefits increase net income but do not provide cash 
additional offsets to cash flows from operations are working capital requirements that continue to be a use of cash from operations 
the reduction in cash provided by operations in was largely due to increased working capital requirements  primarily due to increased accounts receivables at our foreign subsidiaries  which are experiencing increased sales and generally have longer payment terms and inventories of customer tooling in process and a build up of plastic resin inventories acquired in

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we do not believe that it is reasonably likely that changes will occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales when i persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and iv collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
revenue from the company s product sales not requiring installation  net of trade discounts and estimated sales allowances  is recognized when title passes  which is upon shipment 
the company does not have any additional obligations or customer acceptance provisions after shipment of such products 
the company handles returns by replacing  repairing or issuing credit for defective products when returned 
revenue from cabling infrastructure systems installations is recognized when the installation is completed  tested and accepted by the customer 
revenue from customer tooling sales is recognized when the tooling is completed  producing production parts to specification  and accepted by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the creditworthiness of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our revenues and accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a deterioration in the economic environment or automotive industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 

table of contents allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by allowances for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowances are based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales  using assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on may  the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
the tax laws of malta provide for investment tax credits of of certain qualified expenditures 
unused credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have accumulated investment tax credits in excess of amounts more likely than not to be realized based upon projections of taxable income to be generated within a reasonable time period 
valuation allowances have been provided for this excess 
contingencies 
the company is subject to various investigations  claims  legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
for those matters that management can estimate a range of loss  we have established reserves at levels within that range to provide for the most likely scenario based upon available information 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assure that the company is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk certain of our foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our income before income taxes by million and million at april  and april   respectively 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  chinese yuan  czech koruna  euro  maltese lira  mexican peso and singapore dollar 
a change in foreign currency exchange rates from balance sheet date levels could impact our net foreign investments by million and million at april  and april   respectively
