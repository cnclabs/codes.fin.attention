item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
financial summary omi s revenue is derived from our investment in modern vessels used to provide seaborne transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in the international shipping markets 
our customers include major independent and state owned oil companies  major oil traders  government entities and various other entities 
we own or charter in a fleet of vessels see our fleet in the business section  item  including three newbuildings delivered and five vessels contracted for sale two bareboat chartered and one time chartered back in the first quarter of we will take delivery of two more newbuilding product carriers in the second quarter of we are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in two vessel types suezmax tankers  which generally carry crude oil we refer to these as our crude oil fleet or suezmax fleet from areas of oil production to refinery areas  and product carriers  which generally carry refined petroleum products which we refer to as our product carrier fleet  such as gasoline and aviation fuel  from refineries to distribution areas 
as of december   the average age of our vessels was years 
note all averages referring to vessel age are weighted averages based on deadweight tons dwt and are calculated as of december   based on our operating fleet of vessels 
dwt  expressed in metric tons each of which is equivalent to kilograms  refers to the total weight a vessel can carry when loaded to a particular load line 
during we increased our operating fleet with the delivery of seven newbuildings  two of which are chartered in  which is reflective of our commitment to our strategy of acquiring quality  modern vessels 
the following table illustrates highlights for the year ended december   in comparison to the years ended december  and highlights dollars in millions  shares in thousands  except per share data net income tce revenue basic earnings per common share weighted average shares outstanding basic dividends declared n a cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures for vessels and other property cash paid for repurchase of common stock see part ii  item selected financial data  note a for additional information of how the company uses tce revenue 
omi s net income and earnings per share for the year ended december  were the highest in the company s history 
consolidated tce revenue earned for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  although spot daily tce rates for the suezmax fleet were lower in compared to  see market overview for explanations of high rates in  there was a significant increase in operating days in due to the and acquisitions and deliveries of ships 
the following table has the average daily tce rates earned in the spot market for omi s suezmax vessels over the last five years 
the table illustrates the volatility and seasonality of rates 
suezmax fleet daily tce rate period twelve months     fourth quarter      third quarter      second quarter      first quarter      our company benefited from the continued strength of the tanker market during the year ended with a larger suezmax and product carrier fleet compared to last year 
we have also benefited from new time charter contracts for our product carriers that were higher than previous time charter contracts 
during  we spent million to increase the size of our fleet  and we repurchased  shares of omi s common stock which is of the common stock outstanding as of january  
we continued to pay a quarterly dividend  which was originally per share when declared in the first quarter of  and has increased to per share in the first quarter of in an effort to maintain our high quality vessel operations  we have implemented additional initiatives in that have resulted in increased operating costs see breakdown by fleet section 
we believe that the investment in high quality people operating the ships  appropriate stores and supplies to maintain the ships  training  environmental and other vessel related initiatives is necessary in order to be a high quality operator 
we also believe that our customers prefer omi because we are a quality operator 
we were able to continue long term relationships through time charter contracts renewed with existing customers  and we have formed new relationships due to the quality of our tonnage and operations 
omi s financial performance in resulted from the following key elements of our business strategy concentrate in two vessel categories suezmax tankers  which offer size advantages over aframaxes and panamaxes and geographic flexibility over vlccs  and product carriers  which provide an advantage because of increasing demand for petroleum products in areas where no additional refineries have recently been built 
our product carrier sizes allow us to participate in most trading areas and over the last few years we have accumulated twelve ice class product carriers  further expanding trading capabilities  maintain high quality vessels and standards of operation through improved environmental and safety procedures  crew training and maintenance and repair procedures  manage the balance between the ability to capture upside in stronger spot markets and the predictable revenues from long term contracts  which cover a large portion of fixed costs  maintain a balance between available liquidity to purchase vessels as market conditions and opportunities arise and maintaining prudent financial ratios eg leverage ratio  enter into strategic alliances and operate from geographic locations that provide us with market opportunities to improve our vessel utilization and earnings  and monitor and manage the repurchase of common stock 
we believe our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws 
to reduce our exposure  we seek to maintain standards and best practices to meet or exceed these laws and regulations 
we have an active safety and environment program and we use best practices to ensure our operations are conducted in a safe and ethical manner 
there are many factors that affect tanker rates  including supply and demand for vessels and the cargo that the vessels carry the supply demand for crude oil or refined products 
market conditions see market overview section and economic and regulatory changes also affect revenues and expenses 
the following are several key drivers for our revenues and operating income spot rates in the suezmax tanker market and product tanker market including vessels on time charters with profit sharing arrangements note for the next twelve months  we estimate a variation of  per day for vessels on spot would increase decrease net income by million or per share  per share from the product carrier fleet and per share from the suezmax fleet  the number of revenue earning operating days of our fleet  marketing our vessels by the formation of strategic alliances better scheduling of vessels and positioning  resulting in better utilization  capitalizing on our experience and reputation in the industry  and managing costs 
the company studies market indicators and trends when making decisions for managing risks  including but not limited to the following world oil demand increases decreases in consumption of oil  where the supply to meet the demand comes from long haul versus short haul voyages  world oil supply by geographic regions  inventory levels by geographic regions  world tanker newbuildings orderbook and deletions scrappings and conversions 
the following are several other significant events that occurred during the year ended december  and so far in the first quarter of increases in operating fleet by ten vessels in january  february and march  three product carrier newbuildings  two handymax the wabash and kansas and one handysize the rhine were delivered 
in january  march  may and july  five product carrier newbuildings  three handymax the lauren  the brazos and the thames and two handysize the tevere and the fox  were delivered 
in june and september  we time chartered in two built suezmax vessels the cape bonny and cape bastia 
disposition of seven vessels in march  we agreed to sell two suezmax vessels  the hudson and the potomac for a net sales price of million 
the potomac will be time chartered back to the company 
the vessels are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of the gain on the disposal of approximately million on the hudson will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income upon delivery and the gain of approximately million on the disposal of the potomac will be deferred and amortized over the five year lease term 
in february  we agreed to sell our built suezmax vessel  the sacramento for a net sales price of approximately million 
the vessel is expected to be delivered to the new owners in the second quarter of the gain on the disposal of approximately million will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income upon delivery 
in february  we agreed to sell two built panamax vessels  the ottawa and the tamar for an aggregate net sales price of approximately million 
the vessels are being leased back under bareboat charters we pay the vessel expenses for approximately four years each 
the gain on the disposals aggregating approximately million will be deferred and amortized over the lease term 
the vessels continue their current time charters  which expire in april and july  respectively 
in january  we sold our last two non double hull handysize crude oil carriers  which were built in  the tandjung ayu and bandar ayu  resulting in a gain on disposal of vessels of million 
in november  we sold two built suezmaxes  the pecos and the sabine  resulting in a gain on disposal of vessels of million 
time charter contacts see contracted time charter revenue section in march  omi entered into a three year time charter contract for a suezmax vessel  the cape bastia 
the vessel will be chartered at a fixed rate  and will add approximately million to the company s contracted time charter revenue over the three years 
in january and february  omi entered into three year time charter contracts for three handymax product carriers the kansas  the republican and the platte 
the time charters are expected to begin in the second quarter 
the charters will add approximately million to the company s contracted time charter revenue over the three year period  not including profit sharing arrangements for two of the vessels 
during  omi entered new or renewed time charters for handymax and handysize product carriers  each for a two or three year period  with the exception of one vessel for a one year period 
six of the vessels will begin their time charters in or after their current charter expires and the remaining began in all the time charters were at fixed rates and four have profit sharing arrangements 
during may  two suezmax tankers  the sacramento  now to be replaced by the max jacob  and the sabine  which was replaced by the potomac in october  began two seven year time charter contracts with profit sharing arrangements 
repurchase programs during the year ended december   we repurchased and retired  shares of common stock under board authorized programs  at an average price of per share  aggregating million 
having substantially completed board authorizations from  in february  the board authorized another million for the repurchase of its common stock 
omi currently has  shares outstanding

market overview tanker charter rates are determined in a highly competitive market and depend on the supply of and demand for tanker capacity 
demand for tankers depends primarily on the volume of crude oil and petroleum products transported as well as the distance over which they are carried 
such demand is a function of world economic conditions and the resulting need for oil  world oil production and consumption patterns  as well as events that interrupt oil production  trade routes and consumption 
the supply of tankers depends primarily on the level of the orderbook  the fleet age profile  government regulations that affect the level of tanker scrappings and the behavior of tanker users  as well as the operating efficiency of the existing fleet 
please see part i  item business section  for additional discussion of the tanker industry 
suezmax tanker overview the tanker market was strong in the fourth quarter of  and the average spot tce for suezmax tankers in the west africa to us trade was more than double the preceding quarterly rate but below the very high rate prevailing in the same period of last year 
in addition  the average suezmax tce rate in was the second highest for this period since at least this was the result of continued  although at a slower rate  world oil demand growth  colder than normal weather in the northern hemisphere and high opec oil production  notwithstanding an increase in the world tanker fleet 
freight rates in the crude oil tanker market continue at high levels thus far in the first quarter of opec crude oil production and suezmax tanker earnings 
c kxxjpg 
note as of source industry sources the average opec oil production in the fourth quarter of totaled about million barrels per day b d  about the same compared to the same period last year 
opec oil production  including iraq  in the first quarter of is expected to average million b d  about million b d below the preceding quarter and about million b d higher than the same period a year ago 
world oil demand in the fourth quarter of was million b d higher than the preceding quarter  and million b d higher compared to the same period of last year 
world oil demand is expected to increase further in the foreseeable future due to the usual seasonal oil demand gains in the winter months and further improvement of world economic activity 
world oil demand in increased at a slower rate than the prior year as a result of persistent high oil prices due to low spare oil production capacity  ongoing geopolitical risks and hurricane related oil production and refinery problems in the gulf of mexico 
in  hurricane activity resulted in shutdowns of most of the us crude oil production and refinery capacity in the gulf of mexico 
it is estimated that about million b d of crude oil production and about million b d of refinery capacity was out of service at year end and that about million b d of crude oil production and million b d of refinery capacity will still be out of service at the end of the first quarter of the refinery capacity is expected to be fully restored by the end of the second quarter  though crude oil production would be fully restored during the second half of total preliminary commercial crude oil and petroleum products inventories in the united states  western europe and japan at the end of january were about million barrels  or higher than the year earlier level  and above the average of the last five years 
at the same time  crude oil inventories were and petroleum products inventories were higher than the average of the last five years  respectively 
oil inventories in terms of days forward consumption throughout are expected to be higher than the level  as well as the average of the last five years

the tanker orderbook totaled about million dwt  or of the existing fleet at the end of approximately million dwt are for delivery in  million dwt in  million dwt in and most of the balance in the tanker orderbook includes suezmaxes of about million dwt or of the existing internationally trading suezmax tanker fleet 
twenty one suezmaxes are for delivery in  in  in and the balance in the suezmax orderbook for delivery in the next few years represents vessels to replace old tonnage affected by imo regulations as well as to satisfy an expected increase in demand 
it should be noted that more trades suitable for suezmaxes are developing and that suezmax tankers are flexible vessels since they are traded effectively in medium and long haul trades 
at the end of  approximately million dwt or of the total tanker fleet was or more years old  including million dwt or of the fleet that was or more years old 
furthermore  nine suezmaxes were or more years old  including two that were or more years old 
tanker sales for scrap and for floating production storage offloading fpso conversion totaled about million dwt in  including six suezmaxes and six very large crude carriers vlcc 
the eu adopted tanker regulations that commenced on october  in response to the eu regulations  the imo adopted new strict tanker regulations that commenced on april  these regulations primarily prevent single hull tankers of  dwt and above from carrying heavy fuel oil from early april  accelerate the phase out of single hull tankers to  in line with eu rules  and force all single hull tankers to comply with the condition assessment scheme cas from the age of years  commencing in however  it allows flag states to permit single hull tankers with segregated ballast sbt and smaller tankers to operate beyond  but the tanker must not be in operation beyond the date of delivery in or the date in which the tanker becomes years old  whichever is earlier  subject to satisfactory results from cas 
finally  tankers with only double sides or double bottoms will be allowed to operate beyond  provided that these tankers were in service on july  such tankers will not be allowed to operate beyond the date on which they become years old after the date of delivery 
at the end of  there were about million dwt of tankers or of the total tanker fleet that will be affected by these regulations 
product tanker overview the strong freight rate environment of the product tanker market continued throughout and  in the fourth quarter  the average spot tce for handysize product tankers in the caribbean was higher than the preceding quarter rate but below the very high rate prevailing in the same period of last year 
in addition  the average rate in was the second highest level since at least the product tanker market strength was the result of continuous growth in the demand for oil  shortage of refinery capacity in consuming areas and the substantial loss of us refinery capacity in the gulf of mexico due to hurricane activity during  notwithstanding an increase of the world product tanker fleet 
freight rates in the product tanker market continue to be strong thus far in the first quarter of the world product tanker fleet which ranges from small  dwt product carriers to larger than  dwt for coated aframax tankers  totaled about million dwt at the end of  up by about from the year end level

critical accounting estimates the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we make estimates  judgments  assumptions and form opinions in applying our accounting policies that significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue expense recognition for voyage charters  evaluation for impairment of long lived assets  depreciation expense and drydock amortization because they generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are complicated or subjective 
revenue and expense recognition omi generates operating revenue from two types of charters  time charters and voyage charters 
time charters are for a specific period of time at a specific rate per day or month and are generally not as complex or as subjective as voyage charters 
under a voyage charter also called a spot market charter  we agree to provide a vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for our account 
voyage expenses  such as fuel and port charges  are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage 
we recognize voyage revenue and voyage expenses on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenue and expenses in the shipping industry 
estimated losses under a voyage charter are provided for in full at the time such losses become evident 
revenue recognition for voyage charters may be calculated on either a load to load basis or on a discharge to discharge basis 
our accounting policy for recognition of voyage freight for vessels operating on voyage charters is on the discharge to discharge basis  which is consistent with accounting requirements and industry practice 
under this method  voyage revenue is recognized evenly over the period from the discharge of cargo for the prior voyage to the discharge of cargo for the current voyage 
management believes that the discharge to discharge method is preferable because it eliminates the uncertainty associated with the location of the next load port 
this is the predominant method in the industry 
management uses judgment to estimate the number of days of a voyage to compute the amount of revenue and expense to recognize at the end of each month using the percentage of completion method on a discharge to discharge basis 
these estimates are generally supported by historical trends  more specifically about the operating capability of the vessel speed and fuel consumption and the trading route 
actual results could differ from the estimated accruals in the consolidated balance sheets under the classifications traffic receivables  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued voyage and vessel liabilities  and also under voyage revenue and voyage expense categories included in the consolidated statements of income 
collection of voyage revenue or freight and time charter revenue are reasonably assured and our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in traffic receivables in the consolidated balance sheets  associated with such revenue is insignificant 
demurrage income  included in voyage revenue  represents earnings from payments by the charterer to the vessel owner when loading and discharging time exceed the stipulated time in the voyage charter 
demurrage income is measured in accordance with the provisions of the respective charter agreements and the circumstances under which demurrage claims arise  and it is also recognized when earned ratably over the estimated duration of the voyage to which it pertains 
we also provide a reserve for our demurrage revenues based upon our historical record of collecting these amounts 
as of december   the demurrage receivable included in traffic receivables in the consolidated balance sheets was million  net of million  which was the portion of reserve for demurrage 
in  we reduced our reserve for demurrage claims by approximately million because of our history of collections 
we periodically review the adequacy of this reserve so that it properly reflects our collection 
actual results could differ from estimated reserves that are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the classifications traffic receivables and also under the voyage revenue category included in the consolidated statements of income that are estimates in a period 
evaluation for impairments on long lived assets vessels and construction in progress cip payments are recorded at cost 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and minor renewals are expensed 
major replacements and renewals are capitalized 
the carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of secondhand vessels have been historically cyclical and tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
management reviews vessels for potential impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their values may have declined 
in order to evaluate impairment of a vessel  assumptions about the future condition of the vessel and its operations are made 
these assumptions are applied in a model in which we estimate the undiscounted projected future cash flows associated with the vessel and comparisons to the vessel s carrying value to determine if a writedown to fair value is required 
this process involves subjective assumptions about future events  and discount factors to be applied to projected cash flows when it is determined that an impairment existed 
estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company s control such as the overall market and economic trends  new regulations  and other changes 
these factors can cause underperformance relative to expected operating results and impact the useful economic lives of the vessels 
consideration  evaluation and judgments are made for each of these factors when making assumptions about the future performance for each vessel 
there were no circumstances or events during the year ended december  that would indicate to management that impairment existed 
carrying values at december  were determined to be appropriate and reasonable 
however  if circumstances or events affecting these assumptions change  it could result in impairment charges in future periods that may be material 
during and  laws and regulations were adopted by the eu which commenced in and by the imo which commenced in 
these rules and regulations phase out non double hull tankers at different periods from opa currently  we only have double hull vessels  therefore  our ships do not have issues of this nature relating to their trading 
see the market overview section for more details about the impact of the latest laws and regulations 
depreciation expense depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided on the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets up to the assets estimated salvage value 
we estimate the useful lives of our vessels to be approximately years 
management s judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
capital expenditures on our vessels relating to significant replacements  improvements or new equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the capitalized asset or the remaining life of the vessel 
capital expenditures under our policy are based on management s judgment required to determine if such expenditure extends the useful life of the vessel  increases operational efficiency or satisfies current safety and environmental requirements 
salvage  or scrap value  is based upon a vessel s lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate 
we use a scrap rate of per lwt  which is in line with industry standards  to compute each vessel s salvage value 
the estimated scrap value is used in the computation of depreciation expense and recoverability of the carrying value of each vessel when evaluating for impairment of vessels 
management s estimates for salvage values may differ from actual results 
drydock amortization the company uses the deferred method of accounting for drydock expenses that is consistent with accounting requirements and industry practice 
under the deferred method  drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized until the next drydock or special survey  which we estimate to be approximately a two year period 
management believes the deferred method better matches costs with revenue and best matches the economics 
management uses judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense 
if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock  the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written off as a component of the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels 
our drydock amortization expense was million in this expense is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the deferred drydock balance at december  on the consolidated balance sheets of million represents unamortized deferred drydock balances for of our wholly owned vessels 
results of operations overview our analysis and evaluation of our consolidated results of operations focuses on the operating performance of our crude oil and product carrier clean fleets 
our vessels are deployed under medium to long term time charters  contracts of affreightment coas or spot market charters some with pool arrangements 
revenues vary with each type of charter and prevailing shipping rates 
expenses also vary with each type of charter and further depend on the cost of fuel  the ports and canals used and the shipping route 
a time charter involves the placing of a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily or monthly hire rate 
under a voyage charter in the spot market  the owner of a vessel agrees to provide the vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for the owner s account 
we also have several coas  which are agreements providing for the transportation of a specific quantity of cargo over a specific time period but without designating specific vessels or voyage schedules  thereby allowing flexibility in scheduling 
coas can either have a fixed rate or a market related rate 
voyage  time charters and coas are available for varying periods  ranging from a single trip to a long term arrangement 
in general  a long term charter assures the vessel owner of a consistent stream of revenue 
our use of time charters also reduces in part the seasonality of the spot market business 
generally  spot markets are strongest in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year  and weaker in the second and third quarters 
operating the vessel in the spot market affords the owner greater speculative opportunity  which may result in high rates when ships are in high demand or low rates possibly insufficient to cover costs when ship availability exceeds demand 
ship charter rates are affected by world economics  international events  weather conditions  strikes  governmental policies  supply and demand  and many other factors beyond our control 
consistent with industry practice  we use time charter equivalent  or tce revenue  which comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters tc and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market spot 
tce revenue serves as a measure for analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
tce revenue also serves as an industry standard for measuring revenue and comparing results among competitors 
because the tanker industry distinguishes vessels in the market primarily on the size and design configuration of the vessels  the type of cargo vessels are equipped to transport and the arrangements under which the vessels are chartered  we present various other measures of our financial performance  including separate analysis of tce revenue for voyage spot charters and time charters  vessel operating income  which is equal to tce revenue less vessel expenses  charter hire expense and depreciation and amortization  by our reportable segments  the crude oil fleet and clean fleet  the number of operating or tce revenue days  which is the number of days our vessels were available for employment by our crude oil fleet and clean fleet  and average daily tce revenue and average daily vessel expense by our crude oil fleet and clean fleet 
vessel expenses include operating expenses such as crew related costs  stores  routine maintenance and repairs  insurance and miscellaneous 
these expenses are a function of the fleet size  utilization levels for certain expenses  requirements under laws and by charterer  and our standards 
charter hire expense is the payment made to the owner of a vessel time chartered or bareboat chartered for our use 
under a time charter  the owner is responsible for the vessel s operating expenses  in addition to drydock and capital expenditures 
under a bareboat charter  the charterer is responsible for the vessel s operating expenses  in addition to the cost of the drydock 
in a time charter or bareboat  we are responsible for the voyage expenses if the vessel operates in the spot market 
charter hire expense also includes the pool charter hire for the non omi vessels included in the gemini pool 
insurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured s loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
during  we had modest increases in our protection and indemnity p i rates  ie liability insurance while our hull and machinery ie asset insurance costs have stayed relatively flat  except for increases due to increased values of our suezmax vessels 
p i rates for coverage in were higher as a result of losses from prior years by the p i clubs and will also be higher in due to general increases and the loss record of the company 
war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are often for the account of the charterers 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  time charter equivalent revenue the company earned tce revenue of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the following table summarizes our consolidated tce results for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  net change in millions time charter equivalent revenue voyage and time charter revenue voyage expenses time charter equivalent revenue the following table summarizes tce revenue by our two reporting segments  the crude oil fleet and the product carrier or clean fleet for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  net change in millions time charter equivalent revenue crude oil fleet clean fleet total in addition to analyzing tce revenue by reportable segment  we also analyze fluctuations by fleet and type of charter spot or time 
in both and  the majority of our tonnage primarily our suezmax vessels operated in the spot market  giving us the ability to benefit from the strong spot market 
as of december   of our vessels dwt  or vessels  operated in the spot market and of our dwt  or of our vessels  operated under time charters 
eleven of the vessels on time charter were under profit sharing arrangements see contracted time charter revenue section 
assuming no new charters or charter extensions by the end of  we will have approximately of our dwt  or vessels  operating in the spot market  and of our dwt will be operating under time charters out of vessels time charters have profit sharing  without considering renewals for three time charters expiring during the year  two of which have profit sharing 
our time charters with profit sharing arrangements have floor rates 
if earnings exceed the floor rate  we share in the profit above that rate equally 
this enables us to benefit from strong tanker markets while protecting our downside 
revenue generated by time charters gives the company the ability to cover certain fixed charges vessel expenses for vessels on time charter  consolidated general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
during the year ended december   or million of our tce revenue was earned by vessels operating in the spot market and  or million of our tce revenue was earned by vessels operating on tc 
tce revenue increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table summarizes tce revenue by our two reporting segments  the crude oil fleet and the clean fleet by tce revenue generated by vessels operating on spot charters for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  net change in millions tce revenue for vessels on spot crude oil fleet clean fleet total increase in spot revenue in tce revenue of million earned by vessels operating in the spot market during increased million compared to tce revenue of million earned by vessels operating in the spot market during the increase in tce revenue resulted from an additional million earned by the clean fleet offset by a decrease of million earned by the crude oil fleet 
increases in tce revenue of million earned by the vessels in the clean fleet operating on spot charters was primarily the result of  more operating days in  of which was from seven vessels acquired in and  the balance was primarily due to vessels with expiring time charters that began operating in the spot market

the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas r  however  in adopting this standard  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
on april  the us securities and exchange commission the sec announced a deferral of the effective date of sfas r for calendar year companies until the beginning of and this pronouncement will apply to all awards existing as of the adoption date  as well as those granted and modified after the adoption date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which could impact its results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that reflects management s interest rate outlook at various times by entering into interest rate swap agreements  in which it agrees to pay a fixed interest rate and receive market interest rate based on contracted notional amounts and for specific period of time 
the interest rate swaps are entered into with financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
the company uses such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   the floating rate debt  taking into account the interest rate swaps referred to herein  was million of the million total debt  and we had interest rate swaps relating to the floating rate debt of million including million on interest rate swaps that commences in 
at december   the floating rate debt was million  and we had interest rate swaps relating to the floating rate debt of million including million on interest rate swaps that commences in 
based on the floating rate debt at december   a one percentage point increase in the floating interest rate would increase interest expense by million per year 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt on our balance sheet was million as of december   and million as of december the table below provides information about interest rates  including our debt obligations and interest rate swaps at december  for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
expected maturities balance as of dec 
 thereafter in millions  except percentages long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt interest rate swaps contract amount average fixed pay rate these are the expected maturities based on the balances as of december  the interest rates for the variable rate debt is based on libor contracts  which range from days to one year 
in  million of fixed rate debt reverts to variable rate debt 
excludes million for two swaps beginning in spot market rate risk we use written forward freight agreements ffas as a hedge to protect against the change in spot market rates earned by some of our vessels 
ffas involve contracts to provide theoretical voyages at fixed rates thus hedging a portion of the company s exposure to the spot charter market 
the fair value of ffas is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
at december   the ffas had an aggregate notional value of million  which is an aggregate of both long and short positions that extend to march the fair value of million at december  of our forward freight agreements is the estimated net amount that the company would receive to terminate the agreements at the reporting date
