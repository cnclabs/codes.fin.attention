item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general millennium bankshares corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in reston  virginia 
we were incorporated in and began operations in april we provide services through our principal operating subsidiary  millennium bank 
we presently operate seven banking offices  all in virginia 
two offices are in reston  one each is in great falls  herndon  and warrenton  and two are in the richmond  virginia area 
we also have a loan production office located in fredericksburg  virginia 
we are a community bank providing a broad range of commercial and retail banking services designed to meet the needs of businesses and consumers in the communities we serve 
we emphasize local decision making within our organization and provide personal service to our customers 
by combining the technological support  products and services that our customers demand with direct access to senior management and responsive customer service  we work to foster a business and consumer banking environment that allows us to effectively compete in our particular market with other financial institutions of all sizes 
our operating revenues are derived primarily from interest earned on loans and investment securities portfolio net of interest paid on deposit products and borrowings 
millennium also receives revenue from sales of mortgage and small business administration loans and fee income from loans  deposits and other banking products 
millennium continues to seek and evaluate additional expansion alternatives either through loan production offices or new branch locations 
the new branch locations can be a prior branch location purchased from an existing institution or a de novo site determined to best suit our strategic plans 
in addition  we intend to consider various strategic acquisitions of banks  banking assets or financial service entities related to banking in our geographical areas that management believes would complement and increase our existing business lines  or expansion into new market areas or product lines that management determines would be in the best interest of millennium and its shareholders 
the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of our operations for the years ended december   and the discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
see also note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this form k 
allowance for loan losses millennium monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
millennium maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control 
table of contents over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
millennium evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  millennium makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of millennium as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
millennium recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
financial summary for the year ended december   millennium reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share for the same period in the annualized return on average assets and return on equity for the period ended december   are and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  for the comparable period in in addition to dealing with a challenging economic environment and flat yield curve in  a significant focus in was centered on the acquisition of albemarle first bank  charlottesville  virginia 
this acquisition  however  was terminated on november  due to our failure to receive requisite shareholder approval 
net income for the year ended was negatively impacted by after tax charges of thousand related to writing off transaction costs associated with the terminated acquisition 
in  millennium also incurred after tax securities losses of thousand in a transaction designed to improve the investment portfolio risk profile 
total assets increased to million at december   compared to million at december   representing an increase of million or 
loans including loans held for sale  net of allowance for loan losses at december  were million  a decrease of million from the december  
table of contents balance of million 
loans held for sale decreased million while the bank s portfolio increased by million 
the investment portfolio increased by million at december  as compared to the prior year ended december  the increase was reflected primarily in two sectors states and political subdivisions and mortgage backed securities  as millennium sought to improve portfolio diversification and the overall risk profile 
total deposits reached million at december   an million increase over the prior year end 
due to the introduction of a special now account for senior citizens  there was a shift in product mix from savings and money market to now with the bulk of the increase in total deposits reflected in time deposits 
shareholders equity was million at december  compared with million at december  shareholders equity increased only slightly in as the increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss offset the growth in earnings 
other comprehensive income is the change in the market value of the investment portfolio due to changes in interest rates  net of taxes 
book value per share was at december  and at december  net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our earnings and is equal to the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense 
interest earning assets consist primarily of loans and securities  while deposits and borrowings represent the major portion of interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the yields and rates paid  determine changes in net interest income 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
our net interest margin is sensitive to the volume of mortgage loan originations 
loans originated by our mortgage subsidiary are sold  servicing released  in the secondary mortgage market 
when the volume of mortgage loan originations increases  funds advanced in settlement of mortgage loans increase  pending delivery of the loans to the loan purchaser 
until a mortgage loan is transferred to the purchaser  we receive interest on the loan at the note rate 
while such funds advanced contribute to net interest income  the interest rate spread on mortgage loans held for sale is not as great as the spread on our loan portfolio  which normally carries a higher interest yield 
thus  as funds advanced in settlement of mortgage loans increase  the interest spread and the net interest margin decrease 
as reflected in the following table  net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in interest income for the year ended december  was million  up from million for the same period last year 
the interest income increase was attributable to a increase in average earning assets coupled with a basis point increase in gross yield 
loan yield increased basis points as existing variable rate loans tied to prime repriced upward concurrent with the continuing tightening of short term rates by the federal open market committee  which tends to cause increases in the prime rate  and as new volume was originated in a rising rate environment 
average loans increased while average securities increased 
interest expense increased million as the average balance of deposits and borrowed funds increased as well as the rates paid thereon 
since much of the increased funding for lending activities was concentrated in higher rate products  the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased in greater magnitude than earning asset yield 
since deposit growth did not keep pace with earning asset growth there was a heavier reliance on wholesale funding  such as advances from the federal home loan bank 
funding of earning assets from interest free sources also declined from for the year ended december  to for the same period this year 
with market rates continuing to rise  millennium is focusing its deposit initiatives on generating higher volumes of lower cost demand and transaction accounts 
these initiatives include the implementation of automated wire notification  increased promotion of the electronic check deposit product and the establishment of a corporate wide incentive program designed specifically to focus employees on these products 
the establishment of an asset based lending division is also expected to compliment the demand deposit growth initiative 
the net interest margin decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in

table of contents the following table shows the contractual maturity of selected categories of loans at december  the table reflects the entire unpaid principal balance in the maturity period that includes the final loan payment date  and accordingly  does not give effect to periodic principal repayments or possible prepayments 
december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction within year variable rate to years after years total fixed rate to years after years total total maturities asset quality general asset quality is an important factor in the successful operation of a financial institution 
banking regulations require institutions to classify their assets and to establish prudent general allowances for losses for assets classified as substandard or doubtful 
for the portion of assets classified as loss  an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of of the amount classified or charge such amounts off its books 
assets which do not currently expose millennium to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess potential weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention by management 
these loans are monitored closely so that we can mitigate our exposure to further deterioration in the asset 
millennium charges off any loans that are classified as loss 
unless well secured and in the process of collection  millennium places loans in a non accrual status once they become past due greater than days  or earlier in situations in which the loans have developed inherent problems that indicate payment of principal and interest may not be made in full 
whenever the accrual of interest is stopped  previously accrued but uncollected interest income is reversed 
thereafter  interest is recognized only as cash is received 
the loan is reinstated to an accrual basis after it has been brought current as to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan 

table of contents non performing assets millennium had  of non accrual loans at december   compared to  at december  the following table details information concerning non accrual  past due and restructured loans at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans foreclosed properties restructured loans total non performing assets loans past due days or more and still accruing interest information regarding impaired loans is as follows december  loans with no allocated allowance for loan losses loans with allocated allowance for loan losses total amount of the allowance for loan losses allocated average investment in impaired loans interest income recognized during impairment interest income recognized on a cash basis on impaired loans no additional funds are committed to be advanced in connection with the above impaired loans 
delinquent and problem loans when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  millennium attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower 
a notice is mailed to the borrower after a payment is days past due and again when the loan is days past due 
for most loans  if the delinquency is not cured within days  millennium issues a notice of intent to foreclose on the property and if the delinquency is not cured within days  millennium may institute foreclosure action 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
allowance for losses on loans millennium provides valuation allowances for probable losses incurred on loans when we determine that a significant decline in the value of the collateral has occurred  and if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of the unpaid principal of the related loan plus estimated costs of acquisition and sale 
in addition  millennium also provides reserves based on the dollar amount and type of collateral securing its loans  in order to protect against unanticipated losses 
a loss experience percentage is established for each loan type and is reviewed at least annually  and more frequently if we identify factors that require us to consider a change to the percentage 
each month  the loss percentage is applied to the portfolio  by product type  to determine the minimum amount of reserves required 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to reserves may be necessary  and net income could be significantly affected  if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions used in making the initial determinations 

table of contents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses  including charge off activity  is presented below for the periods indicated 
although net charge offs were lower in than in  the provision for loan loss expense was higher than in due primarily to revised qualitative factors utilized in the allowance methodology 
year ended december in thousands balance  beginning of period less charge offs commercial real estate mortgage consumer installment loans plus recoveries commercial real estate mortgage consumer installment loans net charge offs provision for loan losses balance  end of period ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the period the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  compared to million at december  the provision for loan losses for was  as compared to  for the period ended december  the allowance for loan losses was of total loans outstanding at december  compared to at december  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were and for december  and  respectively 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover credit losses probable and incurred in the loan portfolio at december  
table of contents a breakdown of the allowance for loan losses in dollars and loans in each category to total loans in percentages is provided in the following tables 
because all of these factors are subject to change  the breakdown does not necessarily predict future loan losses in the indicated categories

the following table presents information on the sources and amounts of non interest income 
december noninterest income dollars in thousands service charges gain on sale of loans and loan fees  net gain loss on sale of securities  net other income total most of noninterest income consists of gains on sales of loans which is discussed further in the table and text which follows 

table of contents the loss on sale of securities recognized in was incurred in conjunction with an investment portfolio repositioning designed to improve the investment portfolio risk profile 
the tables that follow summarize residential mortgage loan originations  purchases and sales by type of loan for the periods indicated 
december  dollars in thousands amount of total amount of total mortgage loans originated and purchased fixed rate first mortgage second mortgage adjustable rate first mortgage second mortgage total residential mortgage loans originated and purchased mortgage loans sold fixed rate first mortgage second mortgage adjustable rate first mortgage second mortgage total mortgage loans sold we made mortgage loans through millennium capital through august  and our majority owned operating subsidiaries 
the majority of our residential mortgage loan production came from our non banking operating subsidiaries and millennium capital 
each operating subsidiary s loan production consists primarily of loans to consumers acquired from direct relationships and brokers 
we sell residential first and second mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market to institutional purchasers 
all second mortgage loans and all fixed rate first mortgage loans originated or purchased are held for sale 
millennium began originating federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans in march we do not swap mortgage loans for mortgage backed securities 
all loan sales are for cash 
when we sell loans we give customary representations and warranties 
if we breach those representations and warranties  a buyer of loans can require us to repurchase the loans 
mortgage banking activities generally involve risks of loss if secondary mortgage market interest rates increase substantially while a loan is in the pipeline the period beginning with the application to make or the commitment to purchase a loan and ending with the sale of the loan 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we sell each fixed rate first mortgage loan when the borrower locks in the interest rate on the loan 
millennium does not use options  futures or other derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
in an environment of stable interest rates  our gains on the sale of mortgage loans would generally be limited to those gains resulting from the yield differential between retail mortgage loan interest rates and rates required by secondary market purchasers 
a loss from the sale of a loan may occur if interest rates increase between the time we establish the interest rate on a loan and the time the loan is sold 

table of contents periods of rising interest rates generally will adversely affect our income from our mortgage banking operations 
in periods of rising interest rates  consumer demand for new mortgages and refinancing decreases  which in turn adversely affects our mortgage lending 
in  origination volume remained strong despite rising rates because the overall level of market rates still remained low compared to historical levels 
because of the uncertainty of future loan origination volume and the future level of interest rates  there can be no assurance that we will realize gains on the sale of loans in future periods 
noninterest expense december  noninterest expense dollars in thousands salary and benefits occupancy furniture  equipment computers litigation expenses marketing fees professional fees merger related expense administrative expense total includes litigation related legal fees and related expenses 
excludes litigation related legal fees and expenses 
salaries and benefits expense  the largest component of noninterest expense  has steadily increased in correlation with the expansion of mortgage lending and support staff for that function as well as increased commissions on the higher volume of mortgage loans 
the occupancy expense increase for compared to was primarily due to increased costs associated with the warrenton branch  which opened in august  and the cost of additional space to house staff at the mortgage segment 
the merger related expenses recognized in were transaction costs associated with the terminated acquisition of albemarle first bank 
income taxes millennium recorded income tax expense in the amount of for the year ended december  the income tax expense for was  as of december  we had used all of our net operating losses available 
in addition to federal income taxes the bank pays a virginia state franchise tax 
the franchise tax was   and  for the years ending december    and  respectively 
sources of funds deposits deposits have been the principal source of millennium s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes 
at present  millennium has employed alternative methods to gather deposits to fund our mortgage loan operations and commercial lending 
alternative methods used are advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta for daily and longer term borrowings and also brokered deposits 
brokered deposits are deposits that we obtain through brokers for a fee 
brokered deposits are available in bulk  and they do not require any investments in branch offices  branch personnel or additional spending for marketing or education of employees 
the brokered deposits that we obtain consist primarily of jumbo day to years certificates of deposits 
brokered deposits often earn a rate of interest that is higher than the rates we pay on other deposit products  which increases millennium s overall cost of funds and decreases our net interest margin 
in addition to deposits  millennium derives funds from loan repayments  cash flows generated from operations  which includes interest credited to deposit accounts  repurchase agreements entered into with commercial banks and federal home loan bank of atlanta advances 
borrowings may be used to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and have been used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities 

table of contents millennium attracts both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide assortment of accounts and rates 
millennium offers statement savings accounts  various checking accounts  various money market accounts  fixed rate certificates with varying maturities  and individual retirement accounts and is expanding to provide deposit products and services for businesses 
millennium s principal use of deposits is to originate loans and fund investment securities 
at december   deposits were million  an increase of from million at december  the deposit growth is a reflection of branch office growth  aggressive pricing  marketing and other bank consolidation in millennium s principal market 
in order to reduce the overall cost of funds and reduce our reliance on high cost time deposits and short term borrowings as a funding source  we continue to direct extensive marketing efforts towards attracting lower cost transaction accounts 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful  or if successful  that they will reduce our reliance on time deposits and short term borrowings

the ability of millennium to attract and maintain deposits  and its cost of funds  has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by money market conditions

each federal home loan bank credit program has its own interest rate  which may be fixed or variable  and range of maturities 
the federal home loan bank may prescribe the acceptable uses to which these advances may be put  as well as on the size of the advances and repayment provisions 
the advances are collateralized by millennium s investment in federal home loan bank stock and by millennium s investment securities 
at december   and december   million and million  respectively  was outstanding to the federal home loan bank 
millennium s borrowings also include securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized with government agency securities 
the proceeds are used by millennium for general corporate purposes 
at december   and december   millennium had and  respectively  of securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
at december  and december   respectively  millennium had thousand and million  respectively  in federal funds purchased 
millennium uses borrowings to supplement deposits when borrowings are available at a lower overall cost to millennium or they can be invested at a positive rate of return

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through asset and liability management 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is provided 
as a result of millennium s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through increasing deposits  management believes that millennium maintains overall liquidity that is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
millennium s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  and amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and investments  and loan sales 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
excess funds are invested in overnight deposits to fund cash requirements experienced in the normal course of business 
millennium has been able to generate sufficient cash through its deposits as well as borrowings 
for the year ended december  operating activities provided approximately million in cash as compared to the use of approximately million in cash in this change resulted primarily from the net decrease in loans held for sale of million in as compared to the net increase in loans held for sale of million in investing activities absorbed approximately million and million respectively for the years ended december  and in  the change resulted primarily from a net increase in investment securities of million and the purchase of million in bank owned life insurance 
in  investing activities were primarily a result of a net increase in loans of million and net increase in investment securities of million 
in addition  for the years ended december  and  financing activities provided and million  respectively 
in  this change was mainly attributable to an increase in deposits of million and a million increase in fhlb borrowings 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in federal funds purchased 
for the year ended  financing activities were a result of the proceeds from issuance of common stock netting million 
in addition net increases in deposits of million and net increases in fhlb borrowings of million occurred 
millennium uses its sources of funds primarily to meet operating needs  to pay deposit withdrawals and fund loan commitments 
at december  and december  total approved loan commitments were million and million  respectively 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
at december   we had a borrowing limit of million with the federal home loan bank 
our outstanding borrowings from the federal home loan bank totaled million at december   which leaves an additional borrowing capacity of million 
our borrowing limit is based on of bank assets at each quarter end date 
we also have two lines of credit with the community bankers bank in virginia in the amounts of million secured and million unsecured 
our outstanding borrowings from the community bankers bank totaled million at december   with remaining available lines of credit of million 
in addition  we have a million line of credit with the bankers bank 
there were no borrowings outstanding against this line at december  management intends to fund anticipated loan closings and operating needs through cash on hand  brokered deposits  proceeds from the sale of loans  cash generated from operations and anticipated increases in deposits 
current and anticipated marketing programs will be primarily targeted at the attraction of lower cost transaction accounts 
capital represents funds  earned or obtained  over which financial institutions can exercise greater control in comparison with deposits and borrowed funds 
the adequacy of millennium s capital is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis with reference to size  composition and quality of millennium s resources and consistent with regulatory requirements and industry standards 
management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will support anticipated asset growth and absorb any potential losses 

table of contents millennium bankshares and millennium bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements of the federal reserve

off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements 
maturity by period december  in thousands less than year greater than year to years greater than years to years greater than years total standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit mortgage banking commitments rate lock commitments standby letters of credit represent commitments by us to repay a third party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay a loan or debt instrument 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
in addition to credit risk  we also have liquidity risk associated with stand by letters of credit because funding for these obligations could be required immediately 

table of contents commitments to extend credit are loan commitments  which assure a borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate on a loan millennium intends to hold in its portfolio 
the risk to millennium under such commitments is limited to the terms of the contracts 
for example  millennium may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
this is also a liquidity risk since the customer may demand immediate cash that would require funding and interest rate risk as market interest rates may rise above the rate committed 
our mortgage banking activities generally include two types of commitments by millennium 
the first type is a rate lock commitment with the client 
in a rate lock commitment  a client while in process of obtaining approval for a fixed rate secondary market loan can  at their own determination  fix or lock in the rate on the loan 
the commitments are generally for periods of to days and are at market rates 
to mitigate risk from market interest rate fluctuations and to provide for a mechanism to deliver these loans into the secondary market  we generally enter into mandatory forward sales contracts on rate lock commitments 
second  we also have mandatory sales contracts covering loans held for sale  which represents a price commitment 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations 
maturity by period as of december  dollars in thousands less than year greater than year to years greater than years to years greater than years total deposits fhlb borrowings subordinated debentures lease commitments total deposits represent non interest bearing  money market  savings  now  certificates of deposits  brokered and all other deposits held by the company 
amounts that have an indeterminate maturity period are included in the less than one year category above 
fhlb borrowings represent the amounts that are due to the fhlb of atlanta 
these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
some of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb or millennium can prepay these advances without a penalty 
management does not believe these advances will be converted in the near term 
lease commitments represent the total minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices and seasonality the financial statements that are included in this document have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
caution about forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this form k that are subject to risks and uncertainties

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
millennium s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of millennium s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegated the responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 

table of contents millennium uses two primary methods to evaluate market risk to changes in interest rates static gap analysis and simulation analysis 
static gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval measured at a balance sheet date 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments  by replacing an asset or liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
as reflected in the table below  millennium  at december   had million more in liabilities than assets that can reprice within one year or less and therefore we were in a liability sensitive position 
generally  a liability sensitive position is favorable to the bank in a decreasing rate environment and unfavorable to the bank in an increasing rate environment 
it is important to recognize that deposits with no stated maturity have been presented in this gap table in the months or less bucket because they can reprice in that time frame 
these deposits may not indeed reprice that quickly  however 
the following table presents the amounts of millennium s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in the periods indicated exclusive of non accrual loans

excludes federal reserve  federal home loan bank  and community bankers bank stock 
anticipates prepayments on fnma and fhlmc pools 
contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of millennium s loan portfolio 
the average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and enforcement of due on sale clauses  which gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
in addition  certain borrowers increase their equity in the security property by making payments in excess of those required under the terms of the mortgage 

table of contents due to the inherent limitations of gap analysis  millennium utilizes simulation analysis as its primary tool for managing interest rate risk 
simulation analysis calculates expected net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios and the theoretical impact of immediate and sustained rate changes referred to as rate shocks 
this methodology is more sophisticated than the traditional gap analysis and more accurately reflects the impact on net interest income from embedded options in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
millennium places a higher degree of reliance on simulation modeling in its alco decision making process 
the simulation model is prepared and updated on a regular basis 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure of no more than the following reflects the results of millennium s net interest income sensitivity analysis at december  rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity bp bp at december   millennium s interest rate risk model indicated that  in a rising rate environment of basis points  net interest income could increase by 
in the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points  net interest income would decrease 
millennium s net interest income at risk is out of policy limits in the down basis point shock 
management has been actively engaging in strategies to minimize the identified risk in the declining rate environment and anticipates the magnitude of sensitivity in the declining rate environment will continue to diminish in management also does not view the likelihood of a basis point decline in the near term as very probable but is nonetheless currently contemplating additional actions which can be taken to further minimize the identified risk in the declining rate environment 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels such as yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  millennium cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to  or in anticipation of  changes in interest rates 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
millennium also performs economic value of equity modeling as a measurement tool 
the market value of equity measures the degree to which the market value of millennium s assets and liabilities will change given a change in interest rates
