item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since our inception  we have devoted the vast majority of our resources to the research and development of onconase r and related drug candidates 
we have focused our resources towards the completion of the clinical program for unresectable  or inoperable  malignant mesothelioma 
since onconase r has fast track designation from the food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma patients  we continue to have meetings and discussions with the fda to establish mutually agreed upon parameters for the new drug application  or nda  to obtain marketing approval for onconase r  assuming the phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma yields favorable results 
we received an orphan medicinal product designation for onconase r from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea 
we continue to fulfill the emea requirements regarding the marketing authorization application  or maa  registration requirements for onconase r for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma 
we received an orphan drug designation for onconase r for malignant mesothelioma in australia from the therapeutics goods administration  or tga 
this designation in australia entitles us to five years of marketing exclusivity  a waiver of filing fees and regulatory guidance from the tga 
almost all of the  of research and development expenses we have incurred since our inception has gone toward the development of onconase r and related drug candidates 
for the fiscal years  and our research and development expenses were   and  respectively  almost all of which were used for the development of onconase r and related drug candidates 
onconase r is currently in an international  centrally randomized  confirmatory phase iiib registration trial 
the first part of the trial has been completed 
the second confirmatory part of the trial is ongoing 
the primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival 
the first interim analysis results based on one third of the required events deaths of the study  which evaluates the efficacy  safety and tolerability of the combination of onconase doxorubicin as compared to doxorubicin alone have been reported 
the overall median survival time mst demonstrated a trend favoring the onconase doxorubicin treatment group months over the doxorubicin group months 
a two month improvement in median survival had previously been observed in the treatment target group n analysis from the completed phase iii single agent study that favored the onconase over doxorubicin treatments months vs 
months 
the company s phase iiib confirmatory registration trial was designed based on the conclusions drawn from the ttg analysis but powered to reach a statistically significant difference in mst between the onconase doxorubicin treatment group and the doxorubicin treatment group at events 
the interim data which represented only one third of the planned number of events was sufficient for us to continue the trial as planned  but was not sufficient for supporting the filing for marketing approvals at that time 
at this time  we cannot predict with certainty when a sufficient number of deaths will occur to achieve statistical significance 
the timing of when we will be able to file for marketing registrations in the us  eu and australia is data driven 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty what our total cost associated with obtaining marketing approvals will be  or when and if such approvals will be granted  or when actual sales will occur 
we have completed the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section of the nda and will submit it after completion of a review by external regulatory consultants 
we fund the research and development of our products primarily from cash receipts resulting from the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our tax benefits and research products  interest income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
during the fiscal year ended july   we received net proceeds of approximately million as a result of private placements of common stock and warrants and from exercises of stock options and warrants 
these proceeds will be used to support our strategic plan  including the anticipated filing of an nda of onconase r for malignant mesothelioma  assuming satisfactory results from the ongoing clinical trial  the expansion of the onconase oncology franchise  and the development of other pipeline products 
we have incurred losses since inception and to date we have not consummated any licensing  or marketing agreements for onconase r or any of our early drug candidates 
results of operations fiscal years ended july   and revenues we are a development stage company as defined in the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
we are devoting substantially all our present efforts to establishing a new business and developing new drug products 
our planned principal operations of marketing and or licensing of new drugs have not commenced and  accordingly  we have not derived any significant revenue from these operations 
we focus most of our productive and financial resources on the development of onconase r

this amount  which is a carryover of our remaining tax benefits from state fiscal year and earlier  may increase if we incur additional tax losses during state fiscal year we cannot estimate  however  what percentage of our saleable tax benefits new jersey will permit us to sell  how much money we will receive in connection with the sale  if we will be able to find a buyer for our tax benefits or if such funds will be available in a timely manner 
net loss we have incurred net losses during each year since our inception 
the net loss for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the cumulative loss from the date of inception  august   to july  amounted to  such losses are attributable to the fact that we are still in the development stage and  accordingly  have not derived sufficient revenues from operations to offset the development stage expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we have reported net losses of approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
the net losses from date of inception  august   to july   amounts to  we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of our equity securities and convertible debentures in registered offerings and private placements 
additionally  we have raised capital through other debt financings  the sale of our tax benefits and research products  and interest income and financing received from our chief executive officer 
during the fiscal year  we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of  which resulted from net cash provided by financing activities of  primarily from private placement of common stock and warrants of  and from exercises of stock options and warrants of  offset by net cash used in operating activities of  principally for research and development activities  and net cash used in investing activities due to the purchase of property and equipment of  total cash resources as of july  were  compared to  at july  our current liabilities as of july  were  compared to  at july   an increase of  the increase was primarily due an increase in accounts payable of approximately  mainly due to the manufacturing of onconase r of approximately  pre clinical studies and clinical trial of approximately  and  respectively  and legal fees of approximately  and a decrease in accruals of approximately the following transactions occurred after july  o in august  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options by an officer and an employee at an exercise price of per share 
we realized gross proceeds of  from these exercises 
until and unless our operations generate significant revenues  we expect to continue to fund operations from equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need on terms which are acceptable  if at all 
during the fiscal year ended july   we received net proceeds of approximately million as a result of private placements of common stock and warrants and from exercises of stock options and warrants 
we expect that such net proceeds together with our cash reserves  will be sufficient to fund our operations through july  based on our expected level of expenditures 
these proceeds will be used to support our strategic plan  including the anticipated filing of an nda of onconase r for malignant mesothelioma  assuming satisfactory results from the ongoing clinical trial  the expansion of the onconase oncology franchise  and the development of other pipeline products 
we may also obtain additional capital through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and the sale of our tax benefits  although we cannot provide any assurance of such exercises or the amount of capital we will receive  if any 
we will continue to incur costs in conjunction with our us and foreign registrations for marketing approval of onconase r 
we are currently in discussions with potential strategic alliance partners to further the development and marketing of onconase r and other related products in our pipeline 
however  we cannot be sure that any such alliances will materialize 
the market price of our common stock is volatile  and the price of the stock could be dramatically affected one way or another depending on numerous factors 
the market price of our common stock could also be materially affected by the marketing approval or lack of marketing approval of onconase r 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or spe  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the accounting policies set forth below have been considered critical because changes to certain judgments  estimates and assumptions could significantly affect our financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures during the reporting period 
since some of those estimates are subjective and complex  actual results could differ from those estimates 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  which amends sfas and was effective beginning with our fiscal year ended july  the new standard requires all share based payments  including stock option grants to employees  to be recognized as an operating expense in the statement of operations
