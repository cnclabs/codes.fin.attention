item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included herein 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from these indicated forward looking statements 
for information about these assumptions and other risks and exposures relating to our business and our company  you should refer to the section entitled forward looking statements and risk factors 
recapitalization on june   we closed a new million senior secured credit facility see note  repaid million of debt under our previously outstanding senior credit agreement and percent senior subordinated notes due  converted all outstanding shares of preferred stock into  shares of common stock  and completed a million offering of  primary shares and  secondary shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
the new credit facility allows us to pay dividends and is expected to result in cash interest savings of over million annualized when compared to the interest costs of our previously outstanding senior and subordinated debt 
the new credit facility  debt repayment  preferred stock conversion  and primary and secondary common stock offering are collectively referred to herein as the recapitalization 
we incurred certain costs and write offs relating to the recapitalization  including million of transaction costs and expenses  million for stock option redemptions  million for transaction bonuses and million of debt extinguishment costs including a tender premium of million  write off of debt issuance costs of million  and other costs totaling million 
the million charge for stock options redeemed relates to  options that were redeemed for million of cash 
we also recognized as dividends million of previously unrecognized accretion on our preferred stock 
these costs  write offs and accretion have been included in our statements of operations for the year ended december  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy  effective upon the closing of the recapitalization 
we paid quarterly dividends of per share  or million in august and million in november we declared a dividend in february we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of approximately per share  but only if and to the extent dividends are declared by our board of directors and permitted by applicable law and by the terms of our new senior secured credit facility see note 
dividend payments are not guaranteed and our board of directors may decide  in its absolute discretion  not to pay dividends 
dividends on our common stock are not cumulative 
we received total net proceeds from the sale of primary shares in the offering of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds from this offering  together with million of borrowings under the new credit facility and other borrowings after the closing of the recapitalization as follows million to repay in full indebtedness under the previously existing credit facility including accrued interest of million  million to pay fees and expenses associated with the establishment of the new credit facility and the repayment of the existing credit facility and other related fees and expenses  million to repurchase all of our outstanding percent notes including tender premium of million and accrued interest of million  million associated with the redemption of a portion of outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock held by certain members of our senior management and board of directors  and million to pay transaction bonuses to certain members of our senior management 

table of contents background we generate substantially all of our revenue by providing water and wastewater residuals management services to municipal and industrial customers 
we provide our customers with services and capabilities  including  drying and pelletization  composting  product marketing  incineration  alkaline stabilization  land application  collection and transportation  regulatory compliance  dewatering  and facility cleanout services 
we currently serve more than customers in states and the district of columbia 
our contracts typically have inflation price adjustments  renewal clauses and broad force majeure provisions 
for the year ended december   we experienced a contract retention rate both renewals and rebids of approximately percent 
we categorize our revenues into five types contract  purchase order  product sales  design build construction and event work 
contract revenues are generated primarily from land application  collection and transportation services  dewatering  incineration  composting  drying and pelletization services and facility operations and maintenance  and are typically performed under a contract with terms ranging from to years 
purchase order revenues are primarily from facility operations  maintenance services  and collection and transportation services where services are performed on a recurring basis  but not under a long term contract 
product sales revenues are primarily generated from sales of composted and pelletized biosolids from internal and external facilities 
design build construction revenues are derived from construction projects where we agree to design and build a biosolids facility such as a drying and pelletization facility  composting facility  incineration facility or a dewatering facility that we will subsequently operate once the facility commences commercial operations 
event project revenues are typically generated from digester or lagoon cleanout projects and temporary dewatering projects 
the company s percentage of revenue by type is summarized below for the years ended december  contract purchase order product sales design build construction event revenues under our facilities operations and maintenance contracts are recognized either when wastewater residuals enter the facility or when the residuals have been processed  depending on the contract terms 
all other revenues under service contracts are recognized when the service is performed 
revenues from design build construction projects and multi year cleanout projects are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we provide for losses in connection with long term contracts where an obligation exists to perform services and it becomes evident that the projected contract costs will exceed the related revenue 
our costs relating to service contracts include processing  transportation  spreading and disposal costs  and depreciation of operating assets 
our spreading  transportation and disposal costs can be adversely affected by unusual weather conditions and unseasonably heavy rainfall  which can temporarily reduce the availability of land application 
material must be transported to either a permitted storage facility if available or to a local landfill for disposal 
in either case  this results in additional costs for transporting  storage and disposal of the biosolid materials versus land application in a period of normal weather conditions 
processing and transportation costs can also be adversely impacted by higher fuel costs 
in order to manage this risk at processing facilities  we generally enter into contracts that pass through fuel cost increases to the customer  or for contracts without pass through provisions  we from time to time lock in our fuel costs with our fuel suppliers for terms ranging from to months 
we have locked in percent of our natural gas unit costs for that we do not have a contractual pass through 
we have also locked in percent of our electricity costs on contracts that do not have contractual pass through agreements through december we continuously review various hedging strategies and plant efficiency opportunities to 
table of contents mitigate this risk going forward  but do expect natural gas costs will remain high through we subcontract a significant portion of our transportation requirements to numerous contractors which enables us to minimize the impact of changes in fuel costs for over the road equipment 
we have also periodically implemented temporary fuel surcharges with selected customers 
our costs relating to construction contracts primarily include subcontractor costs related to design  permit and general construction 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of accounting  information systems  marketing  legal  human resources  regulatory compliance  and regional and executive management costs 
our management reviews and analyzes several trends and key performance indicators in order to manage our business 
since approximately percent of our revenues are generated from municipal water and wastewater plants  we monitor trends involving municipal generators  including  among other things  aging infrastructure  technology advances  and regulatory activity in the water and wastewater residuals management industry 
we use this information to anticipate upcoming growth opportunities  including new facility growth opportunities similar to the sacramento  california and pinellas county  florida dryer projects that we started over the past three years 
we also use this information to manage potential business risks such as increased regulatory pressure or local public opposition to residuals management programs 
on an ongoing basis  our management also considers several variables associated with the ongoing operations of the business  including  among other things new sales including the mix of contract and event sales and existing business retention objectives necessary to maintain the company s high percentage of contract and other recurring revenues  storage and permitted landbase available to efficiently manage land application of biosolids  especially during inclement weather patterns  regulatory and permit compliance requirements and safety programs and initiatives specific to our business  and reviewing and monitoring utility costs  fuel costs  subcontractor transportation costs  equipment utilization and availability  equipment purchasing activity  headcount  field operating overhead and selling  general and administrative expenses

table of contents revenue and income from operations are summarized by reporting segment  as follows in thousands for the years ended december  revenue residuals management operations rail transportation engineering  facilities  and development eliminations income loss from operations residuals management operations rail transportation engineering  facilities  and development corporate results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or percent 
we have four significant fixed price  long term contracts for which we recognized revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting totaling million in and million in with related gross margin totaling million in and million in the four significant contracts included a million project for the design and construction of a biosolids dryer facility  a million contract for the removal and disposal of cleanwater residuals from a lagoon over a two year period  a million contract for the removal and disposal of biosolids from a lagoon over a five year period and a million contract for the installation of a dewatering facility that was substantially completed in these types of contracts occur infrequently but have a significant impact on reported revenues and earnings 
the revenue recognized for construction of the new dryer facility and the dewatering facility is reported as design build construction revenue  while the revenue recognized for removing and disposing of bio solids from the lagoon over a multi year period is reported as contract revenue and the revenue recognized for the removal of clean water residuals over a two year period is being reported as event revenues 
design build construction revenues increased million primarily due to a million increase in construction revenue on the honolulu dryer facility project  which is expected to be completed and operational by the second quarter of and million increase for construction of a dewatering facility in knoxville  tennessee 
contract revenues increased million compared to the prior year due to a million increase in revenues from the sacramento dryer facility that commenced operations in december  a million increase related to a new disposal contract and million of other contract changes  offset by an expected million decrease in revenue on a long term cleanout job 
event revenues decreased million due to an expected year over year decrease in the number of large event projects in compared to  partially offset by million of revenue in under a million clean water lagoon cleanout project that is expected to take approximately two years to complete 
purchase order and product sales revenues decreased by million due primarily to a decrease in purchase order work for soil cleanup projects 
our residuals management operations revenues for the year ended december   decreased approximately million or percent to million compared to million for the same period in due primarily to the decreases in contract and event revenues 
these decreases were anticipated going into the year as in process and pre sold event work was higher at the beginning of than and there was million of contract revenue recognized in on a long term cleanout contract accounted for using the percentage of completion accounting method that did not generate any significant revenue in our rail transportation revenues for the year ended december   increased approximately million or percent to million 
table of contents compared to million for the same period in due primarily to a million increase related to a new disposal contract partially offset by a decrease in event and purchase order revenues from disposal services 
our engineering  facilities  and development revenues for the year ended december   increased approximately million to million compared to million in due primarily to a million increase in construction revenues on a new dryer facility in honolulu  and a million increase in revenues on the sacramento dryer facility that commenced operations in december  partially offset by the transfer of the pinellas dryer facility operations to the residuals management operations segment 
gross profit for the year ended december   was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to percent in from percent in this decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin is a result of revenue mix changes associated with an increase in low margin construction revenue and the decrease in higher margin contract including the million decrease in revenue on the long term cleanout contract that had higher than normal margins and event revenue  along with a million increase in the cost of utilities for certain facilities and a million increase in depreciation  partially offset by a decrease in facility repair and maintenance costs and a reduction in insurance expense due to lower claims activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   were approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were percent for the year ended december   a slight decrease from the same period of the decrease relates primarily to favorable net reserve adjustments of million  offset by an increase in costs to implement section of the sarbanes oxley act totaling million 
transaction costs incurred in connection with the recapitalization consisted of million in legal  accounting and underwriting fees 
stock option redemptions and transaction bonuses included million of cash paid for transaction bonuses and million for stock options redeemed for certain of our key employees 
restricted stock awards totaling million in  represents compensation expense for grants of restricted stock to certain key employees pursuant to the terms of a new incentive compensation plan approved in connection with the recapitalization that results in grants of shares of our common stock at dividend payments dates see note 
gain on the sale of assets of million was million higher than in  due primarily to planned sales of certain real estate 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million in the same period in our residuals management operations income from operations for the year ended december   totaled approximately million compared to million for due primarily to the expected decreases in event and contract revenues including the decrease in the long term cleanout contract revenue described above along with a million increase in depreciation expense and the million increase in facility utility costs  partially offset by a decrease in facility repair and maintenance costs  a reduction in insurance expense due to lower claims activity and million increase in gains on asset sales 
our rail transportation income from operations decreased from million in to million in due primarily to an increase in rail transportation costs and excess equipment capacity 
our engineering  facilities  and development income from operations increased from a loss of approximately million in to income of approximately million in due primarily to margin from design build construction revenue generated on the honolulu facility and the first year of operations of the sacramento dryer facility revenue and other revenue changes described above and related margins 
other expense  net  was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   representing an increase in other expense of approximately million  due primarily to the million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the recapitalization 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately million compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was approximately percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to a percent decrease associated with the increase in the expected statutory rates that will be applied when temporary differences turn in future periods following a legal entity restructuring in the fourth quarter of  and a percent decrease associated with a tax issue identified during a tax audit related to net operating loss carryforwards that has been fully reserved  along with permanent differences for state taxes  meals and entertainment and similar items that are not deductible for federal tax purposes and therefore reduce the benefit recognized in loss periods 
our tax provision is principally a deferred tax provision that will not significantly impact cash flow because we have significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions and net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million compared to approximately million for  an increase of approximately million  or percent 
we have two significant fixed price  long term contracts for which we recognized revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting totaling million in and million in and related gross margin totaling million in and million in one contract is a million project for the design and construction of a biosolids dryer facility and the other contract is a million project for the removal and disposal of biosolids from a lagoon over a five year period 
these types of contracts occur infrequently and also have a significant impact on reported revenues and earnings 
the revenue recognized for construction of the new dryer facility is reported as design build construction revenue  while the revenue recognized for removing and disposing of bio solids from the lagoon over a multi year period is reported as contract revenue 
approximately million of the increase in revenues related to an percent increase in contract service revenues  approximately million of the increase related to design build construction work and approximately million of the increase was associated with event revenues 
contract revenues include million of revenue recognized in on the lagoon cleanout contract discussed above that is being completed over a five year period 
the remaining million of revenue on this project is expected to be recognized over the next four years as the project is completed 
excluding this work  contract revenues increased percent in compared to design build construction revenues include million of revenue recognized in and million of revenue recognized in on construction of the new dryer facility discussed above that is being completed over a multi year period 
the remaining million of revenue on this project is expected to be recognized in when this project is expected to be completed 
these revenue increases were partially offset by declines in product sales and purchase order revenues 
our residuals management operations revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or percent  to million compared to million for due primarily to the approximately million increase in contract revenue described above  including the million of revenue recognized in on the lagoon cleanout contract 
our rail transportation revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or percent  to million compared to million for due primarily to a decrease in event revenues from cleanout services 
our efd revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million to million compared to million for due primarily to an increase in design build construction revenues associated with construction of the new dryer facility in honolulu  hawaii  and the startup of a new dryer facility in pinellas county  florida 
gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for  an increase of approximately million  or percent 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense described below  a one time settlement gain of million and higher construction revenues as a percentage of total revenues in gross profit in dollars increased due to increased revenues  an improvement in land application margins which benefited from more normal weather patterns in compared to and a significant improvement on cleanout and other event margins  partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance expenses at our drying and incineration facilities  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  
table of contents and a million decrease related to a one time non cash gain associated with a positive settlement of a warranty obligation recorded as a reduction of cost of operations in in  land application margins were negatively impacted by unusually inclement weather primarily on the east coast  which increased our storage  landfill and transportation costs significantly as we were not able to efficiently access our landbase 
fiscal was one of the wettest years on record in the mid atlantic and southeast states 
land application margins returned to expected levels in as we experienced more normal weather patterns this year 
cleanout margins were in line with our internal expectations in  and significantly improved over margins which were negatively impacted by certain large cleanout jobs that experienced cost overruns 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or percent 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to percent in from percent in the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to a million provision for bad debts recognized in versus a million provision recognized in  a reduction in overhead and certain administrative functions implemented in the fourth quarter of  which were partially offset by increased incentive compensation and commissions related to improved operating results in the reduction in certain administrative functions resulted from a management review of our overhead structure in response to the lower than expected operating results for gain loss on sale of assets increased by million primarily as a result of a gain on the sale of land in june as a result of the reduction of overhead and certain administrative functions in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in reorganization costs in related to severance and termination costs 
no such costs were recorded in we incurred a special charge of million for costs associated with the re audit of our financial statements during the third quarter of there was no such special charge during amortization of intangibles decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in the amortization in resulted from the write off of million of due diligence costs on potential acquisitions that were not consummated 
there were no such write offs in as a result of the foregoing  income from operations for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million in  an increase of approximately million  or percent 
our residuals management operations income from operations increased from million in to million in due primarily to the increase in contract and event revenues described above and the improvement in land application and event gross profit margins described above 
our rail transportation income from operations decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the decrease in revenues described above and an increase in rail and overhead costs 
our efd loss from operations decreased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in due primarily to the increase in construction revenues and the startup of a new dryer facility described above 
other expense  net for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease relates primarily to a reduction of million in interest expense related to reductions in debt and savings associated with interest rate swaps 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million compared to million in the prior year 
our effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the decrease in other non deductible expenses  including meals and entertainment expenses 
our provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes 
our tax provision is principally a deferred tax provision that will not significantly impact cash flow since we have significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions and net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income 

table of contents as a result of the foregoing  net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting for asset retirement obligations and preferred stock dividends increased to approximately million for compared to approximately million in liquidity and capital resources overview during the past three years  our principal sources of funds were cash generated from our operating activities 
we use cash mainly for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and dividends 
in the future  we expect that we will use cash principally to fund working capital  our debt service and repayment obligations  capital expenditures and payment of our dividends 
in addition  we may use cash to pay potential earn out payments resulting from prior acquisitions 
we have historically financed our acquisitions principally through the issuance of equity and debt securities  our credit facility  and funds provided by operating activities 
historical cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
for the year ended december   cash flows used by operating activities was approximately million compared to approximately million provided by operating activities for the same period in  a decrease of approximately million  or percent 
the decrease primarily relates to the net loss applicable to common stock of million primarily resulting from million of charges related to the recapitalization including transaction costs of million  transaction bonuses and stock option redemptions of million and debt extinguishment costs of million compared to net income of million in the same period in in addition  we had an increase in the use of working capital of million 
the increase in working capital relates primarily to a million decrease in trade payables between periods  a million decrease in interest payable due to the repayment of debt as part of the recapitalization  a million increase in trade receivables  a million increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  a million decrease in benefits accruals relating to the timing of cutoff of payroll between periods and lower bonus accruals  and other decreases in deferred revenues  legal and insurance reserves and other liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities increased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately million  or percent 
the increase primarily relates to a million increase in net income applicable to common stock  a million increase in noncash charges related to depreciation and amortization expense and deferred income taxes and a reduction of cash required for working capital of million 
accounts receivable and current cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings as a percentage of total annual revenue increased from percent at december  to percent at december  this increase is primarily related to an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of approximately million on two contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings was offset by an increase in accounts payable including payments to subcontractors which were not made in until payments on related construction billings were received from the customer in  accrued expenses for incentive compensation  insurance premiums and reserves  and other reserves 
the increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings relates to two contracts that are being accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred on the project multiplied by the contract price 
cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents the amount of revenue recognized on these projects in excess of what has been billed to date as provided in the underlying contract 
cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method increased approximately million during due to a significant amount of revenue recognized for activity on these contracts in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in excess of amounts billable under the terms of the related contracts 
cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings were not significant prior to june   because we did not have any significant activity on our percentage of completion contracts during the first half of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings totaled million at december   of which approximately million will 
table of contents not be billable in fiscal and million at december   of which approximately million was not billable in fiscal under the terms of the related contract and has therefore been included in non current assets 
costs incurred on these contracts are expected to be covered by billings and related cash receipts in and are therefore not expected to significantly impact our liquidity in there have not been any significant changes to the scope of the work or the payment terms of these four contracts and there are no payment related disputes on these four contracts 
the increase in accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings is believed to be fully collectable and thus no additional increase to allowance for doubtful accounts has been deemed necessary 
cash flows from investing activities 
for the year ended december   cash flows used by investing activities increased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately million 
this increase is due primarily to a million increase in capital expenditures partially offset by a million increase in proceeds from asset sales and a million increase in the use of cash restricted for capital projects 
the increase in capital expenditures relates to million of capital spent excluding a project funded from restricted cash on new facility projects compared to million spent in the same period last year  and a million increase in other capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   cash flows used by investing activities increased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately million 
the increase primarily relates to a million decrease in proceeds from asset sales in compared to  and a million increase in capital expenditures partially offset by a million decrease in acquisition spending we completed an acquisition in the second quarter of 
cash flows from financing activities 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities were approximately million compared to cash flows used of approximately million for the same period in  an increase of approximately million 
the increase primarily relates to proceeds of million received from the equity offering see note  million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options in  proceeds from our new senior secured credit facility net of the repayment of debt and debt issuance costs related to the recapitalization  less million of dividends paid in  compared to million of net payments on debt in for the year ended december   cash flows used by financing activities decreased to approximately million from approximately million for the same period in  a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease primarily relates to a million decrease in debt issuance costs partially offset by a million increase in net repayments on debt totaling approximately million during  compared to million during capital expenditure requirements capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled approximately million which included approximately million for new facilities compared to approximately million which included million for new facilities  including million to fund construction of the sacramento biosolids processing facility in the same period of our ongoing capital expenditure program consists of expenditures for replacement equipment  betterments  and growth 
we expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately million  including new facility capital spending of million and the balance represents ongoing capital expenditures 
debt service requirements senior credit facility on june   we closed a new million senior secured credit facility the senior credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions  including affiliates of banc of america securities llc  lehman brothers inc and cibc world markets corp 
a portion of the proceeds received from the senior credit facility were used to repay our million amended and restated senior credit agreement  entered into on may  by and among the company  bank of america  na and certain other lenders the senior credit agreement 

table of contents the loan commitments under the senior credit facility are as follows i revolving loan revolver up to million outstanding at anytime  ii term b loans which  once repaid  may not be reborrowed of million including million that was borrowed in december  and iii letters of credit up to million as a subset of the revolving loan 
at december   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
the revolver has a five year maturity and the term loan has a seven year maturity 
the senior credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries other than assets securing nonrecourse debt and expires on december  there is no amortization of the term loan 
the term loan bears interest at libor or prime rate plus a margin percent for eurodollar loans  and percent for base rate loans  and the revolver bears interest at libor or prime rate plus a margin based on a rate schedule currently percent for eurodollar loans  and percent for base rate loans 
as of december   these rates total approximately eurodollar base rate revolver term as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings on the revolver 
a portion of the proceeds from the senior credit facility was used to repay in full indebtedness under our senior credit agreement and to tender for all of our million of outstanding percent senior subordinated notes due april  the notes 
the senior credit facility allows us to pay a significant portion of our excess cash flow to shareholders through cash dividends provided we maintain compliance with certain financial covenants and certain other restrictions 
the proceeds of the million term loan drawn in december will be used to partially fund new facility construction costs in and we have several new facilities under development that are scheduled to begin operations in the next to months 
these new facilities will be operated under long term contracts 
the development of these new facilities is consistent with our strategy to pursue new facility opportunities that provide long term  highly predictable cash flows 
these facilities include a composting facility in kern county  california  an incineration facility upgrade in woonsocket  rhode island  a dewatering facility in providence  rhode island  a dryer facility in honolulu  hawaii and a composting facility in los palos  california 
the senior credit facility includes mandatory repayment provisions related to excess cash flows  proceeds from certain asset sales  debt issuances and equity issuances  all as defined in the senior credit facility 
these mandatory repayment provisions may also reduce the available commitment 
the senior credit facility contains standard covenants including compliance with laws  limitations on capital expenditures  restrictions on dividend payments  limitations on mergers and compliance with financial covenants 
we were in compliance with those covenants as of december  as of december   we had approximately million of unused borrowings under the senior credit facility 
on march   we amended its senior credit facility to  among other things  increase the maximum amount of debt permitted under the leverage ratio and to decrease the minimum amount of interest coverage required under the interest coverage ratio 
senior subordinated notes in april  we issued the notes  which were unsecured senior indebtedness and were guaranteed by all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries  other than subsidiaries treated as unrestricted subsidiaries guarantors 
as of december   all subsidiaries  other than the subsidiaries formed to own and operate the sacramento dryer project  synagro organic fertilizer company of sacramento  inc and sacramento project finance  inc 
and south kern industrial center  llc  were guarantors of the notes 
on june   the notes were repurchased with the proceeds of the senior credit facility

the capital leases have lease terms of four to six years with interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
the net book value of the equipment related to these capital leases totaled approximately million as of december  the operating leases have terms 
table of contents of two to eight years 
additionally  we have guaranteed a maximum lease risk amount to the lessor of one of the operating leases

recent accounting pronouncements in december  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation was revised sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions and requires that companies record compensation expense for employee stock option awards 
sfas no 
r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we anticipate that the impact of adopting sfas no 
r will result in annual expense in of approximately million

sfas no 
is amended to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued during fiscal years beginning after september  we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following are our significant estimates and assumptions made in preparation of our financial statements that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts receivables based on the aging of the accounts receivable and the evaluation and the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable 
accounts receivables are written off periodically during the year as they are deemed uncollectible when collection efforts have been unsuccessful 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was approximately million and million  respectively and is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivables 
loss contracts we evaluate our revenue producing contracts to determine whether the projected revenues of such contracts exceed the direct cost to service such contracts 
these evaluations include estimates of the future revenues and expenses 
accruals for loss contracts are adjusted based on these evaluations 
an accrual for loss contracts was not required as of december  long term construction contracts certain long term construction projects are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting and accordingly revenues are recorded based on estimates of total costs to be incurred under the contract 
we typically subcontract a portion of the work to subcontractors under fixed 
table of contents price contracts 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed under the terms of contracts accounted for on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
these amounts are billable upon completion of contract performance milestones or other specified conditions of the contract 
property and equipment long lived assets property and equipment is reviewed for impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the carrying amount of an asset group is considered impaired if it exceeds the sum of our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  excluding interest charges 
we did not have any asset impairments under the provisions of sfas no 
as of december  we regularly incur costs to develop potential projects or facilities and procure contracts for the design  permitting  construction and operations of facilities 
we recorded million in property and long term assets related to these activities at december   compared to million at december  approximately million and million are classified as construction in progress as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease as of december  is primarily due to the sacramento biosolids facility which commenced operations in december and is now being depreciated 
as required under current accounting standards  we routinely review the status of each of these projects to determine if these costs are realizable 
goodwill goodwill attributable to our reporting units is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
significant estimates used in the determination of fair value include estimates of future cash flows  future growth rates  costs of capital and estimates of market multiples 
as required under current accounting standards  we test for impairment annually at year end unless factors otherwise indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we did not have any impairments under the provisions of sfas no 
as of december  purchase accounting we estimate the fair value of assets  including property  machinery and equipment and its related useful lives and salvage values  and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
as of december   we had generated net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future income taxes 
these carryforwards begin to expire in a change in ownership  as defined by federal income tax regulations  could significantly limit our ability to utilize our carryforwards 
accordingly  our ability to utilize our nols to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities may be limited 
additionally  because federal tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
we estimate that our effective tax rate in will approximate percent of pre tax income 
substantially all of our tax provision over the next several years is expected to be deferred in nature due to significant tax deductions in excess of book deductions for goodwill and depreciation 
legal and contingency accruals we estimate and accrue the amount of probable exposure we may have with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on management s assessment of the facts and the probabilities of the ultimate resolution of the litigation 
derivatives we have entered into various interest rate swap and cap arrangements to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we estimate the fair value of these interest rate swaps using market data  information provided by the counterparties to these arrangements and other information  as necessary 
self insurance reserves we are substantially self insured for workers compensation  employers liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are 
table of contents estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends  industry averages and actuarial assumptions regarding future claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material transactions that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement  other than operating leases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize financial instruments  which inherently have some degree of market risk due to interest rate fluctuations 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not currently use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
derivatives and hedging activities effective january   we entered into a new interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of million whereby we receive three month libor and pay three month libor unless three month libor settles above percent  in such event we would pay percent 
we paid  to execute this cap 
this agreement expires may we chose not to designate this arrangement as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in its fair value are recorded in other expense 
effective july   we entered into two interest rate agreements 
the first is an interest rate collar agreement on a notional amount of million  whereby we will receive three month libor and pay three month libor unless three month libor settles below percent or above percent  in either such event we would pay percent or percent  as applicable 
this swap s value was approximately million at december   accordingly  approximately million has been recorded in other expense 
this swap expires november we chose not to designate this arrangement as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in its fair value are recorded in other expense 
also effective july   we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of million whereby we will receive three month libor and pay three month libor unless three month libor settles above percent in which case we would pay percent 
we paid  to execute this cap 
at december   this cap has a fair market value of approximately million  accordingly  approximately  has been recorded in other expense 
this cap expires may we chose not to designate this arrangement as a hedge 
accordingly  changes in its fair value are recorded in other expense 
during the second quarter of  we entered into three forward starting fixed rate swap agreements which are not effective until november   and mature in may the notional amount for each fixed rate swap is million  and the fixed rates of interest are percent  percent  and percent 
these swaps are considered to be cash flow hedges and accordingly the fair value adjustments will be recorded to other comprehensive income 
the aggregate liability for the fair value of these agreements was approximately million at december  this amount  net of tax  totals approximately million which has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  on july   we entered into two interest rate swap transactions with two financial institutions to hedge our exposure to changes in the fair value on million of our notes 
the purpose of these transactions was to convert future interest due on million of the notes to a lower variable rate in an attempt to realize savings on our future interest payments 
the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying debt instruments were identical 
we designated these swap agreements as fair value hedges 
on september   we unwound million of these swaps and received a settlement payment of approximately million that was deducted from interest expense 
on january   we unwound the remaining million of interest rate swaps and paid 
table of contents million for the settlement of these swaps 
at june  the fair value adjustment to the subordinated debt relating to these swaps was million and was written off in connection with the recapitalization 
we previously had outstanding percent subordinated debt which was repaid on april   with the proceeds from the sale of the notes 
on june   we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement that substantially offsets market value changes in our reverse swap agreement 
the liability related to this reverse swap agreement and the floating to fixed offset agreement totaling approximately million is reflected in other long term liabilities at december  the loss recognized during related to the floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement was approximately million  while the gain recognized related to the reverse swap agreement was approximately million 
the amount of the ineffectiveness of the reverse swap agreement charged to other expense was approximately  for the year ended december  on june   we entered into a reverse swap on our percent subordinated debt and used the proceeds from the reverse swap agreement to retire previously outstanding floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements the retired swaps and option agreements 
accordingly  the balance included in accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders equity related to the retired swaps is being recognized in future periods income over the remaining term of the original swap agreement 
the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income charged to interest expense during was approximately million 
on june   we wrote off the balance included in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million related to the retired swaps as a result of the recapitalization 
interest rate risk total debt at december   included million in floating rate debt at a base interest rate plus libor 
as a result  our interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a percent change in the floating rate ie libor would be approximately million
