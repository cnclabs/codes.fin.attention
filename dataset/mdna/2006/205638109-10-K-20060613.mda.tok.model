numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operating results  including  without limitation  those discussed in item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this report  and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
overview in this section  we discuss our results of operations on a segment basis for each of our financial reporting segments 
we operate in two business segments in the technology industry products and professional services 
we evaluate segment performance based primarily on segment contribution before corporate expenses 
references to years are to fiscal years ended march this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of this report 
we deliver value to businesses worldwide by providing software products and professional services that increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the entire it organization 
originally founded as a professional services company  in the late s we began to offer mainframe productivity tools for fault management and diagnosis  file and database management  and application debugging 
in the s  the it industry moved toward distributed and web based platforms 
our solutions portfolio grew in response  and we now market a comprehensive portfolio of it solutions across the full range of enterprise computing platforms that help develop and deliver high quality  high performance enterprise business applications in a timely and cost effective manner 
measure and manage application service using business relevant metrics  and maintain consistent  high levels of service delivery 
provide executive visibility  decision support and process automation across the entire it organization to enable all available resources to be harnessed in alignment with business priorities 
additionally  to be competitive in today s global economy  enterprises must securely share applications  information and business processes 
we address this market need through our covisint offerings  which help manage the supply chain through the integration of vital business information and processes between partners  customers and suppliers 
we focus on growing revenue and profit margins by enhancing and promoting our current product lines  expanding our product and service offerings through key acquisitions  developing strategic partnerships in order to provide clients with our product solutions and managing our costs 
the following occurred since the beginning of fiscal acquired providerlink technologies providerlink in march providerlink offers technology that improves efficiency in the sharing of healthcare information and records 
acquired adlex  incorporated adlex in may adlex has pioneered service delivery management technology that enables internet service providers and enterprise customers to diagnose and then manage the quality of service that business critical applications deliver to end users 
this technology complements the compuware vantage product line by providing extremely high capacity  agentless end user experience monitoring and deep insight into application performance 
released mainframe and distributed product enhancements  during fiscal  designed to increase the productivity of the it departments of our customers 
achieved a products contribution margin of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the primary reason for the improved contribution margin was reductions in technology development and support expense and sales and marketing expense 
achieved an increase in distributed product revenue compared to fiscal the increase was a reflection of our continued focus on promoting our distributed products and an expanding maintenance base for those products 
incurred a decrease in mainframe product revenue compared to fiscal primarily related to a decline in license revenue 
improved the professional services margin to in fiscal from in fiscal through improved utilization of professional services personnel and  to a lesser extent  a concerted effort to reduce low margin subcontractor arrangements 
repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
entered into license and maintenance agreements under the ibm settlement for approximately million 
the remaining balance of million from the commitment of million was reported as settlement in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company implemented the following management reorganization henry jallos was appointed president and chief operating officer for compuware products 
in this role  mr 
jallos will be responsible for the sales and maintenance of all compuware products 
andrew trestrail was appointed president and chief operating officer for compuware services 
in this role  mr 
trestrail will be responsible for the sales and delivery of all compuware services

this reorganization will allow compuware to take advantage of the unique strengths of its management team that will result in greater focus  accountability and responsiveness to the needs of our customers 
our ability to achieve our strategies and objectives is subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control

product revenue which consists of software license fees and maintenance fees  comprised  and of total revenue during  and  respectively 
distributed software product revenue increased million or during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the increase during was primarily due to license and revenue growth related to our vantage product line resulting from increased customer demand for performance related software and the enhancement of vantage to include agentless monitoring through software acquired in our adlex acquisition 
the increase during when compared with was primarily due to an increase of million in maintenance revenue related to our devpartner and vantage product lines and to the addition of million related to changepoint  which was acquired during the first quarter of mainframe software product revenue decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased  or during from million in the decrease during was primarily due to a decrease in license revenue related to our expediter and file aid product lines 
license revenue decreased million or during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in fluctuations in foreign currencies negatively impacted license revenue by million in compared to excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency fluctuations  license revenue decreased during the decrease  net of currency fluctuations  was primarily due to a reduction in expediter and file aid product lines offset by growth in our vantage product line as discussed above

excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency fluctuations  maintenance revenue increased during the increase  net of currency fluctuations  was primarily a result of revenue growth in our distributed product lines and to the effects of the addition of changepoint 
we license software to customers using two types of software licenses  perpetual and term 
generally  perpetual software licenses allow customers a perpetual right to run our software on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips millions of instructions per second capacity or to run our distributed software for a specified number of users or servers 
term licenses allow customers a right to run our software for a limited period of time on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips capacity or for a specific number of users or servers 
also  our customers purchase maintenance services that provide technical support and advice  including problem resolution services and assistance in product installation  error corrections and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period 
furthermore  based on customers business needs  we enter into agreements with our customers that allow them to license additional software and purchase multiple years of maintenance in a single transaction multi year transactions 
in support of these multi year transactions  we allow extended payment terms to qualifying customers 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been delivered to the customer and collection is reasonably probable 
license revenue associated with term transactions or with certain transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement or when all revenue recognition criteria have been met  depending on the terms of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
product revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total product revenue    product contribution and expenses financial information for the product segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    product contribution    the product segment generated contribution margins of  and during  and  respectively 
the improved contribution margin during compared to was primarily due to reductions in product expenses 
product expenses include cost of software license fees  technology development and support costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
these factors are discussed below 
cost of software license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of duplicating and disseminating products to customers and the cost of author royalties 
cost of software license fees decreased million or  during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decreases in costs for and were primarily due to a reduction in amortization expense related to capitalized software acquired as a result of the fiscal programart acquisition that became fully amortized in september as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in  and  respectively 
technology development and support includes  primarily  the costs of programming personnel associated with product development and support less the amount of software development costs capitalized during the period 
also included here are personnel costs associated with developing and maintaining internal systems and hardware software costs required to support all technology initiatives 
as a percentage of product revenue  costs of technology development and support were  and in  and  respectively 
capitalization of internally developed software products begins when technological feasibility of the product is established 
total technology development and support costs incurred internally and capitalized for the years ended march   and were as follows in thousands year ended march  technology development and support costs incurred    capitalized technology development and support costs    technology development and support costs reported    before the capitalization of internally developed software products  total technology development and support expenditures decreased million or  to million during from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decreases in costs for and were primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefit costs due to reductions in employee headcount in this area 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with product sales and sales support and marketing for all our offerings 
sales and marketing costs decreased million or  during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in as a percentage of product revenue  sales and marketing costs were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in costs for was primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit and bonus costs due to a first quarter sales realignment that reduced headcount 
the increase in costs for when compared with was primarily attributable to higher compensation and benefit costs and an increase in marketing seminar costs related to the ojx seminar that was held at our detroit world headquarters for the first time in to promote our optimalj product line 
compensation and benefit costs were higher due to scheduled salary increases during and the negative effect of foreign currency fluctuations on these costs as the us dollar continued to weaken throughout approximately of total sales and marketing compensation and benefits were attributable to our foreign operations 
professional services revenue we offer a broad range of it services to help businesses make the most of their it assets 
some of these services include outsourcing and co sourcing  application management  product solutions  project management  enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management services 
revenue from professional services decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decrease in revenue for was primarily due to reduced spending from local and state government agencies related to budget reductions on it programs and to reduced spending by the automotive sector primarily related to cost cutting initiatives adopted by domestic automotive manufacturers and suppliers 
the decrease in revenue for when compared with was primarily due to a reduction in demand for professional services  continued downward pressure on our billing rates due to the highly competitive nature of the professional services market and a reduction in subcontractor arrangements  along with a strategic move away from non core professional services such as helpdesk  computer operations and non technical project management 
professional services revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total professional services revenue    professional services contribution and expenses financial information for the professional services segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    professional services contribution    during  the professional services segment generated a contribution margin of  compared to and during and  respectively 
the increases in and were primarily due to improved utilization of professional services personnel and  to a lesser extent  a concerted effort to reduce low margin subcontractor projects 
cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel related costs of providing services  including billable staff  subcontractors and sales personnel 
cost of professional services decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decreases in costs for and were primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs of approximately million and million  respectively due to a reduction in employee headcount in this area and reductions in subcontractor costs of approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce low margin subcontractor projects 
corporate and other expenses administrative and general expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the corporate executive  finance  human resources  administrative  legal  communications and investor relations departments 
in addition  administrative and general expenses include all facility related costs  such as rent  building depreciation  maintenance  utilities  etc  associated with worldwide sales and professional services offices 
administrative and general expenses decreased million or during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the decrease in cost for was primarily due to a million decline in external legal fees and litigation settlement  partially offset by the effects of a million impairment charge related to our former headquarters building in farmington hills  michigan 
the decrease in external legal fees and litigation costs are primarily due to reduced legal costs associated with the ibm litigation partially offset by the effects of an unfavorable verdict against the company that occurred in the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the decrease in cost for when compared with was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal fees of approximately million due to reduced legal costs associated with the ibm litigation offset by an increase in charitable contributions of million  an increase in compensation and benefits of million due to salary increases and higher depreciation expense associated with the detroit headquarters building of approximately million 
external legal fees for all litigation  including ibm and other matters were million  million and million in  and litigation expense was impacted significantly during fiscal and by the ibm litigation 
in march  we entered into a software  services and technology relationship with ibm and settled all outstanding litigation between the companies 
other income  net other income consists primarily of interest income realized from investments  interest earned on deferred customer receivables  income associated with the ibm settlement agreement and income losses generated from our investments in partially owned companies 
other income increased million or during to million from million in and increased million or during from million in the increase in income for was primarily attributable to a million increase in investment interest income  of which million was due to higher interest rates earned on investments and million was due to having a higher average investment balance throughout compared to in addition  we recorded million to other income related to the ibm settlement  representing the portion of the ibm settlement payment for the year that did not relate to the sale of products or services 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
the income tax provision was million  million and million  respectively  in  and which represents an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
during the quarter ended march   we reduced our income tax provision by million for certain items related to the settlement of prior year tax matters 
we have concluded two separate competent authority proceedings  both spanning several tax periods 
the us government for each matter and two separate foreign government competent authority groups have resolved these foreign country initiated adjustments related to transfer pricing for software 
this resulted in a reduction to our income tax provision of approximately million 
these proceedings covered tax periods through and through  respectively 
also during the quarter  we concluded several matters with the us internal revenue service irs related to its ongoing examination for tax periods through with the most significant being the us research and experimentation tax credit and claims for deductions of meals and entertainment expenditures 
the resolution of these matters resulted in reductions to our income tax reserves of approximately million and  respectively 
other items totaling approximately  relating to prior year tax matters were also settled during the quarter 
excluding the million tax benefit  the effective tax rate for was 
during the quarter ended december   we adjusted our income tax reserves related to various tax matters 
this adjustment resulted in an income tax benefit of million in relating primarily to favorable tax settlements with the irs and developments in other tax matters both in the us and other taxing jurisdictions 
we recorded a net tax benefit of million related to the completion of an irs exam which challenged the deductibility of interest paid on corporate owned life insurance coli policies 
we entered into a closing agreement with the irs on this matter in october all coli policies have been cancelled 
the balance of the adjustment related to revisions in estimates for reserves related to the us research and experimentation tax credit  an audit of our australian operations for fiscal years through  and other income tax reserves no longer deemed necessary 
excluding the million tax benefit  the effective tax rate for was 
the effective income tax rates for  and are below the statutory rate due to the impact of certain tax benefits discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
we expect changes in pre tax net income and in the domestic foreign composition of revenue to change the relative effect of these tax benefits and to result in an increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate from to  excluding the million income tax benefit  is primarily due to changes in income before income taxes and in the domestic foreign composition of revenue reducing the effect of certain tax benefits compared to the prior year 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan to reorganize our operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
these changes were designed to increase profitability by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  for changes in the restructuring accrual for  and management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies described below with the audit committee 
product revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
future events or inaccuracies in reported credit data that result in a change to collectibility expectations could have a negative effect on our operating results 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including statement of position software revenue recognition and modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin and emerging issues task force issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg maintenance and professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and professional services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
we have an increasing need for flexibility in licensing rights and offerings to our customers 
as our contractual arrangements evolve to meet the needs of our customers  an increasing percentage of our license arrangements must be recognized over the terms of the arrangement 
while this ratable recognition has no impact on our results over time  it may change the timing of forecasted revenue and impact quarterly and annual results 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates 
therefore  revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed  provided that collection of the related receivable is deemed probable 
however  for services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
certain professional services contracts include a project and on going support for the project 
revenue associated with these contracts is recognized over the support period as the customer derives value from the services  consistent with the proportional performance method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete such projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
unforeseen events which negatively affect the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations would negatively impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts due from customers and may cause a material impact on our financial position and results of operations due to a change in the assumptions and judgment on which we base this estimate 
capitalized software in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product which is generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future product revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurred or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we review for impairments each balance sheet date 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
to analyze goodwill  we measure its fair value using an estimate of the related business s discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill associated with such reporting unit must be further evaluated for impairment 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
investments in partially owned companies as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  we have minority investments in and advances to certain privately held companies for strategic purposes 
at march   the net carrying value of our investments and advances to these entities totaled million 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of these partially owned companies to assess potential impairment in the carrying value of our investments in and advances to these entities 
we consider their current financial situation  including their ability to meet current cash requirements  expected future cash flows and any other information known to us in determining whether an impairment charge is appropriate 
unknown factors or unforeseen events that impair their ability to pay their obligations or to operate profitably could have an impact on our ability to recoup our investments in and outstanding advances to these companies and could require us to expense all or a portion of the outstanding investments and advances in that period 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
as a result  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events and are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and  to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
for additional information regarding these matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 
in addition  we recognize contingent tax liabilities through tax expense for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions 
we evaluate the need for contingent tax liabilities on a quarterly basis and any change in the amount will be recorded in our results of operations  as appropriate 
it could take several years to resolve certain of these contingencies 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million 
during and  cash flow from operations was million and million  respectively 
during these periods  capital expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized research and software development totaled million and million  respectively

during fiscal  we implemented a plan to market and sell the former headquarters building located in farmington hills  michigan 
we have been unable to reach an agreement with a buyer to dispose of the building 
based on various purchase discussions with potential buyers  we recorded a million impairment charge related to this building in this impairment charge is included in administrative and general in the consolidated statements of operations 
the building is classified in current assets as held for sale with a carrying value of million at march  during fiscal  we implemented a plan to market and sell the former distribution center located in west bloomfield  michigan

we believe available cash resources  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet cash needs for the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation effective for annual periods beginning after june  we expect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r as of april  using the modified prospective method to recognize compensation expense 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as described in the disclosure of stock based compensation in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity or as available for sale which does not expose the consolidated statements of operations to fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except interest rate year ended march  fair value at total march  cash equivalents    average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent investments     average interest rate average interest rate tax equivalent we offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our multi year software sales 
installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  and are due approximately million  million  million  million and million in each of the years ending march  through  respectively 
the fair value of non current accounts receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which the company would finance a similar transaction 
at march   the fair value of such receivables is approximately million 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated million and million negative impact on the fair value of non current accounts receivable based on the balance of such receivables at march  and  respectively 
a change in interest rates will have no impact on cash flows or net income associated with non current accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
because of these unhedged exposures  a ten percent change in exchange rate would have an associated million and million impact on our income from operations based on our unhedged amounts due to or from select subsidiaries as of march  and  respectively

this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies related to the fair value of foreign assets and liabilities  net income and cash flows
