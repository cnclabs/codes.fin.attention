we are a global specialty materials company that brings technology and innovation to the market to enhance the performance of end use consumer products made by our customers 
our products are sold primarily for use in the building and construction  electronics  food and retail  household and personal care  industrial processes  packaging  transportation and water markets 
our salt business has one of the most recognizable brand names in the world 
we operate six reportable segments coatings  monomers  performance chemicals  electronic materials  salt and adhesives and sealants 
a year in review represents a record financial performance for the company in both sales and earnings and reflects excellent execution of our strategies to deliver sales and earnings growth 
our performance continues to demonstrate our ability to effectively implement both pricing and portfolio management strategies to respond to extraordinary increases in raw material and energy costs  and to deal effectively with the impact of two gulf coast hurricanes 
significant items affecting the results of our operations include successful pricing initiatives to offset higher raw material  energy and freight costs improving product mix to shed low margin product lines continued cost efficiencies  primarily through restructuring initiatives  to maintain control over manufacturing and selling  administrative and research sar expenses a strengthened balance sheet  and effective cash deployment  including voluntary pension contributions  early debt retirement  stock repurchases and a double digit dividend increase 
in  we reported sales of  million  a increase over we reported earnings from continuing operations in of million  or per share  as compared to earnings from continuing operations of million or per share  reflecting the impact of higher pricing and tighter cost controls 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements when the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
litigation and environmental reserves we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business including employee matters  personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
additionally  we are involved in environmental remediation and spend significant amounts for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with gaap  we are required to assess these 
table of contents matters to determine if a liability is probable  and record such a liability when the financial exposure can be reasonably estimated 
the determination and estimation of these liabilities are critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
in reviewing such matters  we consider a broad range of information  including the claims  demands  settlement offers received from governmental authorities or private parties  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute as well as our prior experience  to determine if a liability is probable and if the value is estimable 
if both of these conditions are met  we record a liability 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses  and disclose any material  reasonably possible  additional losses 
if we determine a liability to be only reasonably possible  we consider the same information to estimate the possible exposure and disclose any material potential liability 
our most significant reserves are those which have been established for remediation and restoration costs associated with environmental damage 
as of december   we have million reserved for environmental related costs 
we conduct studies and site surveys to determine the extent of environmental damage and necessary remediation 
with the expertise of our environmental engineers and legal counsel  we determine our best estimates for remediation and restoration costs 
these estimates are based on forecasts of future costs for remediation and change periodically as additional and better information becomes available 
changes to assumptions and considerations used to calculate remediation reserves could materially affect our results of operations or financial position 
if we determine that the scope of remediation is broader than originally planned  discover new contamination  discover previously unknown sites or become subject to related personal injury or property damage claims  our estimates and assumptions could materially change 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate reserves for both our environmental and other legal liabilities are appropriate 
these estimates are based in large part on information currently available and the current laws and regulations governing these matters 
if additional information becomes available or there are changes to the laws or regulations or actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating our reserves  the resulting change could have a material impact on the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
income taxes the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in the determination of our current year tax provision  we have provided deferred income taxes on income from foreign subsidiaries which have not been reinvested abroad permanently as upon remittance to the united states such earnings are taxable 
for foreign subsidiaries where earnings are permanently reinvested outside the united states  no accrual of income taxes has been provided 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit within these jurisdictions 
we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits 
we adjust these accruals  if necessary  upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 
since significant judgment is required to assess the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  the ultimate resolution of these events could result in adjustments to our financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
therefore  we consider such estimates to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the current year accrued and deferred tax positions are appropriate 
however  if the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
restructuring when appropriate  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our manufacturing footprint and support service functions 
to the extent that exact amounts are not determinable  we have established reserves for such initiatives by calculating our best estimate of employee termination costs utilizing detailed restructuring plans approved by management 
reserve calculations are based upon various factors including an employee s length of service  contract provisions  salary level and health care benefit choices 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to calculate 
table of contents these restructuring provisions are appropriate  and although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs could differ from the assumptions and considerations used in estimating reserves should changes be made in the nature or timing of our restructuring plans 
the resulting change could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings and equipment  long term investments  goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in addition  changes in the expected useful life of these long lived assets may also be an impairment indicator 
as a result  future decisions to change our manufacturing footprint or exit certain businesses could result in material impairment charges 
when such events or changes occur  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the assets use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that we must estimate include assumptions regarding sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic factors 
these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test for recoverability  we typically utilize discounted estimated future cash flows to measure fair value for each reporting unit 
this calculation is highly sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit and the discount rate assumed in these calculations 
these components are discussed below estimated future cash flows the key variables that we must estimate to determine future cash flows include assumptions for sales volume  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
for example  unanticipated changes in competition  customer sourcing requirements and product maturity would all have a significant impact on these estimates 
discount rate we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company  and therefore are beyond our control 
the average wacc utilized in our annual test of goodwill recoverability in may was  which was based upon average business enterprise value 
a change in the wacc will result in an approximate change in the computed fair value of our reporting units 
the following table summarizes the major factors that influenced the rate 
table of contents risk free rate of return cost of debt market risk premium the decrease in risk free rate of return and cost of debt is due to the overall decrease in us long term interest rates between the dates of our annual impairment testing in may and may we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used in the above estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
based on the results of the annual impairment test in  our automotive coatings reporting unit  with goodwill of million  had a fair value only slightly in excess of the book value of its net assets 
accordingly  even a small adverse change in the estimated future cash flows for this business or increases in the wacc rate could result in the fair value falling below the book value of its net assets 
this could result in a material impairment charge 
the fair values of our long term investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest  as well as the volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of these investment entities 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record impairment charges 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used to measure plan obligations and related assets of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans  post retirement benefits  post employment benefits eg medical  disability and other employee liabilities 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  the expected long term rate of return on assets  increases or trends in health care costs and estimated mortality 
we use independent actuaries to assist us in preparing these calculations and determining these assumptions 
we believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate in the current economic environment 
however  if economic conditions change  we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions  and the resulting change could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations and on the balance sheets 
the weighted average discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the estimated return on plan assets used in our determination of plan obligations and pension expense are as follows weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation for years ended december  us us us us discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for years ended december  us us us us us us discount rate estimated return on plan assets rate of compensation increase 
table of contents the following illustrates the annual impact on pension expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the assumptions used to determine the net cost for the year ending december  combined weighted average discount estimated return on increase decrease rate plan assets pension expense in millions us us us us us us basis point increase basis point decrease the following illustrates the annual impact on postretirement benefit expense of a basis point increase or decrease from the discount rate used to determine the net cost for the year ending december  weighted average discount rate in millions us us basis point increase basis point decrease stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimation of the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected dividends  and risk free interest rates 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the first quarter of  we became aware of a provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which resulted in an acceleration of our stock based compensation for retirement eligible employees where our plans provide for immediate vesting of stock based compensation upon their retirement 
this resulted in approximately million pre tax in higher than expected selling and administrative expense for the quarter ended march   of which million related to prior periods

table of contents consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  through december  net sales and gross profits in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million over net sales of  million 
this increase was primarily driven by higher selling prices across most of our businesses and the favorable impact of currencies  partially offset by slightly lower demand

this increase was primarily driven by greater demand across most of our businesses  the impact of favorable foreign currencies and higher selling prices 
from from sales change selling price currency demand volume other total change gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in  on higher sales 
gross profit margin increased in to from in due to higher selling prices necessary to offset higher raw material  operating and energy costs  as well as favorable currencies and product mix 
gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in  on higher sales 
gross profit margin decreased in to from in due to significantly higher raw material and energy costs which were only partially offset by the benefit of higher demand  the favorable impact of currency and higher selling prices 
in addition  the consolidation of a joint venture previously recorded as an equity method investment also had a favorable impact of approximately basis points on gross profit margin 
further information related to this consolidation is discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we anticipate raw material and natural gas prices to exceed levels  however  it is difficult to predict the extent and duration of higher prices 
to mitigate the impact of escalating raw material and energy costs  we have increased selling prices  and we are exercising control over discretionary spending  and utilizing swap  option and collar contracts 
for further information regarding the impact of raw materials on our businesses  please see raw materials on page selling and administrative expense in  selling and administrative expenses increased million or to  million from million in primarily due to higher employee related costs  including a million pre tax adjustment to stock based compensation for retirement eligible employees where our plans provide for immediate vesting upon retirement  increased pension expense  normal salary increases and incentive compensation  and increasing health care costs 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of recent cost savings initiatives as well as a reduction in costs related to the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act of of approximately million 
in  selling and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million in the increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs  including increased pension expense  normal salary increases  increasing health care costs and higher stock based compensation expense  the consolidation of a joint venture previously recorded as an equity method investment as a result of fin  the unfavorable impact of currencies primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar  and higher consulting fees for process reengineering efforts and internal control documentation as part of our efforts to comply with rules under the sarbanes oxley act of these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives 

table of contents we believe that our cost savings initiatives will continue to reduce certain administrative costs as we improve efficiencies 
however  we anticipate overall higher employee related costs in as a result of an increase in pension costs  primarily due to a change in the mortality table being used to calculate pension expense from the to the mortality table  as well as a decline in discount rates  normal salary increases  the increasing rate of health care costs  and increased stock based compensation expense for stock option and restricted stock grants  primarily as a result of the increased amortization due to our adoption of sfas no 
in and the start of restricted stock grants to middle management in research and development expense we spent million on research and development in  representing a increase from million in  and a increase from million in the increases reflect higher employee related costs to support growth projects 
additionally  the increase from to also includes the impact of the consolidation of a joint venture in previously recorded as an equity method investment 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a decrease from million in the primary reason for the decrease in was the retirement at the end of march of million of us debt  due july  interest expense for was million  which was higher than million in  primarily due to higher short term us interest rates and a reduction in capitalized interest from prior years due to lower capital spending in each year 
amortization of finite lived intangible assets amortization of intangible assets for was million  a decrease from million in  and a decrease from million in the decrease is due to a lower asset base as compared to prior years  resulting primarily from the and impairments of certain finite lived intangible assets 
share of affiliate earnings  net in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  a increase from million in the increase was primarily due to increased earnings from an equity affiliate in our electronic materials segment offset by decreased earnings from affiliates in the coatings and adhesives and sealants segments 
in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  a decrease from million in the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which required the consolidation of a joint venture in that was previously accounted for as an equity affiliate 
restructuring and asset impairments severance and employee benefits for the year ended december   our management approved restructuring initiatives to further improve the efficiency of our manufacturing network and support organization across several of our business segments 
the restructuring initiatives involve the closing or partial shutdown of manufacturing facilities in north america  the united kingdom and germany  in addition to a north american research and development facility 
included in the net million restructuring expense for are provisions for severance and employee benefits of million for employees company wide  impacting virtually all areas including sales and marketing  manufacturing  administrative support and research personnel 
included in the restructuring charge were provisions for contract and lease terminations totaling million 
offsetting the charge were favorable adjustments of million to reduce prior years restructuring reserves  primarily related to severance and employee benefits due to fewer employee separations than originally anticipated as some employees were re deployed and others filled positions left vacant through natural attrition 
the cost savings initiatives are expected to yield pre tax savings of approximately million annually 
for the year ended december   our management approved restructuring initiatives related to the reorganization of our plastics additives and architectural and functional coatings businesses and adhesives and sealants and electronic materials segments in north america and europe  which resulted in million of new restructuring charges and affected positions in total 
offsetting the charge were favorable adjustments of million to reduce prior year restructuring reserves 
included in the restructuring charge were provisions for contract and lease terminations totaling million 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recognized a net million of severance and associated employee benefit expense  of which million  affecting  positions in total  pertained to initiatives 
the initiatives included a european restructuring initiative across many of our chemical businesses  a north american support services initiative  and several smaller reduction in force initiatives 
these initiatives were designed to address business and infrastructure inefficiencies  reduce redundant costs and reposition our workforce to capitalize on the enhancements made possible by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
included in the charges were unfavorable adjustments of million to prior year restructuring reserves 
the changes to prior year initiatives primarily include settlement losses on pension obligations as individual pension liabilities were settled from the pension plan 
we recognize pension settlement gains or losses at the time an employee s individual liability is settled within the pension plan 
asset impairments for the year ended december   million of asset impairments charges were recognized for the impairment of certain finite lived intangible and fixed assets across several of our chemical businesses and our electronic materials segment 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total asset impairment charge by million 
of the total impairment charge  million pertained to the impairment of fixed assets  while million was an impairment charge recorded for certain finite lived intangible assets to adjust their carrying value to their fair value 
for the year ended december   we recorded asset impairment charges of million which was primarily related to an administrative functions initiative 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of net asset impairment charges 
of the total  million was recognized as asset impairment charges recorded to adjust the carrying value of certain finite lived intangible assets and net fixed assets to their fair value  which was calculated using discounted cash flow analyses 
gains on sales of previously impaired assets offset the total impairment charge by million 
other income  net in  net other income increased to million from million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million from lower currency losses  and million of higher interest income due to higher short term interest rates and increased average investments in money market funds 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in gains on disposal of real estate 
in  net other income increased to million from million in significant increases in other income includes million of pre tax gains on sales of real estate and an million pre tax gain on the sale of our remaining interest in the european salt business  as noted above 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million for the year ended december  reflecting an effective tax rate from continuing operations before minority interest of compared to the effective rate for earnings in during the second quarter  we recorded net tax reserve and valuation allowance reversals resulting from the favorable resolution of prior period tax contingencies due to the completion of prior years tax audits 
in addition  we recorded changes in valuation allowances and increases in tax reserves for other contingencies 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the changes described above which total a net million as well as lower taxes on foreign earnings resulting from the increase in foreign tax credits and the permanent reinvestment outside the us of foreign earnings  upon which no us tax has been provided 
in  we recorded a provision for income tax expense of million reflecting an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective rate from on earnings in is primarily due to lower taxes on foreign earnings 

table of contents minority interest in the year ended december   we reported minority interest of million  as compared to million in and an immaterial amount reported in the majority of our minority interest relates to a consolidated joint venture recorded in our electronic materials segment 
earnings from continuing operations in the year ended december   we reported earnings from continuing operations of million or per share  as compared to prior period earnings from continuing operations of million or per share 
the growth in earnings was primarily due to increased gross profit driven by higher selling prices  needed to offset higher raw material  operating and energy costs  as well as favorable currencies and product mix 
the increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher restructuring charges  as well as the loss due to an early extinguishment of debt 
earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to million in the growth in earnings was primarily due to the absence of prior period restructuring and asset impairment charges of million after tax  increased gross profit driven by higher sales  partially offset by higher selling  administrative and research expenses 
cumulative effect of accounting change the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  was a required change in accounting principle and the cumulative effect of adopting this standard as of january  resulted in a non cash  after tax charge of million in the first quarter of as a result of the adoption of fin r consolidation of variable interest entities  we consolidated a joint venture as of january  due to the fact that we previously accounted for this joint venture as an equity method investment  the cumulative effect of the accounting change was not material 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december  through december  by business segment coatings in  net sales from our coatings segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in the sales improvement was primarily driven by higher selling prices  with the favorable impact of currencies offset by lower demand 
sales from architectural and functional coatings  which account for the majority of total coatings sales  increased over the prior year  driven primarily by higher selling prices  a more favorable product mix  and favorable currencies  on flat demand 
strength in the north american decorative coatings market was offset by weakness in the european markets along with share losses globally in paper and graphic arts 
powder coatings sales decreased  primarily due to lower demand in europe  the result of softness in the marketplace and share loss 
demand for powder coatings in north america was down from the prior period reflecting the ongoing move of downstream customers to the asia pacific region 
the business recently opened a new plant in shanghai  china to take advantage of this rapidly growing market 
this lower demand was only partially offset by improved pricing  the favorable impact of currency  and modest growth in asia 
automotive coatings sales decreased by from the prior year period  primarily due to decreased demand related to lower automotive builds by us producers  partially offset by share gains  price increases  and the favorable impact of currency 
earnings from continuing operations were million in versus prior year earnings of million 
results include million  after tax  in restructuring and asset impairment charges  primarily in the powder coatings business  compared to million  after tax  in restructuring charges in the prior year period 
higher selling prices  a more favorable product mix  and the favorable impact of currencies were substantially offset by higher raw material  manufacturing and energy costs  higher selling  administrative and research costs  and lower demand  as well as restructuring charges in the powder coatings business 
in  net sales from our coatings segment were  million  an increase of  or million  from net sales of  million in in  our coatings segment realized benefits driven primarily by higher demand  especially in the architectural and functional coatings business  the favorable impact of currencies  and higher selling prices 
sales from architectural and functional coatings  which account for the majority of total coatings sales  increased over the prior year due primarily to strong demand and increased selling prices and  to a lesser extent  the favorable impact of currencies 
this increase in demand was attributable to strong building and construction markets as well as steady growth from new products  such as our latest opaque polymers and semi gloss binders 
the increase in demand in asia pacific was across most markets 
powder coatings sales increased due to the favorable impact of currencies and a slight increase in selling prices offset by lower demand  especially in the european region

higher demand for non ice control products  especially for water conditioning and industrial markets  largely offset the decreased ice control sales as compared with the very strong prior year 
earnings from continuing operations were million for compared to million from reflecting increased energy and employee related costs  promotional expenses for new products and higher distribution costs 
adhesives and sealants in  net sales for adhesives and sealants were million  an increase of or million from net sales of million in the increase reflects the impacts of higher pricing and favorable currencies  partially offset by lower demand 
the overall lower demand was largely the result of planned portfolio adjustments as we shed low margin business earlier in  along with the impact of our current pricing strategy 

table of contents earnings of million in decreased by million versus the million earned in the earnings decline is largely the result of million  after tax  in non cash asset impairment charges recorded in the second and third quarters of as well as million  after tax  in charges in the fourth quarter related to realignment of manufacturing operations in europe 
these charges tempered the business ongoing improvements in operating performance resulting from pricing to recover raw material and energy cost increases  effective portfolio management initiatives  as well as a more efficient cost structure

corporate for the year ended december   corporate after tax expenses were million  down from million in the change was primarily driven by an adjustment to tax reserves and tax valuation allowances in conjunction with tax audit settlements  reduced restructuring and shared service expenses  higher interest income  and lower interest expense all of which more than offset the costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt  an adjustment to stock based compensation  higher environmental remediation accruals  the absence of gains on the sale of the remaining interest in our european salt business  and lower insurance recoveries 
corporate reported after tax expenses of million in  representing a increase over prior year after tax expenses of million 
insurance recoveries were lower by million after tax 
the remaining increase was primarily due to higher consulting costs for internal control documentation as part of our efforts to comply with rules under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as higher environmental spending 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview one of our key financial policies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with debt levels well covered by our cash flows 
as of december   our company s debt ratio total debt in proportion to total debt plus stockholders equity was  down from as of december   and cash from operating activities exceeded of our year end debt 
over the next several years  we expect to pursue growth strategies and provide cash returns to our stockholders without unduly stressing these ratios 
we intend to generate stockholder value through higher dividends  strategic investments in our core businesses and technologies  and stock repurchases as appropriate  specifically to continue to pay higher cash dividends to our stockholders 
dividend payouts have increased at an average compound annual growth rate since reinvest in core businesses through our capital expenditure program to drive profitable growth and enhance stockholder value 
we may also consider selected acquisitions or alliances in targeted areas 
repurchase our common stock 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
in  we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
in the year ended december   our primary source of cash was from operating activities 
our principal uses of cash were reduction of debt  capital expenditures  dividends and stock repurchases 
these are summarized in the table below year ended december  in millions cash provided by operations net long term debt reduction issuance capital expenditures dividends stock repurchases stock option exercise proceeds cash provided by operations for the year ended december   cash provided by operations exceeded the prior year by primarily due to higher earnings and non cash charges  partially offset by voluntary funding of our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans and premium paid on debt retirement 
non cash charges during included higher restructuring charges and increased stock based compensation cost 
increased working capital in the monomers business  which included higher customer receivables on higher sales and strategic year end inventory increases  was offset by an increase in federal and foreign taxes payable due to increased earnings 
more than two thirds of cash provided by operations was generated during the second half of the year 
this is typical of our seasonality with cash from operating activities concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to working capital patterns in some of our core businesses  such as coatings and salt  as well as the timing of certain annual payments such as employee bonuses  interest on debt and property taxes  which have been concentrated in the first half of the year 
maintaining strong operating cash flow through earnings and working capital management continues to be an important objective 
pension plan and postretirement benefit plan funding and liability our us erisa qualified pension plans represent approximately of our pension plan assets 
during  we identified an opportunity to increase the funding of our us pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans on a tax deductible basis 
accordingly  we decided to maximize tax deductible funding of these plans by voluntarily 
table of contents contributing million to our us pension trust in october of this total  million was designated to fund pension benefits and the remaining million to fund retiree health care 
we also increased funding of our smaller international pension trusts 
total funding for international plans was approximately million in  over half of which was used to fund shortfalls in our united kingdom pension trust 
in  we contributed a total of approximately million to our qualified and non qualified pension plans as well as our postretirement healthcare plans 
we do not expect to make contributions to our us pension trust during we do expect to contribute to the non us plans in funding requirements for subsequent years are uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in assumptions used to calculate plan funding levels  the actual return on plan assets  changes in the employee groups covered by the plan  and any legislative or regulatory changes affecting plan funding requirements 
for tax planning  financial planning  cash flow management or cost reduction purposes  the company may increase  accelerate  decrease or delay contributions to the plan to the extent permitted by law 
the overall unfunded status of the pension plans remained largely unchanged during as the us unfunded level  which increased from to million  was largely offset by an improvement in the unfunded status of the non us plans from to million 
the decline in the non us unfunded level was driven by an increase in our us pension benefit obligation 
the non us funding improved as higher investment returns and contributions offset the impact of a higher pension benefit obligation caused by the decrease in discount rates 
our global pension benefit obligation increased by million in largely driven by three major factors 
these included lower discount rates used to calculate the net present value of plan liabilities  the adoption of the mortality table within the us plan and unfavorable demographic shifts largely within the us plan 
these changes were partially offset by the strengthening of the dollar used in the conversion of non us liabilities 
the fair value of assets increased by million during largely due to the increase in asset base resulting from the significant contribution made to the us plans and the increase in contributions made to us plans 
this increase in fair value is also attributable to the strong investment performance of the non us plans  offset by the unfavorable impact of currency on converting non us plan assets 
qualified pension expense increased to million in from million in and million in as the result of lower expected returns from lower assets and recognition of actuarial losses  especially in the us during  the plans total unrecognized net loss increased by million  primarily due to lower discount rates for both the u 
s and non us plans  and the adoption of the mortality table for the us plans 
actual returns on plan assets were higher than assumed returns  which decreased the total unrecognized net loss by million 
because the total unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds the greater of of the projected benefit obligation or of the plan assets  the excess will be amortized over the average expected future working lifetime of active plan participants 
as of january   the average expected future working lifetime of active plan participants varies by plan and ranges from to years 
actual results for will depend on the actuarial valuation of the plan 

table of contents capital expenditures we manage our capital expenditures to take advantage of growth and productivity improvement opportunities as well as to fund ongoing environmental protection and plant infrastructure requirements 
we have a well defined review procedure for the authorization of capital projects 
capital expenditures in were approximately the same as prior year expenditures 
significant capital additions include construction of a new research and development center in shanghai  china which will be completed in  capacity initiatives within the north american emulsion manufacturing locations  process control systems at our knoxville  tn facility  and volatile organic compound reduction and quality capacity improvements at our chauny  france facility 
process control systems at our knoxville  tn and lauterbourg  france plants  security systems in many of our north american region plants  powder coatings facility in china  and purchase of bulk shipping terminal assets at our bristol  pa and lamirada  ca sites 
expansions in our houston  tx and villers saint paul  france plants for the monomers and consumer and industrial specialties businesses  respectively  equipment purchases for our electronic materials segment  and completion of our mumbai  india plant 
expenditures for the past three years  categorized by primary purpose of project  are presented below in millions cost savings and infrastructure capacity additions and new products erp infrastructure research facilities and equipment capitalized interest cost total spending for environmental protection equipment included in several of the categories in the table shown above  was million in  million in and million in projected capital expenditures in of approximately million are expected to be in line with depreciation expense 

table of contents dividends common stock dividends have been paid each year since the payout has increased at an average compound annual growth rate since dividend paid amount per common in year share millions line graph stock repurchase program in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
during  we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
restricted cash in  we invested million in cash equivalents  considered restricted cash 
restricted cash represents investments in cash equivalents through a trust designed to meet financial assurance requirements of us federal  state and local environmental agencies with respect to plant operations 
these requirements are based on an annual assessment of our company s net worth 
because we have met the specified requirements  most authorities have released the restrictions and approximately million remained at december   down from million at december  other cash flow information included in cash from investing activities in is million in proceeds to settle foreign exchange forward and currency collar contracts used to hedge our investments in euro and yen based operating units 
in contrast  in  cash from investing activities included million in expenditures to settle foreign exchange forward and currency collar contracts used to hedge our investments in euro and yen based operating units 
included in cash provided by financing activities is million and million in and  respectively  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
additional information regarding our hedging activities is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and debt as of december   we had million in cash  including restricted cash  and  million in debt compared with million and  million  respectively  at december  a summary of our cash and debt balances is provided below december  december  in millions short term obligations long term debt total debt cash and cash equivalents restricted cash total debt in march of  we retired million of our notes scheduled to mature on july  the retirement resulted in a loss of million 
we had entered into interest rate locks prior to original issuance of this debt in  fixed floating interest rate swap contracts in may which had been cashed out in may  and interest rate locks again during the first quarter of in conjunction with the retirement 
cumulative cash received from these derivatives reduced the loss which would have otherwise been incurred by million 
our interest expense decreased by approximately million through year end  and we expect to report lower interest expense of approximately million per quarter through july due to the debt retirement 
this early retirement was enabled by the strong cash flow from prior year operations 
in july  we issued billion of japanese yen denominated variable rate notes million at december  due in july the interest rate is set semi annually in january and july at the six month tokyo interbank offered rate tibor plus 
interest is paid semi annually in january and july 
on september   we completed an exchange offer to existing holders of our million euro denominated notes due march  as a result of the exchange offer  million of the euro notes  were exchanged for million euro denominated notes due september  the remaining million of euro notes are still outstanding and continue to be due march  the exchange of notes was accounted for as a modification of debt with no gain or loss recognized 
costs of approximately million associated with the exchange were expensed during the third quarter 
the euro notes will initially be recorded at million million at december  a discount of million and subject to accretion up to the million principal value over the time through maturity 
the primary objective of the exchange was to extend the maturity of the original debt for years at an attractive interest rate 
it also has the effect of lowering our annual interest expense by approximately million through the original maturity  march  our multi year program to reduce debt has now largely been completed 
at december   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
the remainder of our short term debt was primarily composed of local bank borrowings 
during  our primary source of short term liquidity will be cash from operating activities 
this will be supplemented with commercial paper and bank borrowings to support local working capital needs from time to time 
in december  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with a syndicated group of banks 
this facility is committed until december and is not contingent upon our credit rating 
as of december   we have not had any drawndown funds against this facility 
moody s and standard and poor s currently rate our senior unsecured long term debt a and bbb  respectively  with stable and positive outlooks  respectively  and our short term commercial paper  p and a  respectively 
in general  we believe single a ratings are consistent with the objectives of our long term financial policies 

table of contents use of derivative instruments to manage market risk we use derivative instruments to reduce volatility arising from conducting our business in a variety of currencies  financing at long and short term interest rates and pricing our raw materials at market prices 
during the year ended december   million net cash and million in earnings were realized from derivative instruments 
as of december   the fair market value of all derivative contracts was a net million after tax asset compared with a net million after tax liability at december  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table provides contractual obligations and commitments for future payments in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total within year years years over years long term debt  including current portion interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations  pension and other employee benefit funding esop loan guarantees interest on esop loan guarantees total contractual cash obligations notes in march  we retired million of our notes for cash 
we expect this will reduce our interest expense by approximately million a year though july  for our requirements contracts  we have assumed that our existing business segments will require materials and services generally consistent with prior years 
the amount of the obligation is based upon either projected requirements or historical spend 
our purchase obligations include raw materials  indirect materials  traffic and logistics  utilities and energy  information technology and communications contracts 
evergreen contracts are contracts that renew automatically until specifically cancelled by either party 
we have assumed that our evergreen contracts will continue through forecasting qualified pension plan contributions requires the usage of certain assumptions such as interest rates used to calculate plan liabilities  demographic assumptions used to determine changes in participation and rates of return on assets  therefore  we feel it is appropriate to only forecast out years due to the uncertainties of the future assumptions 
the non qualified plan and other employee benefits reflect expected future benefit payments  which are forecasted out through see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock through  with the timing of the purchases depending on market conditions and other priorities for cash 
during  we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
trading activities we do not have any trading activity that involves non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
unconsolidated entities all significant entities are consolidated 
any unconsolidated entities are de minimis in nature and there are no significant contractual requirements to fund losses of unconsolidated entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our treatment of variable interest entities 
environmental matters and litigation our chemical operations  as those of other chemical manufacturers  involve the use and disposal of substances regulated under environmental protection laws 
our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the risk of harm to the environment 
the company has participated in the remediation of waste disposal and manufacturing sites as required under the superfund and related laws 
remediation is well underway or has been completed at many sites 
nevertheless  the 
table of contents company continues to face government enforcement actions  as well as private actions  related to past manufacturing and disposal and continues to focus on achieving cost effective remediation where required 
accruals we have provided for costs to remediate former manufacturing and waste disposal sites  including superfund sites  as well as our company facilities 
we consider a broad range of information when we determine the amount necessary for remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for these or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other potentially responsible parties prps to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
reserves for environmental remediation that we believe to be probable and estimable are recorded appropriately as current and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the accruals quarterly and update as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  we are unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of our responsibility for study and remediation costs 
the amounts charged to pre tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are included in cost of goods sold and are presented below in millions balance december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  amounts charged to earnings spending december  wood ridge berry s creek the wood ridge  new jersey  site site  and berry s creek  which runs past this site  are areas of environmental significance to the company 
the site is the location of a former mercury processing plant acquired many years ago by a company later acquired by morton international  inc morton 
morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation of the site 
as of the date we acquired morton  morton disclosed and accrued for certain ongoing studies related to the site 
in our allocation of the purchase price of morton  we accrued for additional study costs and additional remediation costs based on the ongoing studies 
we have submitted a feasibility study of various remedial alternatives  and we expect new jersey department of environmental protection  in consultation with epa region  to select a remedy for the site in our exposure at the site will depend  in part  on the results of attempts to obtain contributions from others believed to share responsibility  and  in part  on the remedy selected for the site 
velsicol s liabilities for site response costs will be addressed through a bankruptcy trust fund established under a court approved settlement among velsicol  fruit of the loom  inc its indemnitor and other parties  including the government 
with regard to berry s creek  and the surrounding wetlands  we understand that the epa intends to finalize a study framework document  calling for a broad scope investigation of risks posed by contamination in berry s creek  and to require a large group of prps to perform this study 
performance of this study is expected to take at least six years to complete 
today  there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek  but investigation and cleanup costs  as well as potential resource damage assessments  could be very high and our share of these costs could possibly be material to the results of our operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
our other significant environmental matters are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to accrued environmental liabilities  there are costs which have not met the definition of probable  and accordingly  are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have identified reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 

table of contents other environmental expenditures the laws and regulations under which we operate require significant expenditures for capital improvements  operation of environmental protection equipment  environmental compliance and remediation 
our major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make unforeseen additional environmental expenditures 
capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
spending for and is expected to approximate million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental aspects of projects in other categories that are intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
the cost of managing  operating and maintaining current pollution abatement facilities was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was charged against current year earnings 
climate change there is an increasing global focus on issues related to climate change and particularly on ways to limit and control the emission of greenhouse gases  which are believed to be associated with climate change 
some initiatives on these topics are already well along in europe  canada and other countries and related legislation has been introduced  but not passed  in the us the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change was adopted in in many countries 
for instance  the european union has a mandatory emissions trading scheme to implement its objectives under the kyoto protocol 
four of our european locations currently exceed the threshold for participation in the eu emissions trading scheme pursuant to the kyoto protocol and are currently implementing the requirements established by their respective countries 
we are very much aware of the importance of these issues and the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions 
due to the nature of our business  we have emissions of co from combustion sources  but our emissions of other greenhouse gases no  hfcs  etc 
are minimal as compared to co emissions 
we have therefore focused on ways to increase energy efficiency and curb potential increases in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from growth in production in addition to lowering the energy usage of existing operations 
although the general lack of specific legislation prevents any accurate estimates of the long term impact on the company  any legislation that limits co emissions may create a potential restriction to business growth by capping consumption of traditional energy sources available to all consumers of energy  including rohm and haas 
the outcomes of capping consumption could include increased energy cost  additional capital investment to lower energy intensity and rationed usage with the need to purchase greenhouse gas emission credits 
we will continue to follow these climate change issues  work to improve the energy efficiencies of our operations  work to minimize any negative impacts on company operations and seek technological breakthroughs in energy supply and efficiency 
litigation we are involved in various kinds of litigation  principally in the united states 
we strive to resolve litigation where we can through negotiation and other alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation 
otherwise  we vigorously defend lawsuits in the courts 
significant litigation is described in note to the consolidated financial statements  but we will comment here on several recent legal matters 
on january  and thereafter  civil lawsuits were filed against rohm and haas and other chemical companies in federal court  alleging violation of antitrust laws in the production and sale of methyl methacrylate mma 
the plaintiffs seek to represent a class of purchasers of mma in the united states from january  through december  the lawsuits refer to an investigation of certain mma producers by the european commission in which rohm and haas was not involved in any way 
the company believes these lawsuits are without merit as to rohm and haas  and intends to defend them vigorously 

table of contents in late january  morton salt was served with a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the department of justice into possible antitrust law violations in the industrial salt business 
neither morton salt  nor any morton salt employee has been charged with any wrongdoing 
the company is cooperating fully with the governmental investigation 
on december   a federal judge in indiana issued a decision purporting to grant a class of participants in the rohm and haas pension plan the right to a cost of living adjustment cola as part of the retirement benefit for those who elect a lump sum benefit 
the decision contravenes the plain language of the plan  which clearly and expressly excludes a discretionary cola for participants who elect a lump sum 
we feel strongly that our plan fully complies with applicable law and therefore the judge s decision is contrary to law 
we are seeking an immediate appeal to the seventh circuit court of appeals 
were the decision to stand  the pension trust could be required to pay a cola benefit to those plan participants who elected a lump sum benefit during the class period 
we are still evaluating the extent of the potential financial impact of such a result on the plan 
acquisitions and divestitures significant acquisitions and divestitures are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
working capital in  we continued to focus on improving our working capital management 
as compared to  days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in ending inventory both improved by days 
details about two major components of working capital at the end of and are summarized below dollars in millions inventories year end balance annual turnover x x days cost of sales in ending inventory customer receivables year end balance annual turnover x x days sales outstanding notes for customer receivables  annual turnover figures are calculated by dividing annual sales by the average customer receivables balance 
for inventories  annual turnover figures are calculated by dividing cost of goods sold by the average inventory balance 
days sales outstanding were calculated by dividing ending net customer receivables by daily sales for the fourth quarter 
days cost of sales in ending inventory was calculated by dividing ending inventory by daily cost of sales for the fourth quarter 
asset turnover equals sales divided by average year end assets 
asset turnover was x in and x in both and

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since we denominate our business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finance our operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchase raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
our operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments for which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting the amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all derivative contracts was million pre tax that is carried as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
all of these contracts were with investment grade financial institutions 
we enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analyses quantify the impact of potential changes in these rates and prices on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during the forecast period  most commonly within a one year period 
the ranges of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over the forecast period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 
foreign exchange rate risk our products are manufactured and sold in a number of locations around the world 
we generate revenues and incur costs in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  we finance operations outside of the united states in local currencies 
our diverse base of local currency costs  financings  and foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts will partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on revenues  earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
nevertheless  when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
known and anticipated exposures are covered by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
most significant foreign currency exposures are related to our operations in germany  france  italy  the netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden  switzerland  brazil  mexico  canada  japan  taiwan  china and australia 
we estimate that an instantaneous depreciation in all the currencies of these countries from their levels against the dollar as of december   with all other variables held constant  would increase the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  by million  a appreciation of these currencies would decrease the fair market value by million 
this estimate is based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of short and long term debt by million  net of derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on our earnings per share or cash flows as the majority of our debt obligations at december  consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of the weighted average rate on our worldwide debt 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material and energy prices have had material impacts on our earnings and cash flows in the past  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
commodity derivative instruments are used to reduce portions of commodity price risks 
a increase in the underlying commodity price would increase the fair value of commodity derivative instruments by million 
a decrease in the underlying commodity price would decrease the fair value of commodity derivative instruments by million
