item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation all percentage amounts and ratios were calculated using the underlying data in thousands 
operating results for the year ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for future fiscal years 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
overview we have been a public company for six years  and have built upon our broad technology platform to establish ourselves as a profitable company with several complementary operating business areas 
since our initial public offering in  our revenue has increased at a compounded average annual rate of  and we have been profitable since the first quarter of since our inception  we have invested heavily in establishing the technology  instrumentation  and software necessary to transform traditional research and development and pursue high throughput discovery of materials 
through our research collaborations and our own internal research  we continue to develop high throughput technologies for discovery of new materials 
we apply our expertise in high throughput research technologies to offer an expanding line of symyx tools 
symyx software continues to expand  offering our customers integrated data management capabilities and enterprise wide access to research information 
our list of discovered materials continues to advance  including catalysts to manufacture commodity chemicals and polyolefins  polymers and phosphors for life science and industrial applications  and specialized materials for electronics applications 
we believe we are now well positioned to capitalize on these investments 
recent developments our major recent developments and their impact on our business are highlighted below new symyx tools during  we enabled further modularization of our symyx tools systems with the introduction of our extended core module xcm  an update to our core x module that we offered in our xcm provides the base building block for symyx tools systems 
it can be configured and expanded to fit customers requirements and can be modified as system requirements change by removing one module and inserting another 
built upon our new xcm  during the year  we also introduced the forced degradation fd system to the pharmaceutical industry  for testing pharmaceutical ingredients in a variety of extreme chemical and environmental conditions 
our new fd system offers significant improvement in throughput compared to current  manual practices 
integration of symyx software offering in november  we acquired intellichem  inc and in april  we completed the acquisition of synthematix  inc during  we completed the integration of our symyx software operations  incorporating product features of lab automation  electronic lab notebook and data mining software applications 
we realigned our sales force  which doubled to approximately  as a result of acquisitions 
our sales force is now organized by industry focus  and we added offices in new jersey  switzerland and japan 
co investing to develop new applications for our high throughput technologies we are co investing in research programs with smaller companies  often venture backed  to pursue opportunities in new fields 
these research and development partnerships combine our partner s domain knowledge and relationships with our expertise in high throughput research technologies 
we are working with intermolecular  inc in the field of integrated circuits  with an undisclosed company in photovoltaics  and with stargate mobile to introduce oil condition sensors in the field of commercial vehicles 
in the year ended december   we generated total revenue of million  with operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per share of 
included in the operating income and net income were purchase accounting adjustments and other special charges arising from the acquisitions of intellichem and synthematix  including approximately million of an in process research and development charge  million of amortization of intangible assets  and other merger related expenses 
during  we generated positive cash flow from operations and ended the year with million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities after paying a net million to acquire synthematix 
our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to employees at the end of and to employees at the end of primarily as the result of intellichem and synthematix acquisitions  the expansion of our software group and additional research personnel to meet our contractual obligation under our alliance agreements with exxonmobil and dow 
we anticipate that our headcount will continue to increase to meet the mix and level of staffing required by our collaborative  tools and software agreements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this annual report on form k  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
preparing financial statements and related disclosures requires management to exercise judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  revenue recognition  establishing the warranty expense accrual  establishing slow moving  obsolete and excess inventory reserves  determining when technical feasibility for our software products has been achieved  and determining the useful life of intangible assets 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are impacted significantly by judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  the emerging issues task force consensus on issue or eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and other authoritative accounting literature 
we generate revenue from services provided under research collaborations  the sale of products  license of software  provision of support and maintenance services  and the license of intellectual property 
it is possible for our customers to work with us in multiple areas of our business and contracts may include multiple elements of service revenue  product revenue  and license and royalty revenue 
in determining the basis for revenue recognition  we first determine the fair value of any extended warranty services and defer this revenue to be recognized over the service period 
for those contracts that involve multiple element deliverables  we identify all deliverables and allocate revenue between the units of accounting in accordance with eitf in an arrangement that includes software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole  we recognize revenue from the software and software related elements  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality  in accordance with sop service revenue consists of research and development funding received from collaborative partners as well as support and maintenance or extended warranty agreements 
product revenue consists of payments from customers for symyx tools systems  comprising hardware  associated software and intellectual property licenses and consumables 
royalties and license fees include fees for licensing of our software  intellectual property  proprietary materials and technology license payments and royalties on laboratory instruments and software sold under license by third parties 
service revenue we recognize revenue from research collaboration agreements  software consulting  and support and maintenance agreements as earned upon performance of the services specified in the agreements 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk until the milestones are completed  is recognized upon completion of these milestone events 
milestone payments to date have been immaterial 
revenue allocable to support and maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the support and maintenance is provided 
our product related software licenses may provide for technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis for periods defined within the contract 
revenue related to this post contract customer support is deferred and recognized over the term of the contracted support 
product sales we recognize revenue from the sale of symyx tools hardware and the license of associated software  and all related costs of products sold are expensed  once delivery has occurred and customer acceptance has been achieved 
a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance 
a determination is made for each system delivered as to whether software is incidental to the system as a whole 
if software is not incidental to the symyx tools system as a whole  revenue from these arrangements is recognized in accordance with sop  as amended 
if software is incidental to the symyx tools system  revenue from the sale of the symyx tools system is earned and recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize product revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual method to allocate revenue to delivered elements once it has established fair value for all undelivered elements 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
software license fees for software licensed on an annual right to use basis  revenue is recognized straight line over the term of the license 
for revenue allocable to the software portion of a multiple element arrangement or licensed on a perpetual basis  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software product to the end user and commencement of the license  unless we have ongoing obligations for which fair value cannot be established or the fee is not fixed or determinable or collectibility is not reasonably assured  in which case we recognize revenue only when each of these criteria have been met 
by way of example  for the eln software products that we acquired from intellichem  inc and synthematix  inc  we have not yet established the fair value of all the ongoing obligations and accordingly  any perpetual license fees are recognized ratably over the period of the ongoing obligations typically a bundled support and maintenance commitment of one year 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
intellectual property license fees and royalties we recognize license fee revenue for licenses to our intellectual property when earned under the terms of the agreements 
generally  revenue is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established  in which case the revenue is recognized over the period of the obligation 
if there are extended payment terms  we recognize license fee revenue as these payments become due 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months not to be fixed or determinable 
in certain licensing arrangements there is provision for a variable fee as well as a non refundable minimum amount 
in such arrangements  the amount of the non refundable minimum guarantee is recognized upon transfer of the license unless we have continuing obligations for which fair value cannot be established and the amount of the variable fee in excess of the guaranteed minimum is recognized as revenue when it is fixed and determinable 
we recognize royalty revenue based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
if there are extended payment terms  royalty revenue is recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
warranty expense accrual a warranty expense accrual is established at the time of customer acceptance of a symyx tool system and is included as a cost of product sold 
management is required to exercise judgment in establishing the appropriate level of warranty expense accrual for each symyx tool system delivered and establishes the accrual based  in part  on reference to actual warranty costs incurred on similar systems 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material impact on our financial statements 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our original estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
in years  and  we have recorded favorable adjustments of approximately   and  respectively 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  we expense our software development costs when incurred 
inventories we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a specific identification basis 
we apply judgment in determining the provisions for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience and anticipated product demand 
intangible assets we amortize intangible assets over their estimated economic lives 
determining the estimated economic life of intangible assets requires judgment on the part of management 
for example  if we determined that the estimated economic lives of these assets were one year less than those reported in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the amortization expense of intangibles would have been increased by million 
we conduct impairment reviews of intangible assets annually or when circumstances indicate the potential impairment of intangible assets 
we also review the amortization periods for intangible assets when circumstances indicate there may be a change in economic lives of intangible assets 
employee stock options we generally grant stock options to our employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares on the date of grant 
as allowed under the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for stock awards to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements prior to january  in connection with stock options granted to employees with exercise prices not less than fair value 
deferred compensation for options assumed in connection with business combinations is determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of our common stock on the date options were assumed 
deferred compensation is being amortized on a graded vesting method 
had we elected to expense stock options based on their fair value in accordance with sfas  we would have reported a net loss of approximately million   and million for  and  respectively 
business acquisitions acquisition of intellichem  inc on november   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of intellichem  a provider of intelligent electronic lab notebooks for customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and chemical industries 
the results of intellichem s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
the total purchase price for this acquisition was million  consisting of approximately million in cash  million in fair value of assumed stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock  and million in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
the intrinsic value of these options  totaling approximately million  has been recorded as deferred stock compensation 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we allocated the purchase price to the tangible assets  deferred compensation  liabilities  and intangible assets acquired  as well as in process research and development  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to our software segment 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the purchase price allocation was as follows in thousands amount fair value of net assets purchased deferred tax assets in process research and development trade name developed technology customer relationships unearned stock compensation deferred tax liabilities release of valuation allowance against acquirer s deferred income tax assets upon recognition of deferred income tax liabilities on acquired identifiable intangible assets in connection with acquisition of intellichem goodwill total the allocation of the consideration for the acquisition of intellichem to its individual assets and liabilities was based on management s analysis and estimates of the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities 
in addition to the value assigned to in process research and development ipr d projects  and intellichem s tangible assets  specific intangible assets were identified and valued 
the identifiable intangible assets included customer relationships  a trade name  and developed technology 
the ipr d project that intellichem has been working on was the development of next generation of intellichem software 
that software had not yet been proven to be technologically feasible but had been developed to a point where it had value associated with potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing date of the acquisition  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the value of ipr d was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
a discount rate of was used which is higher than intellichem s computed weighted average cost of capital of due to inherent risk surrounding the successful development of the ipr d and the increase in projected financial results compared with historical results 
this project has been completed in and costs associated with this project were not material and were included in the research and development expenses 
in performing this purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  our intention for future use of the acquired assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of intellichem s products 
the fair value of intangible assets was primarily based on the income approach 
the relief from royalty approach was also utilized when appropriate 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values ranged from to 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return and the weighted average return on assets 
risks we identified and considered in this analysis included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful completion of development efforts  market growth rates  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
at december   identifiable intangible assets purchased in the intellichem acquisition consisted of the following in thousands  except for useful life with a weighted average useful life of years 
no significant residual value was estimated for these assets 
amount useful life trade name year developed technology years customer relationships years balance at december   at cost acquisition of synthematix  inc on april   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding shares of privately held synthematix  inc  based in durham  north carolina 
synthematix was a provider of organic synthesis reaction planning software systems for scientific knowledge management in chemistry research  with customers primarily in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and fine chemical industries 
the results of synthematix s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
on august   synthematix was merged into one of our subsidiaries  symyx intellichem  inc  whose name was subsequently changed to symyx renaissance software  inc the preliminary purchase price for this acquisition was  consisting of approximately  in cash   in fair value of assumed stock options to purchase  shares of symyx common stock  and  in transaction costs  consisting of legal and other professional service fees 
according to the merger agreement  additional purchase consideration of up to  would be payable upon the achievement of certain revenue targets for products developed by the former synthematix 
based on the actual revenue generated by synthematix in  we did not record any additional purchase consideration as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  the company allocated the preliminary purchase price to the tangible assets  deferred compensation  liabilities  and intangible assets acquired  as well as in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair values was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
the acquired goodwill was assigned entirely to the company s software segment 
purchased intangibles with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives

no significant residual value is estimated for these assets 
amount useful life trade name year developed technology years customer relationships years balance at december   at cost years the ipr d project that synthematix was working on was the development of next generation of synthematix software 
at the date of acquisition  that software had not yet been proven to be technologically feasible but had been developed to a point where it had value associated with potential future revenue 
because technological feasibility was not proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition  in accordance with fasb interpretation no

the value of ipr d was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
a discount rate of was used for ipr d which is higher than the discount rate used to value other synthematix assets due to inherent risk surrounding the successful development of the ipr d and the increase in projected financial results compared with historical results 
results of operations revenue amount change over previous year amount change over previous year amount in s in s in s service revenue product sales license fees and royalties total revenue our total revenue increased from to and from to this increase was primarily due to the expansion of revenue under our alliance with the dow chemical company  as well as an increase in software license fees and royalties 
in  we commenced bifurcating symyx tools sales transactions into product sales revenue reported under the symyx tools segment and software license fees revenue the majority of which was reported under the symyx software segment 
prior to  symyx tools sales transactions were reported solely in the product sales revenue line in the consolidated income statements 
the impact to our consolidated income statement  if we reported our revenue from symyx tools sales transactions in the same way as we reported in periods prior to  would be an additional million of revenue reported in the product sales revenue line rather than in the license fees and royalties line 
with respect to segment reporting  we would have reported an additional million of revenue under the symyx tools segment rather than the symyx software segment 
revenue is attributed to the following geographic locations based on the physical location of symyx s customers as a percentage of total revenue in the respective periods north america japan belgium europe excluding belgium total less than in the last two years  we increased our market share in the european market primarily by selling our symyx tools to european customers 
we have also experienced an increase in our service revenue from the expansion of our research collaboration with an energy customer in europe 
we expect that we will continue to generate revenue from the european market through symyx tools sales  research collaboration service  license of our software  as well as license of our sensor technologies and intellectual property 
the following table lists our major customers for the years ended december   and and revenue generated from these customers as a percentage of our total revenue in the respective periods 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be generated from a few key customers 
exxonmobil merck the dow chemical company undisclosed partner total less than we segregate revenue by the following segments amount change over previous year amount change over previous year amount in s in s in s research collaborations symyx tools symyx software materials and ip licensing symyx sensors total the reconciliation of segment revenue above to the revenue disclosed in the consolidated income statements is provided in note segment disclosure of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
research collaborations revenue the research collaborations group generates revenue primarily from the research services it provides to our collaboration partners 
the increase in research collaborations revenue from to was primarily attributable to the funding received under the alliance agreement we entered into with exxonmobil effective april partially offset by a decrease in the level of funding received from an undisclosed partner 
in the dow alliance further accelerated the growth in research collaborations revenue 
we expect to receive over million in revenue from exxonmobil and over million in revenue from dow during the five year term of each of the alliances  through our research collaborations  product sales  and license of software and intellectual property 
through december   we had recognized million and million from exxonmobil and dow alliances  respectively  including total of approximately million in research collaborations revenue from these two alliances 
we believe these two alliances will continue to be the major contributors to our research collaborations revenue in through symyx tools revenue the symyx tools group generates revenue primarily from the sale of tools and associated software and intellectual property 
symyx tools revenue increased from million in to million in and million in for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales  million of service revenue  and  of license revenue 
for the year ended december   symyx tools revenue included million of product sales and million of service revenue 
the increase in symyx tools revenue in and was primarily due to increased shipments of symyx tools systems 
during years and  we shipped and tools systems  respectively  including our core x modules and extended core modules  to chemical  pharmaceutical  academic institutions  and several other customers 
we adopted our modular strategy in to facilitate timely customer purchases because purchase decisions on a complete symyx tools system may take a long time 
this modular approach allows our customers to build up full combinatorial high throughput experimentation capability over time by acquiring stand alone portions of a symyx tools system that integrate together to make an entire workflow 
under the exxonmobil and dow alliances  we are contracted to deliver multiple symyx tools systems in the next few years 
we also negotiate with other chemical and pharmaceutical companies for the sale of symyx tools systems 
we believe our expanding customer base will contribute to our expected growth of symyx tools revenue 
symyx software revenue the symyx software group generates revenue primarily from the licensing of software  including automation and data mining applications and eln software  and provision of associated support  maintenance and consulting services 
symyx software revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in symyx software revenue in was primarily due to the increased revenue from exxonmobil and pfizer for software licenses  and associated maintenance and support 
the increase in symyx software revenue in was due to increased revenue from software licenses and services provided to exxonmobil and dow as well as increased eln software licenses 
in the last quarter of  we entered into several license agreements with major pharmaceutical companies 
we expect symyx software revenue will continue to grow as we recognize the revenue for licenses and services under these agreements 
materials licensing and ip revenue the materials and ip licensing group generates revenue primarily from the licensing fees received from licensing our intellectual property and from royalties paid by third party licensees for sale of products containing our materials and intellectual property 
materials and ip licensing revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase in licensing revenue in over was primarily due to payments received from exxonmobil and uop 
the increase in licensing revenue in over was primarily due to payments received from dow 
we believe that the demonstrated acceptance of our high throughput experimentation technology by our customers will lead to the expected growth in our license fee revenue in future years 
we currently have three materials commercialized by dow  jsr corporation and agfa gevaert nv we anticipate that our customers may commercialize an additional four materials during we believe that these commercialized materials will contribute to our growth in intellectual property and materials licensing revenue in the future 
symyx sensors revenue the symyx sensors group offers development services and licenses for specific applications to our sensor technology 
symyx sensors revenue in both and consisted primarily of payments received from hella kg 
symyx sensors revenue increased significantly in over due primarily to payments received from univation for the sensor development  partially offset by the decrease in payments received from hella kg 
cost of products sold cost of products sold was million  or of product sales revenue in  compared to million  or of product sales revenue in and million  or of product sales revenue for the year ended december  the increase in the total cost of products sold in and was primarily due to the increase of products sold  along with changes in product mix 
the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales revenue in over was due to the change in the product mix shipped in the respective years  the bifurcation of symyx tools sales transactions into product sales revenue and software license fees revenue discussed under revenue above  as well as an unfavorable inventory obsolescence charge of approximately  in the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales revenue in over was due to a change in the product mix shipped in the respective years  the development costs related to prototypes delivered being expensed as discussed below  partially offset by a favorable adjustment of accrued warranty expense of approximately million 
the cost of products sold may be driven by the variability of product mix and sales volume in each period 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales is expected to fluctuate from period to period because the majority of symyx tools systems are built to order or to particular specifications 
for systems that include a significant development component prior to their commercial build  or systems delivered to customers as a prototype  the development costs incurred prior to the commercial build are expensed as development costs  which results in a lower cost of products sold and higher margin in the quarter in which such a system is delivered to the customer 
the cost of products sold may also be affected by adjustments to the warranty expense accrual for pre existing sales 
when actual warranty costs are lower than our estimates  the difference will have a favorable impact to cost of products sold at the time the warranty expires for the systems 
when actual warranty costs are anticipated to be higher than our original estimates  an additional expense is charged to cost of products sold in the period in which such a determination is made 
other operating expenses amount as a percentage of total revenue change over previous year amount as a percentage of total revenue change over previous year amount as a percentage of total revenue in s in s in s research and development sales  general and administrative acquired in process research and development n a amortization of intangible assets arising from business combinations n a total operating expenses less than research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  supplies  and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
the table below indicates the major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of collaborative research revenue in  for whom we conducted research and development  together with the date upon which the current contract ends and the primary focus of the collaborations 
contracts may only be extended by mutual agreement between us and the collaborative partner 
partner current research contract ends primary focus of current collaborative efforts bp including both bp and innovene 
innovene was spun off from bp at the end of catalysts for certain commodity chemicals exxonmobil catalysts for certain commodity chemicals including olefins the dow chemical company polyolefin catalysts for certain commodity chemicals we do not track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  based on hours spent on each project  we estimate the research and development efforts undertaken for various projects were as follows projects funded by collaboration partners internally funded research internal software development internal tools development total due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will achieve future milestones or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
research and development expenses in and included million and million  respectively  of direct costs of research services provided to ilypsa  a related party 
the increase of research and development expenses in and was due primarily to increases in salary related expenses due to the hiring of additional scientific and technical staff to work on research and development projects for exxonmobil and dow and increased headcount to develop our software platform 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased sequentially in and because the increase in research and development expenses lagged the significant increase in total revenue 
our core business areas are research to discover new materials  the sale of instruments and licensing of related software and licensing of intellectual property and materials discovered in our collaborative and internal research programs 
accordingly  we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for business development  legal  general management  finance  and human resources  as well as payments of commissions to our sales agents and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
the increase of sales  general and administrative expenses in and was primarily due to an increase of personnel costs  mainly as a result of adding a number of business development and sales staff to manage and support our growth  and an increase in auditing and tax related service fees  largely as a result of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  offset partially by the decrease in legal fees for intellectual property litigation 
although our sales  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in  and did not vary significantly  we expect that our sales  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we have expanded our business development and sales staff with the acquisitions of intellichem and synthematix and may continue to expand our personnel as a result of future acquisitions  continue to add to and improve our existing laboratory and engineering facilities  incur escalating costs related to being a public company  such as increasing professional fees  and are required to recognize stock based compensation expenses under sfas r starting january  acquired in process research and development in april  we acquired synthematix in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach 
at the date of the synthematix acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in the second quarter of additional discussion on acquired in process research and development can be found under business combination 
in november  we acquired intellichem in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach 
at the date of the intellichem acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the technology in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed in amortization of intangible assets arising from business combinations in connection with the acquisitions of intellichem in november and synthematix in april  we recorded million of intangible assets see notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
these intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
during the three months ended september   we advanced our branding strategy for our software offerings and accordingly the remaining useful life of the trade names acquired in the intellichem and synthematix acquisitions was reassessed to be months starting from september  for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and  respectively  of amortization of intangible assets expense related to these acquisitions 
in there was no amortization of intangible assets arising from business combinations 
interest and other income interest and other income for the years ended december   and consisted primarily of interest income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
interest income represents interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
interest income increased in and due to the impact of rising average interest rates and average investment balance in the past two years 
we anticipate that our interest income in will be greater than in in anticipation that the currently higher interest rates will sustain and that our positive cash flows from operating and financing activities continue to increase our average investment balance 
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of million in  million in and million in our effective income tax rate was for  for and for the effective income tax rate was significantly lower than our statutory rate in both and due to the recognition of approximately million and million  respectively  of income tax benefits from certain of our deferred tax assets in and  which had previously been offset by a valuation allowance 
we expect our effective income tax rate will be close to our statutory rate of  including state income taxes 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
our net deferred tax assets primarily relate to federal and state research and development credits and the temporary difference between book and tax depreciation expenses  partially offset by deferred tax liabilities recognized for intangible assets in the intellichem and synthematix acquisitions 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating losses from the acquisitions of synthematix may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
the net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in  if not utilized 
as of december   we had federal and california research and development tax credits of approximately  and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credits will begin to expire in  while the state research and development credits have no expiration date

recent accounting pronouncements share based payment on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we are required to adopt sfas r effective january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
we expect to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
in august  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r  classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued in exchange for employee services under fasb statement no 
r fsp fas r 
fsp fas r defers indefinitely the requirement of sfas that a share based payment to an employee subject to sfas r becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable gaap when the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee 
the guidance in fsp fas r will be applied upon initial adoption of sfas r 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r fsp fas r 
fsp fas r provides an exception to the application of the concept of mutual understanding in the determination of whether a grant date and  for an equity award  a measurement date has occurred 
the exception permits companies to measure compensation cost for equity awards to employees on the board approval date if certain conditions are met  provided that the communication to the employees occurs within a relatively short period of time from the approval date 
the guidance in fsp fas r will be applied upon initial adoption of sfas r 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r  transition election related to accounting for the income tax effects of share based payment awards fsp fas r 
fsp fsp fas r allows an elective short cut approach to simplify the calculation of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiency apic pool and provides guidance for the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows for companies that elect to adopt the simplified alternative method of calculating the apic pool 
the guidance in fsp fsp fas r is effective on november  we do not expect to adopt this elective alternative method in calculating the apic pool 
as permitted by sfas  through december   we have accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  have recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a material impact on our results of operations  although it will have no direct impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas r is expected to be additional expenses of between million to million  net of tax  or approximately diluted loss per share  in had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings per share in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements stock based compensation 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments in november  the fasb issued fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas and fas 
fsp fas and fas addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the guidance in fsp fas and fas shall be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period in october  fasb issued fasb staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
fsp fas 
fsp fas concludes that rental costs incurred during and after a construction period are for the right to control the use of a leased asset during and after construction of a lessee asset and that there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during the construction period and the right to use that asset after the construction period 
therefore  rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense 
the guidance in fsp fas is to be applied to the first reporting period beginning after december  this is consistent with how we have historically accounted for rental costs during a construction period and therefore we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inventory costs in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends arb  chapter to clarify that abnormal amount of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds in october  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force consensus on issue no 
 determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds eitf issue no 
 which provides guidance regarding how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria in paragraph of fasb statement when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with paragraph of fasb statement the effective date of eitf issue no 
has not been determined  but early application is permitted 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
it applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources this section discusses the effects of the changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows we had positive cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  and finished the year with cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million  after paying a net million in the acquisition of synthematix 
this compared to cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million at december  as of december   we had no long term liabilities 
our operating activities provided million  million and million of cash in   and  respectively 
the sources of cash for the three years were primarily the receipt of research and development funding from collaborative partners and revenue from product sales and licensing  partially offset by operating expenses 
we expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from our operating activities in the near future 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  in   and included in the cash used in investing activities was the million net cash paid associated with the acquisition of synthematix 
included in the cash used in investing activities was the million net cash paid associated with the acquisition of intellichem 
the other fluctuations from period to period were due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales  and maturity of our available for sale securities 
cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment was million  million and million  respectively  in   and included in the cash used in purchases of property  plant and equipment was million paid for a building which houses a number of our laboratories as well as some office space 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchases of property and equipment to support our expanding operations  including investing in the leasehold improvement of a newly leased facility in sunnyvale  california 
financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
these amounts are primarily the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under the employee share purchase plan in each of the three years 
current liabilities increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december  all current liabilities  with the exception of the warranty expense accrual  have increased in due to the expansion of our operations in warranty expense accrual has decreased as a number of our customers are now purchasing extended warranty programs which are included in deferred revenue rather than in warranty expense accrual 
backlog as of december   our customers have contractually committed to funding of approximately million and million  respectively  for year and beyond  for the purchase of symyx tools systems  licenses to our intellectual property and software  royalty for the sale of products containing symyx discovered materials and research work to be undertaken 
principal commitments our principal commitments consisted of our obligations under operating leases  our commitments to purchase inventory and fixed assets  and our commitments made for leasehold improvements 
as of december  and  our principal commitments were million and million  respectively 
our principal commitments increased significantly due primarily to the lease of additional facilities to accommodate the expansion of our business 
we expect to satisfy these obligations as they become due over the next ten years 
future principal commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years facility commitments purchase commitments total we believe that our current cash  available for sale securities balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the coming year 
nonetheless  we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements may require us to relinquish our rights to some of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
other commitments as discussed in the off balance sheet financing and related party transactions below  our committed investments related to the collaborative development and license agreement with intermolecular  inc as of december  were  we expect to meet this commitment in the next two years 
customer indemnification from time to time  we agree to indemnify our customers against certain third party liabilities  including liability if our products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the indemnification is typically limited to no more than the amount paid by the customer 
as of december   we were not subject to any pending intellectual property related litigation 
contingencies we do not believe that we are currently a party to any material pending legal proceedings 
we may become subject to legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
although the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  we do not currently expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we carry insurance with coverage and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  our management believes that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations 
off balance sheet financing and related party transactions we have not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities as of december  we have not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
the only transactions between us and related parties during were revenue received for software maintenance and support from ilypsa  inc of which we own approximately of outstanding common stock  totaled mario m 
rosati  one of our directors  is also a member of wilson sonsini goodrich rosati  professional corporation  which has provided legal services with respect to real estate issues  for which it has received compensation at normal commercial rates totaling  in on march   we entered into a collaborative development and license agreement and on december   we entered into an alliance agreement  with intermolecular  inc under the agreements  the two companies will work together to conduct research and development and other activities with respect to materials and high throughput technology for use in semiconductor applications 
each party is bearing its own expenses 
thomas baruch  one of our board members  is a director of intermolecular  inc and cmea ventures  of which mr 
baruch is a general partner  holds a interest in intermolecular  inc w 
henry weinberg  one of our executive officers  is a scientific advisory board member of intermolecular  inc and a holder of options to purchase  shares of common stock of intermolecular  inc in we recognized  in revenue associated with the sale of a core x module to intermolecular and a gain of  from the sale of a fixed asset with  net book value to intermolecular  inc for its original cost of  dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock 
we currently expect to retain future earnings  if any  to support the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments which have maturities of less than two years 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
at december  our investment portfolio was comprised of approximately million in money market funds and million in us corporate debt 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are therefore subject to interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity in thousands average interest rate mature in fair value as of december  available for sale securities average interest rate
