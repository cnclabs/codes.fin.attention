item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis represents an overview of the results of operations and financial condition of the corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes presented in item of this report 
important note regarding forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  expect  estimate  anticipate  believe  target  plan  project or continue or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or similar terminology  and are made on the basis of management s plans and current analyses of the corporation  its business and the industry as a whole 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  economic conditions  competition  interest rate sensitivity and exposure to regulatory and legislative changes 
the above factors in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the corporation s financial performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
the corporation does not undertake to update publicly or revise its forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any previous projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
application of critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions  and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
management currently views the determination of the allowance for loan losses  securities valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loans losses addresses credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is presented as a reserve against loans on the balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses  with recoveries of amounts previously charged off credited to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 

table of contents management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses considers individual impaired loans  pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics and other environmental risk factors 
the allowance established for individual impaired loans reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of all loans over a fixed dollar amount where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific impaired loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows  current market value of the loan and collateral values 
independent loan review results are evaluated and considered in estimating reserves as well as the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff 
the consideration of this component of the allowance requires considerable judgment in order to estimate inherent loss exposures 
pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics are also assessed for probable losses 
a loss migration and historical charge off analysis is performed quarterly and loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience 
this analysis examines historical loss experience  the related internal gradings of loans charged off and considers inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio 
inherent but undetected losses may arise due to uncertainties in economic conditions  delays in obtaining information  including unfavorable information about a borrower s financial condition  the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate perfectly to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors 
the corporation has grown through acquisition and expanded the geographic footprint in which it operates 
as a result  historical loss experience data used to establish loss estimates may not precisely correspond to the current portfolio 
also  loss data representing a complete economic cycle is not available for all sectors 
uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss 
the historical loss experience used in the migration and historical charge off analysis may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio 
management also evaluates the impact of environmental factors which pose additional risks that may not adequately be addressed in the analyses described above 
such environmental factors could include levels of  and trends in  consumer bankruptcies  delinquencies  impaired loans  charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery  experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry and geographic conditions  concentrations of credit such as  but not limited to  local industries  their employees or suppliers  or any other common risk factor that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio 
the determination of this component of the allowance requires considerable management judgment 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the allowance and provision for loan losses section of this financial review includes a discussion of the factors driving changes in the allowance for loan losses during the current period 
securities valuation investment securities  which are composed of debt securities and certain equity securities  comprise a significant portion of the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
such securities can be classified as securities available for trading  securities held to maturity or securities available for sale 
as of december  and  the corporation did not carry a portfolio of trading securities 
securities held to maturity are comprised of debt securities  which were purchased with management s positive intent and ability to hold such securities until their maturity 
such securities are carried at cost  adjusted for related amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts through interest income from securities 

table of contents securities that are not classified as trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
the corporation s available for sale securities portfolio is comprised of debt securities and marketable equity securities 
such securities are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses not deemed other than temporary reported separately as a component in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
realized gains and losses on the sale of and other than temporary impairment charges on available for sale securities are recorded on the statement of income 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
securities are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairment based upon a number of factors  including but not limited to  length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  financial condition of the underlying issuer  ability of the issuer to meet contractual obligations  the likelihood of the security s ability to recover any decline in its market value and management s intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value 
among the factors that are considered in determining management s intent and ability is a review of the corporation s capital adequacy  interest rate risk position and liquidity 
the assessment of a security s ability to recover any decline in market value  the ability of the issuer to meet contractual obligations and management s intent and ability requires considerable judgment 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is recorded as a loss within non interest income in the statement of income 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the businesses acquired 
the majority of the corporation s goodwill relates to value inherent in its community banking and insurance segments 
the amount of goodwill is impacted by the fair value of underlying assets and liabilities acquired  including loans  deposits and long term debt  which is significantly influenced by management s estimates and assumptions which are judgmental in nature 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
the corporation performs an internal valuation analysis and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  growth rate and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables 
the value of goodwill is dependent upon the corporation s ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the corporation s inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
income taxes the corporation is subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business 
the laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities 
in determining the provision for income taxes  management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws  related regulations and case law 
in the process of preparing the corporation s tax returns  management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws 
these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities based on audit or to interpretation based on management s ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law 
the corporation establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that the corporation will not be able to realize a benefit from its deferred tax assets  or when future deductibility is uncertain 
periodically  the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on management s assessments of realizable deferred tax assets 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based on its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes for the full year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are assessed on an annual basis  or sooner  if business events or circumstances warrant 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments the new and proposed accounting standards footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report  discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by the corporation in and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted

management believes the corporation has sufficient liquidity available to meet its normal operating and contingency funding cash needs 
market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk which results from its role as a financial intermediary 
to succeed in this capacity  the corporation offers an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of its customers 
these products sometimes create risk for the corporation when product groups do not compliment one another  for example depositors may want short term deposits while borrowers desire long term loans 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the alco is responsible for market risk management devising policy guidelines  risk measures and limits  and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
the corporation s treasury department measures interest rate risk and manages interest rate risk on a daily basis 
interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and options risk 
repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios 
basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices  which do not always change by the same amount 
yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve  when the yield curve changes shape  the risk position is altered 
options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans when rates fall while certain depositors can redeem their certificates early when rates rise 
the corporation uses a sophisticated asset liability model to measure its interest rate risk 
interest rate risk measures utilized by the corporation include earnings simulation  economic value of equity eve and gap analysis 
gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business 
gap analysis  while a helpful diagnostic tool  displays cash flows for only a single rate environment 
eve s long term horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longer term positions 
however  eve s liquidation perspective does not translate into the earnings based measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern 
net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest 
the corporation s current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios 
the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios 
reviewing these various measures provides the corporation with a reasonably comprehensive view of its interest rate profile 
the following gap analysis compares the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time 
the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a one year period was and at december  and  respectively 
a ratio of more than one indicates a higher level of repricing assets over repricing liabilities over the next twelve months

for example  if a product s rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates  then of the account balance was placed in this bucket 
the current allocation is representative of the estimated sensitivities for a basis point change in market rates 
the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of the corporation s annual net interest income and eve to sudden and parallel changes shocks in market rates versus if rates remained unchanged december net interest income change months basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points the preceding measures are within policy limits 
the overall level of interest rate risk has improved and is considered to be relatively low and stable 
the alco is responsible for the identification and management of interest rate risk exposure 
as such  the alco continuously evaluates strategies to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
since  short term interest rates have risen significantly while long term interest rates have increased only slightly 
this flattening of the yield curve has made short term deposits and long term loans more attractive to customers a situation that created additional interest rate risk for the corporation 
in order to keep the risk measures in an acceptable position  the alco crafted several strategies to mitigate its risk position 
during february  the corporation entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
under the agreement  the corporation will pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate based on the london inter bank offered rate libor 
the effective rate of the swap is january  and the maturity date is march  for additional information  refer to the interest rate swap section of the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation repositioned its investment portfolio in order to reduce its interest rate risk 
the transaction lowered the level of mortgage related assets held by the corporation which reduced the repricing risk 
table of contents and options risk of the corporation for additional information  refer to the securities footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of this report 
the corporation also locked in funding by utilizing long term wholesale fhlb advances 
in addition  the corporation regularly sells fixed rate  residential mortgages to the secondary mortgage loan market in order to manage its holdings of long term  fixed rate loans 
the corporation recognizes that asset liability models are based on methodologies that may have inherent shortcomings 
furthermore  asset liability models require certain assumptions be made  such as prepayment rates on earning assets and pricing impact on non maturity deposits  which may differ from actual experience 
these business assumptions are based upon the corporation s experience  business plans and published industry experience 
while management believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that modeled results will approximate actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that the corporation could employ in response to changes in market interest rates

this increase was offset by planned reductions in the indirect installment and automobile financing  which decreased by a combined million or 
these tactical reductions were part of a strategic initiative designed to improve asset quality and fee income while focusing on more advantageous loan originations consistent with relationship banking

non performing loans non performing loans include non accrual loans and restructured loans 
non accrual loans represent loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued 
restructured loans are loans in which the borrower has been granted a concession on the interest rate or the original repayment terms due to financial distress 
the corporation discontinues interest accruals when principal or interest is due and has remained unpaid for to days or more depending on the loan type 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all unpaid interest is reversed 
non accrual loans may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent principal and interest has been paid 
non performing loans are closely monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the corporation s loan review and work out process 
the potential risk of loss on these loans is evaluated by comparing the loan balance to the fair 
table of contents value of any underlying collateral or the present value of projected future cash flows 
losses are recognized where appropriate

allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio at a specific point in time 
this estimate includes losses associated with specifically identified loans  as well as estimated probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
additions are made to the allowance through both periodic provisions charged to income and recoveries of losses previously incurred 
reductions to the allowance occur as loans are charged off 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly  and in doing so relies on various factors including  but not limited to  assessment of historical loss experience  delinquency and non accrual trends  portfolio growth  underlying collateral coverage and current economic conditions 
this evaluation is subjective and requires material estimates that may change over time 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent estimates based upon financial accounting standards board statement fas  accounting for contingencies  and fas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
fas applies to homogeneous loan pools such as consumer installment  residential mortgages and consumer lines of credit  as well as commercial loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment under fas fas is applied to commercial loans that are considered impaired 
under fas  a loan is impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the loan will not be repaid according to its contractual terms  including both principal and interest 
management performs individual assessments of impaired loans to determine the existence of loss exposure and  where applicable  the extent of loss exposure based upon the present value of expected future cash flows available to pay the loan  or based upon the estimated realizable collateral where a loan is collateral dependent 
commercial loans excluded from fas individual impairment analysis are collectively evaluated by management to estimate reserves for loan losses inherent in those loans in accordance with fas in estimating loan loss contingencies  management applies historical loan loss rates and also considers how the loss rates may be impacted by changes in current economic conditions  delinquency and non performing loan 
table of contents trends  changes in loan underwriting guidelines and credit policies  as well as the results of internal loan reviews 
homogeneous loan pools are evaluated using similar criteria that are based upon historical loss rates of various loan types 
historical loss rates are adjusted to incorporate changes in existing conditions that may impact  both positively or negatively  the degree to which these loss histories may vary 
this determination inherently involves a high degree of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have occurred in the corporation s historical loan loss experience

the north east acquisition brought with it million in loans and associated allowance for loan losses of million  which represented of north east s loans 
offsetting these acquired reserves was a decrease of million in the provision for loan losses recorded during this same period 
this decrease in provision is a direct result of the corporation s improved asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses increased million during representing a increase in reserves for loan losses between december  and december  the increase in reserves for loan losses is attributed to the acquisition of slippery rock  which closed in october the slippery rock acquisition brought with it million in loans and associated reserves for loan losses of million  which represented 
table of contents of slippery rock s loans 
the credit risks introduced through the slippery rock loan portfolio supported the higher loan loss reserves reported at year end given the inherent risk of assets acquired 
management considers numerous factors when estimating reserves for loan losses  including historical charge off rates and subsequent recoveries 
consideration is given to the impact of changes in qualitative factors that influence the corporation s credit quality  such as the local and regional economies that the corporation serves 
assessment of relevant economic factors indicates that the corporation s primary markets tend to lag the national economy  with local economies in the corporation s market areas also improving  but at a more measured rate than the national trends 
regional economic factors influencing management s estimate of reserves include uncertainty of the labor markets in the regions the corporation serves and a contracting labor force due  in part  to productivity growth and industry consolidations  which influence the level of reserves 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are influenced by economic conditions within certain sectors of the economy  such as health care  manufacturing  automotive and the commercial office and commercial retail sub markets that are pressured by supply imbalances within certain market areas of the corporation 
pressures on the corporation s healthcare customers include skilled labor shortages  rising liability costs and the risk to medicaid payments as states balance tight budgets 
in  interest rates and energy costs increased  trends that have continued in rising rates directly affect borrowers tied to floating rate loans as increasing debt service requirements pressure customers that now face higher loan payments 
the corporation also considers how rising interest rates and energy costs influence consumer loan customers who now carry historically high debt loads 
consumer credit risk and loss exposures are evaluated using loss histories of the fas pools and roll rate analysis to estimate credit quality migration and expected losses within the homogeneous loan pools 
charge offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were estimated previously through provisions for credit losses 
loans charged off during increased million to million over charge offs  primarily due to the charge off of a million loan that was previously fully reserved 
net charge offs annualized as a percent of average loans decreased to 
in compared to 
in reflecting improved performance 
loans charged off in decreased million to million versus loans charged off in increased million compared to loans charged off in decreased million over the provision for loan losses was significantly influenced by the level of net charge offs taken by promistar financial corporation promistar prior to its acquisition by the corporation in the weak economy in southwestern pennsylvania  which existed in  and the overall economic climate subsequent to september resulted in deterioration in the credit quality of several significant commercial loans 
in addition  promistar began to experience credit quality deterioration within the indirect consumer auto loan portfolio as loan loss and delinquency trends increased 
as a result  promistar charged off million in loans and recorded a provision for loan losses of million during following is a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands of loans of loans of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each in each in each category to category to category to category to category to dec  total dec

the amounts allocated to consumer lines of credit and residential mortgages increased in primarily as a result of the increased loan balances associated with the nsd acquisition 
the amounts allocated to both commercial loans and direct installment loans increased in primarily as a result of the increased loan balances associated with the slippery rock acquisition

this enhancement resulted in allocation of the entire allowance to the specific loan portfolios 
investment activity investment activities serve to enhance the overall yield on earning assets while supporting interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions 
securities purchased with the intent and ability to retain until maturity are categorized as securities held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
all other securities are categorized as securities available for sale and are recorded at fair market value 
securities are subject to similar interest rate and credit risk as loans 
in addition  by their nature  securities classified as available for sale are also subject to market value risks that could negatively affect the level of liquidity available to the corporation  as well as equity 
a change in value of held to maturity securities could also negatively affect the level of equity if there was a decline in the underlying creditworthiness of the issuers or a change in the corporation s intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
during  securities available for sale decreased by million and securities held to maturity increased by million from december  during the fourth quarter of  management changed its intent with respect to certain available for sale debt securities and as a result sold million of fixed rate securities with an average yield of and an average life of three years resulting in a realized loss of million 
these sales were part of the corporation s initiative to improve its interest rate risk position and improve future income levels 
the proceeds from the sale were used to retire million of higher rate short term borrowings and to purchase million of shorter maturity securities that have an average life of two years 
as of december   securities with an amortized cost of million and million were classified as available for sale and held to maturity  respectively 
management believes the corporation has sufficient liquidity available to meet its normal operating cash needs despite the increase in securities in the held to maturity portfolio from during  the corporation transferred million from available for sale to held to maturity 
this transaction resulted in million being recorded as other comprehensive income  which is being amortized over the remaining average life of the securities transferred 
the corporation initiated this transfer to better reflect management s intentions and to reduce the volatility of the equity adjustment due to the fluctuation in market prices of available for sale securities
