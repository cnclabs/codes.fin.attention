item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information  including our financial statements and the notes thereto  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading us steel service center with over years of experience 
our primary focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon  coated and stainless flat rolled sheet  coil and plate products 
we act as an intermediary between steel producers and manufacturers that require processed steel for their operations 
we serve customers in most carbon steel consuming industries  including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling equipment  automobiles  construction and farm machinery  storage tanks  environmental and energy generation  food service and electrical equipment  as well as general and plate fabricators  and steel service centers 
we distribute our products primarily through a direct sales force 
we operate as a single business segment with strategically located processing and distribution facilities in connecticut  georgia  illinois  iowa  michigan  minnesota  ohio and pennsylvania 
this geographic footprint allows us to focus on regional customers and larger national and multi national accounts  primarily located throughout the midwestern  eastern and southern united states 
our gsp  llc gsp joint venture is a certified minority business enterprise company supporting the flat rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry 
in january  we announced plans to close the olympic laser processing olp joint venture facility in detroit  michigan 
olp  which was a processor of laser welded steel blanks for the automotive industry  ceased operations in the first quarter of our interest in gsp and our interest in olp are accounted for under the equity method 
we sell a broad range of steel products  many of which have different gross profits and margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross profit and higher margins 
accordingly  our overall gross profit is affected by  among other things  product mix  the amount of processing performed  the availability of steel  volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
we also perform toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by our detroit and georgia operations 
we sell certain products internationally  primarily in puerto rico and mexico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
recent international sales have been immaterial to our consolidated financial results 
our results of operations are affected by numerous external factors including  but not limited to  general and global business  economic and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  energy prices  pricing and availability of raw materials used in the production of steel  customer demand for steel and their ability to manage their credit line availability and layoffs or work stoppages by our own  our suppliers or our customers personnel 
the collective bargaining agreement covering hourly plant employees at our minneapolis plate facility expires april  collective bargaining agreements covering our detroit and other minneapolis employees expire in and subsequent years 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good 
however  any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
estimates are revised periodically 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
estimations are based upon the application of an historical collection rate to the outstanding accounts receivable balance  which remains fairly level from year to year  and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers  which can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
we cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience 
we consider all available information when assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs of the purchased steel  internal and external processing  and inbound freight 
cost is determined using the specific identification method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we record an impairment or change in useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed 
income taxes deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet include  as an offset to the estimated temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated balance sheets  the tax effect of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
for both direct and toll shipments  revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss is transferred which generally occurs upon delivery to our customers 
given the proximity of our customers to our facilities  virtually all of our sales are shipped and received within one day 
sales returns and allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for the years ended december   and dollars shown in thousands of net of net of net sales sales sales net sales gross profit a operating expenses b operating income a gross profit is calculated as net sales less the cost of materials sold  exclusive of depreciation 
b operating expenses are calculated as total costs and expenses less the cost of materials sold 
compared to tons sold in decreased to million from million last year 
tons sold in included million from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with million direct tons and thousand toll tons in the decrease in tons sold in was primarily attributable to lower sales to automotive customers  lower sales to other service centers and lower overall demand across most sectors in when compared to net sales in increased to million from million 
average selling prices for increased from higher levels of inventory held by steel service centers and end use customers led to competitive pressures and declining selling prices during the first nine months of average selling prices began increasing during the third quarter of and the higher selling prices were sustained during the fourth quarter of we expect steel selling prices in the first quarter of to be relatively consistent with the fourth quarter of in  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to from in as the base price of steel declined  competitive pressures resulted in lower selling prices and gross margin during the first nine months of gross margin levels began increasing during the end of the third quarter of and the increased gross margin levels were sustained during the fourth quarter of as average selling prices increased 
while first quarter steel selling prices are expected to remain relatively consistent with fourth quarter levels  we expect gross margin levels in the first quarter of to decrease from the fourth quarter of as higher costed inventory is sold 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for decreased to from in operating expenses for decreased to million from million in the decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of lower variable compensation in  partially offset by higher distribution costs 
in  losses from joint ventures totaled thousand compared with income of thousand in we also recorded a million loss on the disposition of our olp joint venture  which includes writing off our million equity investment and covering an estimated million under our guarantee of olp s debt 
financing costs for decreased to million from million in during  we repaid all outstanding bank debt and we remained free of bank debt as of december  we retain the ability to borrow up to million against our revolving credit facility 
we expect our debt levels during the first quarter of to remain relatively low 
all deferred financing costs had been fully amortized as of december  in  we reported income before income taxes of million  compared to million in an income tax provision of was recorded during  compared to in taxes paid in totaled million  compared to million in we expect our effective tax rate in to be slightly lower than in net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in compared to tons sold in increased to million from million in tons sold in included million from direct sales and thousand from toll processing  compared with thousand direct tons and thousand toll tons in the increase in tons sold was attributable to increased customer demand across substantially all steel consuming markets 
tons sold in the fourth quarter of were lower  particularly sales to other service centers  as a result of higher inventories at service centers 
net sales in increased to million from million 
strong customer demand  combined with tight supply and rising raw material costs for steel production  resulted in a dramatic increase in steel pricing 
average selling prices for increased from market prices for steel declined in the seasonally slower fourth quarter 
in gross profit increased to from in the gross profit increase was primarily the result of strong customer demand for steel coupled with tight supply conditions 
during we were able to pass on to our customers steel producers price increases and surcharges 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses for decreased to from in operating expenses for increased to million from million in operating expenses increased primarily from increased variable costs  including payroll  performance based incentive compensation  retirement plan expenses and distribution expenses associated with increased sales volume and income during in  income from joint ventures totaled thousand compared with losses of million in financing costs for increased to million from million in our effective borrowing rate inclusive of deferred financing fees for was compared to in we have the option to borrow based on the agent bank s base rate or eurodollar rate euro plus a premium 
effective borrowing rates primarily increased as a result of the amortization of loan fees charged by our bank group for the period ended december  in  we reported income before income taxes of million compared to the loss before income taxes of million 
an income tax provision of was recorded during compared to a benefit recorded during taxes paid in totaled million 
there were no taxes paid during net income for totaled million or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  the purchasing and upgrading of processing equipment and facilities  investing in joint ventures and potential acquisitions and infrastructure  technology investments and the payment of quarterly dividends 
we use cash generated from operations  leasing transactions  and our credit facility to fund these requirements 
working capital at december  decreased million from the end of the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in inventories and a million increase in accounts payable offset  in part  by a million decrease in accrued payroll and accrued liabilities 
during  we generated million of net cash from operations  of which million was derived from cash earnings and million from working capital reductions 
we used million of cash to pay down debt and million for capital spending 
over the next months  we expect to increase our capital spending significantly over recent levels 
in january  we purchased a  square foot facility in chambersburg  pennsylvania for million to expand our plate processing and machining activities in that geographic area 
we plan on adding at least six new laser processing lines during which will be financed through operating leases 
we also anticipate using our financial position to take advantage of the consolidating service center industry 
our secured bank financing agreement the credit facility is a revolving credit facility collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventories  and substantially all of our property and equipment 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base  comprised of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  or million in the aggregate 
in june  we entered into an amendment of the credit facility which i extended the maturity of the existing credit facility from december  to december   and ii added an accordion feature which allows up to million of additional availability at a future date  subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the amendment 
during fees and expenses associated with the origination and amendment of the credit facility were amortized to interest and other expense on debt 
all such costs were fully amortized as of december  the credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants  the most significant of which include i minimum availability of million  tested monthly  ii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  and a maximum leverage ratio of  which are tested quarterly  iii restrictions on additional indebtedness  and iv limitations on capital expenditures and investments 
at december   we had million of availability and were in compliance with our covenants 
we believe that funds available under our credit facility  together with funds generated from operations and leases  will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements over the next months 
capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations as of december  open purchase orders for raw materials and supplies used in the normal course of business have been excluded from the following table 
contractual obligations less than more than amounts in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations loan guarantee obligations other long term liabilities operating leases total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has a made guarantees  b a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  c any obligation under certain derivative instruments or d any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to a company  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services within a company 
as of december   we guaranteed of olp s million and of gsp s million of outstanding debt on a several basis 
these guarantees were a requirement of the joint venture companies financing agreements 
as part of the million loss on disposition of joint venture shown on our consolidated statements of operations  we anticipate funding million under our guarantee of olp s debt in effects of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r 
sfas r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those securities 
sfas r also requires an entity to recognize the cost of employee services received in share based payment transactions  thereby reflecting the economic consequences of those transactions in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all awards granted on or after july   and to awards modified  vested  repurchased  or canceled after that date 
due to the relatively few number of stock options vesting after the effective date  sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb staff issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations as well as other issues related to asset retirement obligations 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk during  steel producers were significantly impacted by a shortage of raw materials  rising raw material prices  increased product demand  producer consolidation and longer lead time requirements 
these conditions resulted in unprecedented cost increases and translated into higher gross profit dollars and margin percentages 
during  we were able to pass producers price increases and surcharges on to our customers 
the base price of carbon flat rolled steel began declining in september  continuing into august higher levels of inventory at steel service centers and end use customers caused competitive pressures which compressed gross margin percentages during the first nine months of steel prices began increasing in the third quarter or and remained relatively level during the fourth quarter of we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
we have not entered into any interest rate or steel commodity hedge transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy  and borrowings under our credit facility 
general inflation has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years  however  we have experienced increased distribution expenses as a result of higher fuel costs 
when raw material prices increase  competitive conditions will influence how much of the steel price increase can be passed on to our customers 
when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower costed product result in lower selling prices 
declining steel prices have generally adversely affected our net sales and net income while increasing steel prices have favorably affected net sales and net income 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from variable rate debt 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to variable interest rate risk 
however  we have the option to enter into to day fixed base rate euro loans under the credit facility
