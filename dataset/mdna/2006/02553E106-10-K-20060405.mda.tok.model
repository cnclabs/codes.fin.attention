item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue at the time the goods are shipped 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
revenue is not recorded on the sell off of end of season  overstock and irregular merchandise to off price retailers 
these sell offs are typically sold below cost and the proceeds are reflected in cost of sales 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 

table of contents asset impairment 
we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
our management evaluates the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
assets are evaluated for impairment when undiscounted future cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of those assets 
when events such as these occur  the assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
legal proceedings and claims 
we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the conduct of our business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  our management records a reserve for estimated losses when the loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if a range of possible loss exists  we record the accrual at the low end of the range  in accordance with fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
as management believes that we have provided adequate reserves  we anticipate that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against us will not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance reserve 
we are self insured for certain losses related to employee medical benefits 
costs for self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based on known claims and historical experience 
we believe that we have adequately reserved for our self insurance liability  which is capped through the use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies 
however  any significant variation of future claims from historical trends could cause actual results to differ from the accrued liability 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales 
comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
management considers comparable store sales to be a good indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent and other operating expenses 
positive comparable store sales generally contribute to leveraging of costs while negative comparable store sales contribute to deleveraging of costs 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit 
gross profit measures whether we are appropriately optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing 
table of contents costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation and travel for our buyers  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  and compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs 
an inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or a significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income 
management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the primary drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit and our ability to control operating costs 
store productivity 
store productivity  including sales per square foot  average unit retail price  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover 
management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity 
management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements
