table of contents competition from other manufacturers of generic drugs affecting our generic products the success of our generic business is based in part on successfully developing and bringing to market a steady flow of generic products 
we attempt to select our generic products based on the prospects for limited competition from competing generic companies 
we do so because we believe that the more generic competitors that market the same generic product  the lower the revenue and profitability we will record for our product 
therefore  if any of our currently marketed products or any newly launched generic product are subject to additional generic competition from one or more competing products  our price and market share for the affected generic product could be dramatically reduced 
as a consequence  unless we successfully replace generic products that are declining in profitability with new generic products with higher profitability  our business could be adversely affected 
our largest single category of generic products is oral contraceptives  which accounted for approximately million in revenues in fiscal in addition  we recorded revenues of million or more from each of two other generic products  desmopressin  and royalties from the sale of a generic version of allegra by teva pharmaceuticals 
two generic manufacturers have already launched a competing generic version of desmopressin  and there are two competing generic allegra products in addition to teva s 
we anticipate added competition to desmopressin and allegra over time 
in addition  we anticipate increasing competition to our generic oral contraceptives over time 
unless we can replace the anticipated losses of revenues from these products with revenues from new products  our revenues and profitability will suffer 
competition from other manufacturers of generic drugs affecting our proprietary products upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity periods for one of our branded products  or upon the at risk launch by a generic manufacturer of a generic version of one of our branded products  we can lose the major portion of sales of that product in a very short period  which can adversely affect our business 
for example  seasonale  our largest selling proprietary product  generated million in revenues during fiscal in may a competitor received tentative fda approval for a generic version of seasonale and may be eligible for final approval following the expiration of our regulatory exclusivity on september  if the competitor launches its product  our revenues and gross profit contributions from seasonale will decline significantly 
resolving paragraph iv patent challenges our operating results have historically included significant contributions from products that arise from the success we have had from our patent challenge activities 
however  the success we have had in the past from 
table of contents challenging branded companies patents  whether through court decisions that permit us to launch our generic versions of product or through settlements  may not be repeated in the future due to the following an increase in the number of competitors who pursue patent challenges could make it more difficult for us to be first to file a paragraph iv certification on a patent protected product  a branded company s decision to launch an authorized generic version of the product will reduce our market share and lower the revenues and gross profits we could have otherwise earned if an authorized generic were not launched  claims brought by third parties  including the ftc  various states attorneys general and other third party payers challenging the legality of our settlement agreements could affect the way in which we resolve our patent challenges with the brand pharmaceutical companies  and the efforts of brand companies to use legislative and regulatory tactics to delay the launch of generic products 
impact of at risk launches there are situations where we have used our business and legal judgment and decided to market and sell products  subject to claims of alleged patent infringement  prior to final resolution by the courts  based upon our belief that such patents are invalid  unenforceable  or would not be infringed 
this is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an at risk launch 
the risk involved in doing so can be substantial because if a patent holder ultimately prevails  the remedies available to such holder include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the holder which are often significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product 
should we elect to proceed in this manner we could face substantial damages if the final court decision is adverse to us 
in the case where a patent holder was able to prove that our infringement was willful  the definition of which is subjective  such damages may be trebled 
government regulation and managed care trends the trend toward managed healthcare in the us  the growth of organizations such as hmos and mcos and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products  resulting in lower prices and a reduction in product demand 
such cost containment measures and healthcare reform could affect our ability to sell our products and may have a material adverse effect on us 
additionally  reimbursements to patients may not be maintained and third party payers  which place limits on levels of reimbursement  may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  those products and could significantly harm our business 
we may also be subject to lawsuits relating to reimbursement programs that could be costly to defend  divert management s attention and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
development and regulatory approval risks and uncertainties particularly apply to whether or when our products will be approved 
the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of developing new products is inherently uncertain 
for our generic business  much of our product development efforts are focused on developing products that are difficult to formulate and or products that require specialized manufacturing technology 
the inability to successfully formulate and pass bioequivalence studies can adversely affect the timing of when we receive approval for our generic products 
for our proprietary business  regulatory delays  the inability to successfully complete clinical trials or claims and concerns about safety and efficacy are a few of the factors that could adversely affect the timing of new 
table of contents proprietary product launches 
in addition decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters could adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our products 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will receive regulatory approval for new products 
product manufacturing and marketing difficulties or delays in product manufacturing or marketing  including  but not limited to  the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand  or the failure to predict market demand for  or to gain market acceptance of approved products  including our recent launches of seasonique and enjuvia  could affect future results 
dependence on third parties we rely on third parties to supply us with raw materials  inactive ingredients and other components for our manufactured products and for certain of our finished goods 
in many instances there is only a single supplier 
in addition  we rely on third party distributors and alliance partners to provide services for our business  including product development  manufacturing  warehousing  distribution  customer service support  medical affairs services  clinical studies  sales and other technical and financial services for certain of our products 
nearly all third party suppliers and contractors are subject to fda  and in some cases dea  requirements 
our business on some products are dependent on the regulatory compliance of these third parties  and on the strength  validity and terms of our various contracts with these third party manufacturers  distributors and collaboration partners 
any interruption or failure by these suppliers  distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements or obligations with us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our revenues include amounts we earn based on sales generated and recorded by teva pharmaceuticals for generic allegra  and kos pharmaceuticals for niaspan and advicor 
any factors that negatively impact the sales of these products could adversely impact our revenues and profits 
customer consolidation our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains 
this consolidation may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business 
additionally  the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions potentially enable those groups to attempt to extract price discounts on our products 
our net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors  retail chains and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions or other factors 
cost and expense control unusual events growth in costs and expenses  changes in product mix and the impact of acquisitions  divestitures  restructurings  product withdrawals and other unusual events that could result from evolving business strategies  evaluation of asset realization and organizational restructuring could create volatility in our results 
such risks and uncertainties include  in particular  the potentially significant charges to our operating results for items like in process research and development charges and transaction costs 
legal proceedings as described in legal proceedings in part i  item of this form k  we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various patent  product liability  consumer and commercial litigations and claims  government investigations  and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 

table of contents litigation is inherently unpredictable  and unfavorable rulings do occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or  in some rare cases  for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting barr from manufacturing or selling one or more products 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period 
availability of product liability insurance our business inherently exposes us to claims relating to the use of our products 
we sell  and will continue to sell  pharmaceutical products for which product liability insurance coverage may not be available  and  accordingly  if we are sued and if adverse judgments are rendered  we may be subject to claims that are not covered by insurance as well as claims that exceed our policy limits each of which could adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition 
additional products for which we currently have coverage may be excluded in the future 
in addition  product liability coverage for pharmaceutical companies is becoming more expensive and increasingly difficult to obtain 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain the type and amount of coverage we desire 
acquisitions we regularly review potential acquisitions of products and companies complementary to our business 
acquisitions typically entail many risks including  difficulties in integrating operations  personnel  technologies and products 
if we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions  we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows  our ability to develop and introduce new products 
managing rapidly growing operations we have grown significantly over the past several years  extending our processes  systems and people 
we have made significant investments in enterprise resource systems and our internal control processes to help manage this growth 
we must also attract  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  sales and marketing and support positions to support our growth 
as a result  hiring and retaining qualified executives  scientists  technical staff  manufacturing personnel  qualified quality and regulatory professionals and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for these people can be intense 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees and if we do not continue to invest in systems and processes to manage our growth  our operations could be adversely impacted 
use of estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying accounting policies have a significant impact of our results of operations see critical accounting policies in part ii  item of this form k 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that leads us to change them 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 
changes in laws and accounting standards our future results could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  competition laws and environmental laws in the us and other countries 
terrorist activity our future results could be adversely affected by changes in business  political and economic conditions  including the cost and availability of insurance  due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the us and other parts of the world and related us military action overseas 

table of contents potential acquisition of pliva dd on august   we initiated a tender offer to purchase of the shares of pliva  a billion generic pharmaceutical company headquartered in zagreb  croatia 
our tender offer was for approximately billion plus the assumption of approximately million in existing debt of pliva 
if we are successful in the tender process  we will immediately begin the integration of the two companies 
there are a number of operational and financial risks associated with this potential acquisition 
the operational risks include  but are not limited to  the following the necessity of coordinating and consolidating geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  the successful integration of our management and personnel with that of pliva and retaining key employees  changes in intellectual property legal protections and remedies  trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval  production  pricing  reimbursement and marketing of products 
the financial risks related to this potential acquisition include  but are not limited to  the following our ability to satisfy debt obligations under the billion senior credit facility we entered into to help finance this transaction  the ability of the combined company to meet certain revenue and cost synergy objectives  charges associated with this transaction  including the write off of acquired in process research and development costs  additional depreciation and amortization of acquired assets and interest expense and other financing costs related to the senior credit facility will negatively impact our net income  our international based revenues and expenses will be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
if management is unable to successfully integrate the operations and manage the financial risks  the anticipated benefits of this potential acquisition may not be realized 
on august  a competing offer to acquire pliva was announced 
as a result  we may be required to increase our bid 
if we are unsuccessful in acquiring pliva  we will incur a significant charge to operations reflecting costs we have incurred to date that have been capitalized

table of contents item legal proceedings litigation settlement on october   we entered into a settlement agreement with schein pharmaceutical  inc now part of watson pharmaceuticals  inc 
relating to a agreement regarding the pursuit of a generic conjugated estrogens product 
under the terms of the settlement  schein relinquished any claim to rights in cenestin in exchange for a payment of million made to schein in an additional million payment is required under the terms of the settlement if cenestin achieves total profits  as defined  of greater than million over any rolling five year period prior to october  as of june   no liability is estimated to be incurred related to this settlement 
litigation matters we are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to our business  including product liability  intellectual property and other commercial litigation and antitrust actions 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
additionally  we record insurance receivable amounts from third party insurers when appropriate 
many claims involve highly complex issues relating to patent rights  causation  label warnings  scientific evidence and other matters 
often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and therefore  the probability of loss and an estimate of the amount of the loss are difficult to determine 
our assessments are based on estimates that we  in consultation with outside advisors  believe are reasonable 
although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters  litigation is inherently unpredictable 
consequently  we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in a particular period 
summarized below are the more significant matters pending to which we are a party 
as of june   our reserve for the liability associated with claims or related defense costs for these matters is not material

generic products for many years  we have successfully utilized a strategy of developing the generic versions of branded products that possess some combination of unique factors that we believe have the effect of limiting competition for generics 
such factors include difficult formulation  complex and costly manufacturing requirements or limited raw material availability 
to date  our strategy has focused on developing solid oral dosage forms of products 
by targeting products with some combination of these unique factors  we believe that our generic products will  in general  be less affected by the intense and rapid pricing pressure often associated with more commodity type generic products 
as a result of this focused strategy  we have been able to successfully identify  develop and market generic products that generally have few competitors or that are able to enjoy longer periods of limited competition and thus generate profit margins higher than those often associated with commodity type generic products 
the development and launch of our generic oral contraceptive products is an example of our generic development strategy 
while we believe there are more tablet and capsule products that may fit our barrier to entry criteria  we recognize that it may be difficult to find highly profitable generic tablet and capsule products that will grow our generics business 
as a result  we have recently expanded our development activities  both internally and through collaboration with third parties  to develop non tablet and non capsule products such as patches  sterile ophthalmics and nasal sprays 
challenging the patents covering certain brand products continues to be an integral part of our generics business 
for many products  the patent provides the unique barrier that we seek to identify in our product selection process 
we try to be the first company to initiate a patent challenge because in certain cases  we may be able to obtain days of exclusivity for selling the generic version of the product 
upon receiving exclusivity for a product  we often experience significant revenues and profitability associated with that product for the day exclusivity period  but at the end of that period experience significant decreases in our revenues and market share associated with the product as other generic competitors enter the market 
our record of successfully resolving patent challenges has made a recurring contribution to our operating results  but has created periods of revenue and earnings volatility and will likely do so in the future 
while earnings and cash flow volatility may result from the launch of products subject to patent challenges  we remain committed to this part of our business 
macroeconomic factors continue to favor the use of generic pharmaceutical products 
the aging population  rising health care costs and the vigilance of health care providers  insurance companies and others to lower such costs have helped drive an increase in the substitution of lower cost generic products for higher cost brand products 
as evidence of this  the percentage of overall prescriptions filled with generic products grew from in to by  and is predicted to continue to rise in the future 

table of contents proprietary products to help diversify our generic product revenue base and to provide for additional long term opportunities  we initiated a program more than five years ago to develop and market proprietary pharmaceutical products 
we formalized this program in by establishing duramed research 
today  duramed is recognized as a leader in the area of women s healthcare 
our women s healthcare platform is based on a substantial number of employees dedicated to the development and marketing of our proprietary products including approximately sales representatives that promote directly to physicians five of our products seasonique  enjuvia  mircette  paragard and plan b and two products related to the co promotion agreement with kos pharmaceuticals niaspan and advicor 
growth in proprietary product sales over the last three fiscal years has been accomplished through increasing sales of our internally developed product seasonale  the first and largest selling extended cycle oral contraceptive in the united states 
in addition  our proprietary sales have grown through product acquisitions including our acquisition in november  of paragard  the only non drug loaded iud on the market in the united states  and the acquisition in december of mircette  a well established day oral contraceptive 
competition our successful generic product strategy has attracted new competitors seeking to launch competing generic products as well as to be first to file for potentially lucrative patent challenges 
for example  other generic pharmaceutical companies are developing and marketing competing generic oral contraceptives in order to capture some of our market share 
in addition  there has been an increase in the number of competitors in the generic industry that are based outside the us  with several of such competitors based in india 
many of these companies claim to have equivalent technological capabilities to us based generic companies but at significant cost advantages over barr and other us based generic competitors 
also  as a detriment to the value of the patent challenge strategy of barr and other leading generic manufacturers  brand pharmaceutical companies continue to partner with certain generic drug companies to license a so called authorized generic to the generic drug company 
the use of authorized generics by certain brand and generic companies undermines the value of the day exclusivity period enjoyed by the first company to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification by providing another company with the ability to have a competing generic product on the market at the same time 
as our proprietary pharmaceutical business continues to grow  we anticipate that competing generic pharmaceutical companies will challenge the patents protecting our branded products 
for example  as discussed above  one of our competitors has filed a paragraph iv certification challenging the patent on seasonale 
in may  the competitor s anda received tentative fda approval and may be eligible for final approval following the expiration of our regulatory exclusivity on september  in addition  larger branded pharmaceutical companies  such as wyeth  have sought to enter the extended cycle oral contraceptive market and compete against our seasonale seasonique franchise 
to address these and other challenges  we continue to invest aggressively in research and development  develop and launch new generic and proprietary products and maintain an active acquisition and licensing effort to complement our internal development activities 
proposed pliva acquisition on june   we announced that the supervisory board of pliva  a generic pharmaceuticals company with revenues of approximately billion  headquartered in zagreb  croatia  had endorsed our proposal to make a tender offer to pliva s shareholders to purchase of the shares of pliva 
on july   in accordance with the law of the republic of croatia governing tender offers  our newly formed european subsidiary  barr laboratories europe bv  officially filed our tender offer with hanfa 
under the terms of the billion cash tender offer  pliva shareholders who 
table of contents tender their shares will receive hrk per share in cash 
in addition  shareholders that are registered as shareholders at the central depository agency as of august  will receive the dividend of hrk per share  for a total cash consideration of hrk per share 
on august   hanfa approved for publication our tender offer 
if we are successful in the tender process we expect the acquisition to close in october or november on august   another pharmaceutical company filed a competing bid with hanfa  though that bid had not been approved as of the date of this filing 
if we acquire pliva  the combined company would be the third largest global generic pharmaceutical company  based on the combined revenues of approximately billion revenue for the twelve month period ended march  we believe that the combination of barr and pliva will unite the unique pharmaceutical development and manufacturing strengths of each partner  the unique markets in which each excels  and the expertise of a us based and european based management team to create a powerful  global pharmaceutical leader with a broad portfolio of solid oral dosage form products with the ability to create a broad portfolio of injectable  cream ointment  and biopharmaceutical products 
in addition  the combined company will have active pharmaceutical ingredient api capabilities 
the combination would also provide a solid foundation for accelerating the development of generic biopharmaceutical products  building upon pliva s biologic research program and the existing development venture between pliva and barr for g csf in north america  which we entered into in march we intend to finance the purchase price and transaction costs with a portion of our cash reserves and borrowings under a new senior credit facility that we entered into on july  the senior credit facility consists of billion of term loans and a million revolving credit facility 

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth revenue data for the fiscal years ended june  and s in millions change generic products oral contraceptives other generic total generic products proprietary products total product sales alliance  development and other revenue total revenues product sales product sales for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal increased over product sales for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  resulting from increases in sales of both generic and proprietary products 
generic sales increased in large part due to contributions from desmopressin  which we launched at the beginning of fiscal  combined with continued strong sales of two of our generic oral contraceptive products  tri sprintec and kariva 
proprietary sales increased in part due to contributions of products acquired during fiscal as well as higher sales of promoted in line products  including seasonale and plan b 
generic products oral contraceptives for fiscal  sales of generic oral contraceptives increased to million from sales of million in fiscal sales in this category benefited from strong performances from tri sprintec and kariva 
tri sprintec sales increased  driven in part by market share gains during the second half of fiscal  while sales of kariva were up due both to an increase in market share and higher pricing 
we believe that tri sprintec s market share gains were the result of supply shortages encountered by one of our competitors  which we understand have been remedied 
therefore  we expect our tri sprintec market share to decline over the next twelve months  with a related decrease in our product sales attributable to tri sprintec 
somewhat offsetting the strong performances by tri sprintec and kariva was the impact of increased pricing pressure from competition on certain of our other products  including aviane and apri  as well as the ongoing decline in consumer demand for several generic oral contraceptive products that occurs when brand companies cease promotional activities after a generic is launched 
these factors more than offset continued increases in the generic substitution rates for nearly all of our generic oral contraceptive products 
generic products other for fiscal  sales of other generic products increased to million from million in fiscal  driven by strong performances from desmopressin and didanosine 
we launched desmopressin in july  and recorded approximately million of sales during fiscal we launched didanosine during the middle of fiscal  and saw sales increase year over year 
desmopressin sales  which were favorably impacted in the first half of fiscal by rapid generic substitution  declined sharply in the second half due to the launch of two competing generic products 
we expect desmopressin sales to be lower in the next twelve months as a result of this competition 

table of contents these increases were partially offset by lower sales of mirtazapine  claravis and warfarin sodium  as well as the continued decline in both price and demand for certain of our other generic products 
mirtazapine sales were lower due to further price declines and a loss of market share 
claravis sales were lower throughout fiscal due in large part to the decline in the overall compound usage and lower prices 
as discussed in previous filings  sales of claravis and other isotrentinoin products indicated for the treatment of severe acne have been negatively affected by the implementation effective january  of ipledge  an enhanced risk management program that is designed to minimize fetal exposure to isotrentinoin that has also led to reduced product use 
sales of warfarin sodium declined due to lower prices  more than offsetting higher unit volume due primarily to an increase in our market share 
proprietary products for fiscal  proprietary product sales increased to million from million in fiscal this increase was driven by increase in sales of seasonale  the inclusion of sales of the paragard iud and of the mircette oral contraceptive  which we acquired in november and december  respectively  the launch of enjuvia during the fourth quarter of and higher volume and pricing for our plan b emergency contraceptive product 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of our loestrin loestrin fe oral contraceptive products and our cenestin hormone therapy product  due in part to customer buying patterns 
seasonale sales reached million during fiscal  up from fiscal sales 
higher prices for seasonale during fiscal more than offset lower customer shipments which were attributable to customer buying patterns during the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  consumer demand for seasonale grew  as prescriptions increased compared to last year 
in june  we received notification that a competitor had filed an anda containing a paragraph iv certification asserting that the patent covering seasonale is invalid  unenforceable or would not be infringed by the competitor s generic product 
in may  the competitor s anda received tentative fda approval and may be eligible for final approval following the expiration of our regulatory exclusivity on september  in july  we submitted a citizens petition  asking the office of generic drugs of the fda to make the determination that no anda submitted referencing our nda for seasonale be granted final approval unless and until such anda satisfies all statutory and regulatory requirements for bioequivalence 
our request with the office of generic drugs is pending 
the competitor has stated publicly that it expects to launch a generic version of seasonale in the fourth quarter of calendar if that launch occurs  seasonale sales will decline significantly 
in july  we submitted the patent covering seasonale for reissue with the patent and trademark office pto 
in may  we received a non final rejection notice from pto regarding our application for reissue of the patent 
in july  we responded to the issues raised by the pto in its non final rejection 
it is unlikely that the applicable patent could be reissued prior to expiration of our regulatory exclusivity on seasonale 
the patent covering seasonale will remain in effect and continue to be listed in the fda s orange book while the pto reviews the request for re issuance 
if the patent covering seasonale is reissued  it will have the same remaining term as the existing patent that expires in as part of our long term plans for our extended cycle contraceptive franchise  we launched seasonique in july seasonique represents the next generation of our extended cycle oral contraceptives  as discussed earlier in this report 
in july  we shipped seasonique to our major customers  and in august  duramed s women s healthcare sales force began full scale detailing to healthcare providers 
seasonique has replaced seasonale in the primary sale position among extended cycle oral contraceptives within our women s healthcare sales force 
alliance  development and other revenue alliance  development and other revenue consists mainly of revenue from profit sharing arrangements  co promotion agreements  standby manufacturing fees and reimbursements and fees we receive in conjunction with our agreement with the us department of defense for the development of the adenovirus vaccine 
alliance  development and other revenue increased substantially from the prior year primarily due to our profit sharing 
table of contents arrangement with teva on sales of their generic allegra product and royalty payments and other fees under our agreements with kos on niaspan and advicor 
during fiscal  alliance  development and other revenue totaled million compared to million in the prior year 
the substantial increase was driven by our profit sharing arrangement with teva  which began in september and represented of such revenues in fiscal  and an increase in royalties under our agreements with kos  under which we began earning royalties in the fourth quarter of fiscal teva s day exclusivity period on generic allegra ended on february  by the end of june  there were two additional competing generic allegra products on the market 
we are aware of several other companies that have filed andas with paragraph iv certifications for generic allegra 
competition for generic allegra has and will continue to cause teva s allegra revenues to decrease 
accordingly  our royalties are expected to decline 
additionally  our royalty percentage decreased following the expiration of the exclusivity period on february   further reducing the amount we earn 
as a result of these factors  our royalties from our profit sharing arrangement with teva are expected to decrease substantially over the next twelve months 
royalties we earn under our co promotion agreement with kos are based on the aggregate sales of niaspan and advicor in a given quarter and calendar year  up to quarterly and annual maximum amounts 
while the annual cap increases each year during the term of our arrangement  which ends july  unless extended by either party for an additional year  the royalty rate will decline for calendar  after which the rate remains fixed throughout the remaining term of the agreement 
due to the annual cap for calendar  we expect our royalties earned during the second half of calendar to be lower than in the first half of calendar cost of sales amounts that comprise cost of sales include the cost of products we purchase from third parties  our manufacturing and packaging costs for products we manufacture  profit sharing or royalty payments we make to third parties  including raw material suppliers  changes to our inventory reserves and stock based compensation expense of certain departments that is allocated to cost of sales 
amortization costs arising from the acquisition of product rights and other intangible assets are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
the following table sets forth cost of sales data  in dollars  as well as the resulting gross margins expressed as a percentage of product sales  for fiscal and s in millions change generic products gross margin proprietary products gross margin total cost of sales gross margin overall gross margins for fiscal remained strong at 
cost of sales increased year over year primarily due to the inclusion of million of stock based compensation expense that was not present in fiscal and million of charges to write off the step up to fair value of paragard inventory acquired from fei in november as of june   the entire amount of the step up adjustment had been charged to cost of sales as the units acquired on the date of acquisition have been sold 
margins on our generic products increased slightly in fiscal due to strong sales of desmopressin and didanosine  both of which had higher margins than the average margin of our other generic products 
the margin 
table of contents increase related to these products was slightly offset by the first time inclusion of stock based compensation expense in cost of sales 
we expect that the margins we realize on desmopressin will decline in the future due to the impact of competing products 
this decline may more than offset margins on new generic products we expect to launch  which could result in lower overall margins on our generic products over the next twelve months 
proprietary margins for the year ended june  were negatively impacted by percentage points due primarily to the million inventory step up charge described above  and the inclusion of stock based compensation expense 
we expect gross margins for proprietary products to be above over the next few quarters  in part due to the favorable impact resulting from launches of seasonique and enjuvia somewhat offset by the expected decline in sales of seasonale 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative expense data for fiscal and s in millions change selling  general and administrative charges included in general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to million in higher selling and marketing costs associated with our proprietary product portfolio  largely attributable to the launch of enjuvia during the fourth quarter and personnel costs associated with the additional sales representatives acquired in the fei acquisition  million in stock based compensation that was not included in the prior year  higher information technology costs of million relating to the integration of our sap enterprise resource planning system  a million increase in product intangible amortization expense due to full year amortization on products purchased in the prior year plus amortization of products purchased in the current year  principally paragard and mircette  and a million increase in legal costs  which more than offset the charges described below 
charges included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal and are as follows fiscal on december   after receiving the requisite approvals  we entered into a definitive agreement with organon and savient to acquire the exclusive rights to mircette for million see fiscal charges below 
based on final valuations of the assets acquired  we recorded an additional charge in fiscal of million bringing the total charge to million for the difference between amounts recorded as a probable loss at june  and the final loss amount 
we also incurred transaction costs during fiscal primarily legal and accounting fees of million 
additionally  we received million from a third party as partial reimbursement of the million charge recorded in conjunction with this transaction 
the million reimbursement  together with the additional settlement charge of million and the transactions costs of million  have all been classified as selling  general and administrative expenses and have resulted in a net benefit of million to selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal in february  invamed and apothecon named barr and several others as defendants in lawsuits filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york  alleging violations of antitrust laws and also charging that barr unlawfully blocked access to the raw material source for warfarin sodium 
the two actions were consolidated 
on may   the district court granted summary judgment in barr s favor on all antitrust claims in the case  but found that the plaintiffs could proceed to trial on their allegations that barr interfered with an alleged raw material supply contract between invamed and barr s raw 
table of contents material supplier 
invamed and apothecon appealed the district court s decision to the u 
s 
court of appeals for the second circuit 
on october   the court of appeals reversed the district court s grant of summary judgment and held that the plaintiffs raised issues of material fact on their antitrust claims 
a trial had been scheduled to begin on june  on june   we finalized an agreement that provided a one time payment of million to the plaintiffs 
as a result of the settlement  we recorded a million charge in the quarter ended june  fiscal on june   we entered into a non binding letter of intent loi with organon ireland ltd  organon usa and savient pharmaceuticals  inc to acquire the nda for mircette  obtain an exclusive royalty free license to sell mircette and kariva in the united states and dismiss all pending litigation between the parties in exchange for a payment by us of up to million 
because the transaction included  as one of its components  a payment in settlement of litigation  it was presumed under gaap to give rise to a probable loss  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
based on valuations of the assets we acquired and total estimated payments  we had recorded a charge of million as of june  to reflect the proposed litigation settlement 
research and development the following table sets forth research and development expenses for fiscal and s in millions change research and development the increase in research and development expenses costs was due to an increase of million in costs associated with clinical trials  the inclusion of million of stock based compensation that was not similarly included in fiscal and an increase of million in raw material costs 
these increases were offset by a reimbursement of million for previously incurred costs under a third party development agreement and a million decrease in costs associated with bioequivalent studies supporting our generic product activities 
other income expense the following table sets forth other income for fiscal and s in millions change other income expense other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of a million gain in the value of our foreign currency option related to the proposed pliva acquisition 
this gain was the result of fluctuations and volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro 
we expect additional fluctuations in the value of this option in the future 
additionally  we recorded a net gain during fiscal of million related to our equity investment in two venture funds  compared to a loss of million during fiscal 
table of contents income taxes the following table sets forth income tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate stated as a percentage of pre tax income for fiscal and s in millions change income tax expense effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal was slightly higher than the statutory rate of due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit on december   which was only partially offset by the favorable impact arising from the completion of several tax audits  the change of the mix in income between various taxing jurisdictions and the enactment of favorable tax legislation in certain jurisdictions 
during fiscal the irs completed an audit of our federal income tax return for fiscal the resolution favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal year but did not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
periods prior to fiscal have either been audited or are no longer subject to an irs audit 
we are currently being audited by the irs for fiscal year comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth revenue data for the fiscal years ended june  and s in millions change generic products distributed alternative brands oral contraceptives other generic total generic products proprietary products total product sales alliance  development and other revenue total revenues reflects sales of ciprofloxacin sold during bayer s pediatric exclusivity period which ended on june  includes sales of ciprofloxacin after june  revenues product sales product sales for fiscal decreased for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal due primarily to the decline in sales of ciprofloxacin  as discussed in detail below 
partially offsetting the decrease in ciprofloxacin sales was a increase in sales of our proprietary products 

table of contents generic products distributed alternative brands ciprofloxacin on june  we began distributing ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablets and oral suspension pursuant to a license from bayer corporation obtained under a settlement of a patent challenge we initiated regarding bayer s cipro antibiotic 
in september  we entered into an amended supply agreement with bayer that enabled us to distribute ciprofloxacin during and after bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity  which ended on june  as a result of the exclusivity we enjoyed  ciprofloxacin was our largest selling product in fiscal we have shared and continued to share one half of our profits  as defined  from the sale of ciprofloxacin with sanofi aventis  the contractual successor to our partner in the cipro patent challenge case 
upon expiration of bayer s period of pediatric exclusivity on june   as expected  several other competing ciprofloxacin products were launched 
as a result of the flood of competing products  our market share and product pricing declined dramatically for ciprofloxacin almost immediately 
since the expiration of the exclusivity period  we have included sales of ciprofloxacin in the other generic line item in the table above 
such sales were not significant for fiscal oral contraceptives sales of our generic oral contraceptive products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal price declines and lower volumes resulting from increased competition reduced sales on certain of our products  mainly apri and aviane  and a slowdown in the growth rate of generic substitution more than offset full year contributions from products launched during fiscal  two new products launched in fiscal and market share gains on other existing products 
generic products other sales of other generic products decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as sales from new products  including didanosine and metformin xr mg  were more than offset by declines in other existing product sales 
the decline in other existing product sales was primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of our dextroamphetamine group of products due to both declining volumes and lower prices caused by the launch of competing versions in late in april  our generic exclusivity period on metformin xr mg ended and several other generic companies launched competing versions of the product 
as a result  we experienced a significant decline in sales of metformin xr mg 
proprietary products sales of our proprietary products almost doubled in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
this increase relates primarily to higher sales of seasonale  which totaled million for the fiscal year  reflecting higher unit sales in support of prescription growth and higher pricing compared to the prior fiscal year  full year sales of loestrin loestrin fe and plan b which we acquired in february and march  respectively  and sales of nordette and prefest  which we acquired in november and december  respectively 
seasonale prescriptions  according to ims data  topped  for our fiscal year ended june   a increase over prescriptions in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is a direct result of our significant marketing initiatives  including direct to consumer advertising and the detailing efforts by our women s healthcare sales force 

table of contents cost of sales product mix plays a significant role in our quarterly and annual overall gross margin percentage 
in the past  our overall gross margins have been negatively impacted by sales of lower margin distributed versions of products such as ciprofloxacin and tamoxifen  which were manufactured for us by brand companies and distributed by us under the terms of the respective patent challenge settlement arrangements 
the following table sets forth cost of sales data in dollars as well as the resulting gross margins for fiscal and s in millions change generic products gross margin proprietary products gross margin total cost of sales gross margin the decrease in total cost of sales  on a dollar basis  for fiscal as compared fiscal  was primarily due to the year over year decrease in sales of ciprofloxacin  which in the prior year we had purchased from bayer 
margins on our generic products increased significantly in fiscal due mainly to the decrease in year over year distributed ciprofloxacin sales 
as a distributed product for which we shared the profits with our partner in the cipro patent challenge  ciprofloxacin had a higher cost of sales and a lower margin than our other products 
margins on our proprietary products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased sales of higher margin products  primarily seasonale and loestrin loestrin fe 
selling  general and administrative expense the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative expense data for fiscal and s in millions change selling  general and administrative charges included in general and administrative lower selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to the prior year were primarily due to a decrease in one time charges to sg a partially offset by million in higher marketing costs associated with our proprietary product portfolio and million in higher product intangible amortization expense due to full year amortization on products purchased in the prior year and amortization of products purchased during fiscal 
table of contents charges taken in fiscal that were included in sg a are as follows the charge taken in fiscal is detailed above under the comparison of fiscal years and a million valuation allowance we established in september for our loans to natural biologics  llc  the raw material supplier for our generic equine based conjugated estrogens product  as the result of an unfavorable court decision rendered in september  a million write off in february associated with the acquisition of certain emergency contraception assets from gynetics  inc  an arbitration panel s decision in june to award solvay pharmaceuticals million in damages on its claim that we improperly terminated a joint venture agreement  and an million charge in june related to costs associated with our settlement of the estrostep and femhrt patent challenge litigation with galen 
research and development the following table sets forth research and development expenses for fiscal and s in millions change research and development charges included in research and development for the year ended june  our total research and development costs reflected charges relating to strategic acquisitions or similar activities including a write off of million in march resulting from our agreement to acquire schering s rights and obligations under a product development and license agreement that had been capitalized at the time of our acquisition of enhance pharmaceuticals  inc in june  a write off of million for in process research and development acquired in connection with our acquisition of women s capital corporation in february  and a write off of million of in process research and development costs in connection with our purchase of substantially all of the assets of endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc in november the remaining million increase in research and development for the year ended june  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to million in higher third party development costs  including a million payment to pliva related to the development  supply and marketing agreement that we entered into in march for the generic biopharmaceutical granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf  million in higher bioequivalence study costs  reflecting both an increase in the number and the cost of the studies  million in higher internal production costs in support of internal development projects  and million in higher headcount costs in support of the increased number of products in development 
income taxes the following table sets forth income tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate stated as a percentage of pre tax income for fiscal and s in millions change income tax expense effective tax rate 
table of contents the effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the completion of several tax audits  the change of the mix in income between various taxing jurisdictions and the enactment of favorable tax legislation in certain jurisdictions 
during fiscal the irs completed audits of our federal income tax returns for fiscal and the resolution favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal but did not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources overview the following table highlights selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and s in millions change cash cash equivalents  short term marketable securities working capital cash flow from operations ratio of current assets to current liabilities operating activities our operating cash flow for fiscal was million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in cash flows was due  in part  to the negative impact of recording  in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment  million of tax benefits on option exercises as financing cash flows compared to its treatment as an operating cash flow item in fiscal in addition  our operating cash flows compared to last year were negatively impacted by increases in working capital discussed below 
our primary sources of cash from operations are the collection of accounts and other receivables related to product sales and royalty and other payments from third parties in various ventures  such as teva with respect to generic allegra and kos with respect to niaspan and advicor 
our primary uses of cash include financing inventory  research and development programs  marketing and selling  capital projects and investing in business development activities 
over the last three fiscal years  our cash flows from operations have been more than sufficient to fund our operations  capital expenditures and business development activities 
as a result  our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances have increased over that time 
investment in marketable securities our investments in marketable securities provide a greater return on our cash balances compared to leaving them in bank accounts 
our investments in marketable securities are governed by our investment policy  which seeks to optimize returns while preserving capital  maintaining adequate liquidity and investing in tax advantaged securities  as appropriate 

table of contents working capital working capital as of june  and consisted of the following s in millions change cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable other receivables inventories prepaid other current assets total current assets accounts payable accrued liabilities income taxes payable current portion of long term debt capital leases total current liabilities working capital working capital increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and other receivables on higher product sales and alliance revenues during fiscal in addition  prepaid and other current assets increased reflecting our purchase of a foreign currency hedge in connection with our proposed pliva acquisition 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities largely as a result of the payment  in december  of million to resolve the mircette litigation that was accrued as of june  investing activities our net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of fei women s health  llc and the mircette product rights for a total of million  along with the purchase of a million derivative instrument in connection with our proposed pliva acquisition 
capital expenditures during the three fiscal years ended june   we have invested approximately million in upgrades and expansions to our property  plant and equipment as well as technology investments  including the purchase and implementation of a new sap enterprise resource planning erp system 
the investment in property  plant and equipment has significantly expanded our production  laboratory  warehouse and distribution capacity in our facilities and was designed to help ensure that we have the facilities necessary to manufacture  test  package and distribute our current and future products 
our investment in the erp system will help ensure that we have a platform to grow our business  including better integration of acquired businesses  expansion into new drug delivery systems and the ability to expand internationally 
during fiscal  we invested million in capital projects and expect that our capital investments will be between million and million over the next twelve months 
our estimate reflects continued spending on our facility expansion programs and investments in information technology projects including additional investments in support of our new erp system 
we believe we can continue funding our capital requirements using cash provided by operations 

table of contents strategic transactions our investments in strategic acquisitions were million in fiscal as discussed above and approximately million for the three years ended june  we continuously evaluate strategic transactions to further improve our business and long range prospects and may make additional investments or acquisitions over the next twelve months  including the proposed acquisition of pliva 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal the increase compared to the prior year is primarily due to classifying million of tax benefits relating to our stock incentives as financing activities as compared to classifying them as part of operating cash flows in fiscal  and to the million funding of share repurchases under our share repurchase program in fiscal  there were no such share repurchases under this program in fiscal share repurchase program in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  pursuant to terms we deem appropriate and at such times as we designate through the end of december in november  our board of directors extended the repurchase period through the end of december we hold repurchased shares as treasury shares and may use them for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal debt repayments and credit availability debt balances decreased by approximately million from june  to june  reflecting principal repayments 
in february  we made a million payment in complete satisfaction of mortgage notes held by a bank 
the notes were secured by our cincinnati  ohio manufacturing facility 
principal repayments on existing debt will be million over the next twelve months 
on july   in anticipation of the funding required to consummate our tender offer for pliva  we entered into an unsecured senior credit facility the credit facility pursuant to which lenders will provide us with an aggregate amount not to exceed billion 
of this amount  billion is in the form of a five year term facility  million is in the form of a day term facility combined  the term facilities  and million is in the form of a five year revolving credit facility 
the billion of term facilities  which bear interest at libor plus basis points  may be drawn only in connection with  if consummated  our proposed pliva acquisition 
the million revolving credit facility replaces our prior million revolving credit facility  which we terminated on july   and may be used for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility includes customary covenants for agreements of this kind  including financial covenants limiting our total indebtedness on a consolidated basis 
in july  a letter of credit totaling approximately billion was issued on our behalf under the credit facility 
the letter of credit  which is being used to support our tender offer  is subject to fees totaling per annum for such time as it remains outstanding 
proceeds from equity transactions during fiscal  we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options and share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we expect proceeds from future stock option exercises to decline over time  due in part  to our decision to issue employees stock appreciation rights sars  rather than stock options 
upon exercise of a stock option the company receives proceeds equal to the grant price per share for each option exercised 
in contrast  the company will not receive 
table of contents cash proceeds when a sar is exercised because the employee receives a net number of shares 
while the company will continue to receive proceeds from any remaining options that are exercised  the amount of such proceeds is difficult to predict because the proceeds are highly dependent upon our stock price  which can be volatile 
sufficiency of cash resources we believe our current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investment balances  cash flows from operations and un drawn amounts under our new credit facilities are adequate to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures  the contemplated pliva acquisition  and to capitalize on strategic opportunities as they arise 
we have and will continue to evaluate our capital structure as part of our goal to promote long term shareholder value 
to the extent that additional capital resources are required  or if new or existing debt needs to be refinanced  we believe that such capital may be raised by additional bank borrowings  debt offerings or other means 
contractual obligations payments due by period for our contractual obligations at june  are as follows s in millions payments due by period less than in millions total year to years to years thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations venture funds commitments annual interest on fixed rate debt other long term liabilities total purchase obligations consist mainly of commitments for raw materials used in our manufacturing and research and development operations 
payments related to our venture fund commitments are payable when capital calls are made 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are expected to have  an effect on our financial statements  other than the letter of credit totaling approximately billion in support of our tender offer to acquire pliva  as discussed above 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying the accounting policies most critical to our financial statements have a significant impact on our reported results 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and or require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  our most critical policies are the following revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross product sales  revenue recognition and provisions of alliance  development and other revenue  inventories and inventory reserves  income taxes  contingencies  and acquisitions and amortization of intangible assets 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time the estimates and assumptions were made 
we review the factors that influence our estimates and  if necessary  adjust them 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross product sales we recognize revenue from product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to our customers and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customer 
from time to time the company provides incentives  such as trade show allowances or stocking allowances  that provide incremental allowances to customers who in turn use such incremental allowances to accelerate distribution to the end customer 
we believe that such incentives are normal and customary in the industry 
additionally  we understand that certain of our wholesale customers anticipate the timing of price increases and have made and may continue to make business decisions to buy additional product in anticipation of future price increases 
this practice has been customary in the industry and would be part of a customer s ordinary course of business inventory level 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesale customers  which account for approximately of our sales  through an internal analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler contract sales  available end consumer prescription information and inventory data from our largest wholesale customer 
we believe that our evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels as described in the preceding sentence  allows us to make reasonable estimates for our applicable reserves 
further  our products are typically sold with sufficient dating to permit sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell our products in their inventory through to the end consumer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  we simultaneously record estimates for the following items that reduce gross revenues returns and allowances including shelf stock adjustments chargebacks rebates managed care rebates medicaid rebates prompt payment discounts and other allowances for each of the items listed above other than managed care and medicaid rebates  the estimated amounts serve to reduce our accounts receivable balance 
we include our estimate for managed care and medicaid rebates in accrued liabilities 
a table showing the activity of each reserve  based on these estimates  is set forth below s in millions current provision current provision actual returns related to sales related to sales or credits beginning made in the made in in the ending balance current period prior periods current period balance fiscal year ended june  accounts receivable reserves returns and allowances chargebacks rebates cash discounts total accrued liabilities managed care rebates medicaid rebates fiscal year ended june  accounts receivable reserves returns and allowances chargebacks rebates cash discounts total accrued liabilities managed care rebates medicaid rebates 
table of contents returns and allowances our provision for returns and allowances consists of our estimates of future product returns  pricing adjustments  delivery errors  and our estimate of price adjustments arising from shelf stock adjustments which are discussed in greater detail below 
consistent with industry practice  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period of time both prior and subsequent to the product s expiration date 
the primary factors we consider in estimating our potential product returns include the shelf life or expiration date of each product  historical levels of expired product returns  and the estimated date of return 
shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to our customers to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products 
these credits are customary in the industry and are intended to reduce a customer s inventory cost to better reflect current market prices 
the determination to grant a shelf stock credit to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion rather than contractually required 
the primary factors we consider when deciding whether to record a reserve for a shelf stock adjustment include the estimated launch date of a competing product  which we determine based on market intelligence  the estimated decline in the market price of our product  which we determine based on historical experience and input from customers  and  the estimated levels of inventory held by our customers at the time of the anticipated decrease in market price  which we determine based upon historical experience and customer input 
chargebacks we market and sell products directly to wholesalers  distributors  warehousing pharmacy chains  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasing groups 
we also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies  non warehousing chains  managed care organizations  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products 
these indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices 
alternatively  we may pre authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers 
under either arrangement  we provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
such credit is called a chargeback 
the primary factors we consider in developing and evaluating our provision for chargebacks include the average historical chargeback credits  and an estimate of the inventory held by our wholesalers  based on internal analysis of a wholesaler s historical purchases and contract sales 
rebates our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following four types direct rebates  indirect rebates  managed care rebates  and medicaid rebates 
the direct and indirect rebates relate primarily to the generic segment of our business whereas our managed care rebates are solely associated with the proprietary segment of our business 
medicaid rebates apply to both of our segments 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a percentage applied to a direct customer s purchases from us 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers which have purchased barr products from a wholesaler under a contract with us 
managed care and medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector medicaid benefit providers  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
we maintain reserves for our direct rebate programs based on purchases by our direct purchasing customers 
indirect rebate reserves are based on actual contract purchases in a period and an estimate of wholesaler inventory subject to an indirect rebate 
managed care and medicaid reserves are based on expected payments  which are driven 
table of contents by patient usage  contract performance  as well as field inventory that will be subject to a managed care or medicaid rebate 
prompt pay discounts we offer many of our customers prompt pay discounts 
we evaluate the amounts accrued for prompt pay discounts by analyzing the unpaid invoices in our accounts receivable aging subject to a prompt pay discount 
revenue recognition and provisions of alliance  development and other revenue we have agreements with certain pharmaceutical companies under which we receive payments based on sales or profits associated with the applicable products 
our two most significant of these agreements are those with teva regarding generic allegra and with kos pharmaceuticals regarding niaspan and advicor 
revenue from these agreements is recognized at the time title and risk of loss pass to a third party and is based on pre defined formulas contained in our agreements  as adjusted for our estimates of reserves needed to state our revenues on a basis consistent with our other revenue recognition policies 
the estimates we make to adjust our revenues are based on information received from our partner  whether teva or kos  as well as our own internal information 
selling and marketing expenses we incur under our co promotion agreement with kos are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
inventories and inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of finished goods purchased from third party manufacturers and held for distribution  as well as raw materials  work in process and finished goods manufactured by us 
we determine cost on a first in  first out basis 
we capitalize the costs associated with certain products prior to receiving final marketing approval from the fda for such products pre launch inventories 
for our generic products  each anda submission is made with the expectation that i the fda will approve the marketing of the applicable product  ii we will validate our process for manufacturing the applicable product within the specifications that have been or will be approved by the fda  and iii the cost of the inventory will be recovered from the commercialization of our anda product 
typically  we capitalize inventory related to our proprietary products based on the same expectations as above  but we do not begin to capitalize costs until the nda is filed or in the case of components to a nda product  the product development process has progressed to a point where we have determined that the product has a high probability of regulatory approval 
the accumulation of pre launch inventory involves risks such as i the fda may not approve such product s for marketing on a timely basis  if ever  ii approvals may require additional or different testing and or specifications than what was performed in the manufacture of such pre launch inventory  and iii in those instances where the pre launch inventory is for a product that is subject to litigation  the litigation may not be resolved or settled to our satisfaction 
if any of these risks were to materialize and the launch of such product were significantly delayed  we may have to write off all or a portion of such pre launch inventory and such amounts could be material 
as of june  and  the amount of pre launch inventory was not material to our net earnings 
we establish reserves for our inventory  including pre launch inventory  to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we review our inventory for products that are close to or have reached their expiration date and therefore are not expected to be sold  for products where market conditions have changed or are expected to change  and for products that are not expected to be saleable based on our quality assurance and control standards 
in addition  for our pre launch inventory  we take into consideration the substance of communications with the fda during the approval process and the views of patent and litigation counsel 
the reserves we establish in these situations is equal to all or a portion of the cost of the inventory based on the specific facts and circumstances 
in evaluating whether inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider such factors as the amount of product inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we record provisions for inventory obsolescence as part of cost of sales 
inventories are presented net of reserves of million at june  and million at june  
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and available tax incentives ie credits and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions may be challenged and may not be upheld on audit 
we adjust our reserves upon the occurrence of a discrete event  such as the completion of an income tax audit 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and charges to reserves that are considered appropriate 
this rate is applied to our quarterly operating results 
tax regulations require certain items to be included in the income tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the income tax return 
some of the differences are permanent  such as tax exempt interest income  and some are timing differences such as depreciation expense 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return  but have not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements 
contingencies we are involved in various patent  product liability  commercial litigation and claims  government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
we assess  in consultation with counsel  the need to accrue a liability for such contingencies and record a reserve when we determine that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable  our assessment can involve judgments about future events 
we record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when collection is reasonably assured 
we utilize a combination of self insurance and traditional third party insurance policies to cover potential product liability claims on products sold on or after september   and we have obtained extended reporting periods under previous policies for claims arising on products sold prior to september  acquisitions and amortization of intangible assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition and are not restated 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized based on sales over the expected life of the asset 
amortization expense is included in the selling  general and administrative expense line item of the statement of operations 
when we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business  no goodwill is recognized 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  which considers various characteristics of the asset  including projected cash flows 
we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 

table of contents as a result of our acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill of million on our balance sheets as of june  and million as of june  in addition  as a result of our acquisition of product rights and related intangibles and certain product licenses  we have recorded million and million as other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  on our balance sheets as of june  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and amends sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in their income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and directors 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r on july  this statement requires that compensation expense for most equity based awards be recognized over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  while compensation expense for liability based awards those usually settled in cash rather than stock be re measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled 
we use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock based compensation granted to employees and directors and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model in the future 
because sfas no 
r must be applied not only to new awards  but also to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  compensation cost for the unvested portion of some previously granted options are recognized under sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas r 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas  shall be recognized in net earnings in the periods after the date of adoption 
based on the adoption of the modified prospective method  the company recorded a pre tax stock based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal this amount represents previously issued awards vesting in fiscal and fiscal year awards that were granted 
in march  the fasb published interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption of this interpretation during the second quarter of fiscal year did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fasb and fasb  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp provides guidance on determining if an investment is considered to be impaired  if the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this fsp did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of the interpretation 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements 
environmental matters we may have obligations for environmental safety and clean up under various state  local and federal laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund 
based on information currently available  environmental expenditures have not had  and are not anticipated to have  any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation  seasonality inflation has had only a minimal impact on our operations in recent years 
similarly  our business is generally not affected by seasonality 
forward looking statements the preceding sections contain a number of forward looking statements 
to the extent that any statements made in this report contain information that is not historical  these statements are essentially forward looking 
forward looking statements can be identified by their use of words such as expects  plans  will  may  anticipates  believes  should  intends  estimates and other words of similar meaning 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified and  consequently  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  in no particular order the difficulty in predicting the timing and outcome of legal proceedings  including patent related matters such as patent challenge settlements and patent infringement cases  the difficulty of predicting the timing of fda approvals  court and fda decisions on exclusivity periods  the ability of competitors to extend exclusivity periods for their products  our ability to complete product development activities in the timeframes and for the costs we expect  market and customer acceptance and demand for our pharmaceutical products  our dependence on revenues from significant customers  reimbursement policies of third party payors  our dependence on revenues from significant products  the use of estimates in the preparation of our financial statements  the impact of competitive products and pricing on products  including the launch of authorized generics  the ability to launch new products in the timeframes we expect  the availability of raw materials  the availability of any product we purchase and sell as a distributor  the regulatory environment  our exposure to product liability and other lawsuits and contingencies  the cost of insurance and the availability of product liability insurance coverage  our timely and successful completion of strategic initiatives  including integrating companies and products we acquire and implementing our new enterprise resource planning system  fluctuations in operating results  including the effects on such results from spending for research and development  sales and marketing activities and patent challenge activities  and 
table of contents other risks detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we wish to caution each reader of this report to consider carefully these factors as well as specific factors that may be discussed with each forward looking statement in this report or disclosed in our filings with the sec  as such factors  in some cases  could affect our ability to implement our business strategies and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed herein 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider these factors 
we undertake no duty to update the forward looking statements even though our situation may change in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of approximately million 
we do not use  nor have we historically used  derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents and market auction debt securities primarily classified as available for sale 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio in a variety of high credit quality debt securities  including us  state and local government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
over of our portfolio matures in less than three months  or is subject to an interest rate reset date that occurs within days 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates the market value at june  and the value at maturity 
because our investments consist of cash equivalents and market auction debt securities  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on june   we entered into a foreign exchange option for a notional amount equal to billion to protect the value of our us dollar investment in the proposed foreign currency denominated acquisition of pliva 
the foreign exchange option gives us the right  but not the obligation  to purchase euro at the agreed upon strike price 
the value of the foreign exchange contract fluctuates depending on the value of the us dollar compared to the euro 
at june   for every one percent change in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro  the value of the foreign exchange contract will fluctuate by approximately million 
on june   the mark to market value of our foreign exchange option resulted in a gain of million 
we expect the foreign exchange option to be settled concurrent with our payment of the purchase price for pliva upon closing of the acquisition  which  if successful  is expected to occur in october or november  none of our outstanding debt at june  bears interest at a variable rate
