the table below sets forth the company s primary business segments results of operations in thousands for the years ended december  bfc activities financial services homebuilding real estate development eliminations noncontrolling interest income from continuing operations discontinued operations  less applicable income taxes net income critical accounting policies management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the statement of operations for the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  evaluation of goodwill for impairment  the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans  the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities in the application of the purchase method of accounting  the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the valuation of real estate held for development and equity method investments and accounting for contingencies 
the seven accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting policies are i allowance for loan losses  ii valuation of securities as well as the determination of other than temporary declines in value  iii impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  iv impairment of long lived assets  v the valuation of real estate held for development and sale and equity method investments  vi accounting for business combinations  and vii accounting for contingencies

table of contents bfc activities since bfc s principal activities consist of managing existing investments and actively seeking and evaluating potential new investments  bfc itself has no significant direct revenue or cash generating operations 
we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries for a significant portion of our cash flow 
regulatory restrictions and the terms of indebtedness limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends by each of bankatlantic bancorp and levitt also are subject to a number of conditions  including cash flow and profitability  declaration by each company s board of directors  compliance with the terms of each company s outstanding indebtedness  and in the case of bankatlantic bancorp  regulatory restrictions applicable to bankatlantic 
bankatlantic bancorp s and levitt s boards of directors are comprised of individuals  a majority of whom are independent 
the bfc activities segment includes bfc s loans receivable that relate to previously owned properties  investment in benihana s convertible preferred stock  other securities and investments  bfc s overhead and interest expense and the financial results of venture partnerships which bfc controls 
accordingly  bfc itself  as a holding company and the bfc activities segment will normally show a loss as dividends  interest and fees from our investments typically do not cover bfc stand alone operating costs

table of contents bfc impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  except as otherwise noted and in those instances reconciled to the generally accepted accounting treatment of the financial measurement under discussion  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature by virtue of our ownership in bankatlantic bancorp 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general price levels 
although interest rates generally move in the same direction as inflation  the magnitude of such changes varies 
the possible effect of fluctuating interest rates is discussed more fully under the section entitled consolidated interest rate risk in item a below 
with respect to our real estate activities  primarily the activities of our subsidiary levitt  inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs may reduce gross margins 
in recent years  the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and historically have not had a significant adverse impact on us 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations

bankatlantic continues to implement marketing programs in its stores that include sales training programs  outbound telemarketing and incentive programs that reward banking personnel who produce profitable business 

table of contents since inception of this campaign  bankatlantic has increased its balances in demand deposit  now checking and savings accounts low cost deposits from million at december  to approximately billion at december  these low cost deposits represented of bankatlantic s total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  the growth in these low cost deposits was the primary reason for the improvement in bankatlantic s net interest margin and the significant increase in its non interest income 
bankatlantic s net interest margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period and its non interest income was million during compared to million during subject to changes in the interest rate environment  bankatlantic expects its net interest income to continue to improve during in response to the relatively flat interest rate yield curve during the latter half of  bankatlantic implemented a strategy to improve its net interest margin by limiting earning asset growth and utilizing the funds obtained from low cost deposit growth to pay down higher rate borrowings 
as the interest rate yield curve remains flat to inverted  management anticipates maintaining this strategy into during  bankatlantic made major modifications to its underwriting process and changes to its credit policies focusing its loan production on collateral based loans 
as a consequence  bankatlantic s credit quality ratios continued to improve during total non performing assets declined to million at december  compared to million at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans declined to at december  from at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared to at december  bankatlantic continued to experience net recoveries from loans charged off in prior periods of million during compared to million during and net charge offs of million during bankatlantic does not expect the net recoveries to remain at and levels during subsequent periods 
the improvements in bankatlantic s net interest income  non interest income and credit quality ratios were partially offset by a significant increase in non interest expenses associated with additional employees necessary to service the new low cost deposit accounts and to comply with banking and securities regulations  higher occupancy costs associated with expanding the branch network and renovating existing branches  and significant increases in advertising and marketing expenses 
during the second and third quarter of  bankatlantic experienced a decline in low cost deposit growth

bankatlantic also incurred other expenses during associated with establishing a million reserve for fines and penalties related to regulatory compliance matters and incurring a million impairment charge 
based on past deficiencies identified in bankatlantic s aml bsa compliance  bankatlantic determined that it was appropriate to establish a million reserve with respect to these matters

b average balances were based on amortized cost 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period the substantial improvement in tax equivalent net interest income primarily resulted from higher average interest earning asset balances and a basis point improvement in the net interest margin 
bankatlantic s average interest earning asset balances increased primarily due to purchases of residential loans and tax exempt securities as well as the origination of small business and home equity loans 
during  bankatlantic purchased over million of residential loans and originated million of small business and home equity loans 
these additional average earning asset balances resulted in an increase of million in interest income 
the growth in its interest earning assets was funded through deposit growth  short term borrowings and libor based short term fhlb advances 
these additional interest bearing liability balances resulted in an increase in interest expense of million 
during the second half of  the growth in average earning assets slowed in response to the flattening of the interest rate yield curve 
bankatlantic intends to continue this strategy of limiting earning asset growth in a flat or inverted yield curve environment 
the improvement in our tax equivalent net interest margin primarily resulted from a substantial increase in low cost deposits  and secondarily  from higher earning asset yields 
low cost deposits are savings  now and demand deposits and these deposits were of total average deposits during compared to during bankatlantic experienced increases in both interest earning asset and interest bearing liability yields and rates 
since june  the prime interest rate has increased from to 
this increase has favorably impacted the yields on earning assets  which was offset by higher rates on our short term borrowings  certificate 
table of contents accounts  money market deposits  libor based fhlb advances and long term debt 
as a consequence  bankatlantic s interest rate spread only increased slightly from bankatlantic increased its holdings of tax exempt securities during and as the after tax yields were more attractive than alternative investments 
capitalized interest represents interest capitalized on qualifying assets associated with the riverclub real estate joint venture acquired as part of a financial institution acquisition 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period the improvement in bankatlantic s tax equivalent net interest margin primarily resulted from a significant decrease in interest expense which was the result of the prepayment of certain high rate fhlb advances and in the increased percentage of low cost deposits 
the repayment of these fhlb advances and the termination of a related interest rate swap resulted in an million loss included in non interest expense 
during the year ended december   approximately million  or of average interest bearing liabilities  consisted of advances from the fhlb with an average rate of versus an average rate of during low cost deposits represented of total average deposits during compared to during partially offsetting the decreases in interest expense on advances and deposits were increases in interest expense on short term borrowings 
although average balances were slightly lower  the average rate on these borrowings was higher  reflecting the higher short term interest rate environment 
interest income on average loans increased slightly as the small decline in average loan yields was offset by an increase in average loan balances 
the growth in balances primarily resulted from the origination of commercial real estate and home equity consumer loans 
during  bankatlantic originated over billion of corporate and commercial loans and over million of home equity loans 
beginning in july the prime rate of interest increased from to at december   while long term loan rates declined slightly from the december levels 
the increase in short term interest rates contributed to average loan yields only declining slightly from the prior period 
tax equivalent interest income on investment securities declined million  primarily due to a decline in the average balance of the investment portfolio 
maturities and prepayments on us agency obligations  primarily mortgage backed securities  were only partially replaced by purchases of new agency securities and purchases of tax exempt securities

table of contents as of december  allocation allocation amount of all amount of all lease finance syndication loans small business consumer indirect small business loans originated before january  during prior periods we discontinued the origination of syndication  lease financings and indirect consumer loans and made major modifications to the underwriting process for small business loans collectively  discontinued loan products 
the loans associated with the discontinued loan products gave rise to a significant portion of our net charge offs during each of the years in the two year period ended december  the decline in those portfolios during the past five years has contributed to the reduction of our allowance for loan losses 
additionally  we were able to realize net recoveries associated with previously charged off loans during each of the years in the three year period ended december  which favorably impacted our provision for loan losses 
the remaining loans in discontinued loan products mature during the year ended december  and management believes that these loans will not have any material impact on the provision in subsequent periods 
the recovery from loan losses improved in each of the years in the three year period ended december  this improvement resulted from several factors  including the discontinuation of the loan products mentioned above and changes in our credit policies which focused our loan production on collateral based loans with lower loss experiences than our other loan products 
the discontinued loan products accounted for approximately of our net charge offs in the past five years 
during the past three years balances of  and losses in  discontinued loan products declined  while we experienced substantially lower losses from loans originated under our new credit policies 
as a consequence  during  our loan provision was a recovery due to significant recoveries from our discontinued loan products 
the majority of these recoveries were from bankruptcy settlements associated with syndication loans charged off in prior periods 
in  our provision for loan losses was a recovery primarily as a consequence of a million recovery of a commercial real estate loan that was charged off in  as well as continued net recoveries from our discontinued loan products 
during  our provision was a recovery due to decreased reserves associated with the commercial loan portfolio reflecting lower loan balances and a payoff of a large hotel loan 
loans to borrowers in the hospitality industry are allocated higher general reserves than other categories of loans in the portfolio 
we also experienced a reduction in our classified loans during the year which further added to our recovery from loan losses 
bankatlantic s total charge offs from continuing loan products during consisted primarily of various charge offs related to small business  residential and home equity loans

this industry was designated to have higher credit risk than loans in our portfolio to borrowers in other industries 
the decline in the assigned allowance for commercial real estate loans at december  was associated with repayments of loans in the hospitality industry  lower classified loan balances and a decline in portfolio balances 

table of contents at december   our commercial real estate portfolio included several large lending relationships  including relationships with unaffiliated borrowers involving individual lending commitments in excess of million with an aggregate outstanding amount of million 
the assigned allowance for consumer direct loans has increased for each of the years in the five year period ended december  this increase resulted from the growth in outstanding home equity loans throughout the period 
the significant increase in the assigned allowance for home equity loans during compared to reflects an increase in the home equity loan loss ratio 
this ratio was increased in response to an analysis of the portfolio which included a review of the portfolios loan to value ratios 
the analysis revealed that probable inherent losses in the home equity loan portfolio were greater than the historical loss experience as a result of the significant increase in borrower monthly payments in connection with their adjustable rate first mortgages  the substantial increase in the amount of interest only first mortgage loans being offered in the market such loans being senior to the bank s second mortgage  and the increase in short term interest rates from june the change in the percentage of allowance for loan losses to total gross loans during the three year period ended december  primarily reflects changes in classified assets  except for the adjustment in the consumer direct loss ratio mentioned above 
the unassigned portion of the allowance for loan losses addresses certain individual industry conditions  general economic conditions and geographic concentration 
the unassigned allowance increased in each of the years in the four year period ended december  and remained at the prior year level at december  the major factors contributing to the increase in our unassigned allowance for loan losses during the four year period ending december  were the expanded geographical area in which we originate commercial real estate loans  and the growth in our consumer and purchased residential loan portfolios 
we opened commercial loan offices in orlando and jacksonville  florida 
the loans originated outside our primary markets may have substantially different loss experiences than loans secured by collateral in south florida 
loans originated in commercial lending branch offices outside of south florida amounted to million at december  and million at december  also contributing to our increase in the unassigned portion of the allowance was the growth in our purchased residential and home equity loan products 
many of the purchased residential loans were hybrid loans with interest only payments for a period of three to ten years  followed by conversion to a fully amortizing loan at the then prevailing interest rates for the remaining term of the loan 
these types of delayed amortizing loans may have a greater default or recovery risk than existing traditional amortizing loans in our portfolio 
during  we modified our underwriting policies to allow for higher loan to value ratios based on beacon scores for home equity loans  and we originated approximately million and million of home equity loans during and  respectively  primarily in our south florida market 
during  the unassigned portion of the allowance remained at the prior period amount as there were no significant changes in lending policies or geographical concentration of credit risk

table of contents non performing assets have significantly declined in each of the years in the five year period ended december  we attribute this reduction in non performing assets to the strengthening of bankatlantic s underwriting policies by focusing our loan production on collateral based loans as well as discontinuing the origination of loan products with high historical loss experiences 
in  the improvement in non performing assets resulted from the foreclosure and sale of a large consumer home equity loan and the decline in bankatlantic s lease financing portfolio 
this improvement was partially offset by an increase in non performing residential loans and higher real estate owned 
the increase in real estate owned primarily relates to bankatlantic s tax certificate operations 
during and  these acquired properties were sold for amounts in excess of their carrying value 
in  non accrual assets improved from due primarily to lower amounts of residential non performing loans  delinquent tax certificates and real estate owned balances in our portfolio  resulting from favorable economic conditions in the real estate industry 
the improvement in non performing assets was partially offset by higher non accrual lease financing lending arrangements in the aviation industry and higher non accruing home equity loans 
non performing asset amounts during and were primarily associated with discontinued loan products

during and  the buyer made million and million  respectively  of principal repayments of the promissory note  which reduced the balance to million at december  in the ordinary course of business  ryan beck borrows  under an agreement with its clearing broker  by pledging securities owned as collateral primarily to finance its trading inventories 
the amount and terms of the borrowings are subject to the lending policies of the clearing broker and can be changed at the clearing broker s discretion 
additionally  the amount financed is also impacted by the market value of the securities owned 
ryan beck is subject to the net capital provision of rule c under the securities exchange act of  which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and requires the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital  both as defined  not to exceed to additionally  ryan beck  as a market maker  is subject to supplemental requirements of rule c a  which provides for the computation of net capital to be based on the number of and price of issues in which markets are made by ryan beck  not to exceed million 
ryan beck s regulatory net capital was million  which was million in excess of its required net capital of million at december  ryan beck operates under the provisions of paragraph k ii of rule c of the securities and exchange commission as a fully disclosed introducing broker and  accordingly  customer accounts are carried on the books of the clearing broker 
however  ryan beck safekeeps and redeems municipal bond coupons for the benefit of its customers 
accordingly  ryan beck is subject to the provisions of sec rule c relating to possession or control and customer reserve requirements and was in compliance with such provisions at december  consolidated cash flows a summary of our consolidated cash flows follows in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities declined during compared to due primarily to lower net income 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities increased significantly primarily resulting from net repayments of loans receivable during compared to net originations of loans receivable during as well as lower securities purchased during compared to cash flows from financing activities declined substantially during primarily due to repayment of fhlb advances as compared to the fhlb advances were repaid primarily from loan repayments 
cash flows from operating activities declined during compared to due primarily to a decrease in ryan beck s clearing agent liability and the reduction in cash flows attributable to levitt s operations due to the december  spin off 
the above declines in cash flows were partially offset by a substantial decrease in real estate inventory as a result of the levitt spin off 
cash flows from investing activities decreased during compared to due to a substantial increase in loan purchases and originations and securities purchases 
cash flows from financing activities increased during compared to resulting primarily from additional fhlb advance and short term borrowings used to fund loan and securities purchases 
also contributing to the increase in cash flows from financing activities was a substantial increase in low cost deposits 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and loan commitments the table below summarizes the company s loan commitments at december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than after commercial commitments committed year years years years lines of credit standby letters of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments lines of credit are primarily revolving lines to home equity loan and business loan customers 
the business loans to customers usually expire in less than one year and the home equity lines generally expire in years 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by bankatlantic to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
bankatlantic standby letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the construction industry guaranteeing project performance 
these types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of million at december  bankatlantic also issues standby letters of credit to commercial lending customers guaranteeing the payment of goods and services 
these types of standby letters of credit had a maximum exposure of million at december  those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements and have maturities of one year or less 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
bankatlantic may hold certificates of deposit and residential and commercial liens as collateral for such commitments  similar to other types of borrowings 
loan commitments are agreements to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
bankatlantic evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral required by bankatlantic in connection with an extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 

table of contents at december   the company did not have off balance sheet arrangements that would have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the table below summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years time deposits long term debt advances from fhlb operating lease obligations pension obligation other obligations securities sold but not yet purchased total contractual cash obligations payments due by period are based on contractual maturities the above table excludes interest payments on interest bearing liabilities long term debt primarily consists of the junior subordinated debentures issued by the company as well as bankatlantic s subordinated debentures  secured borrowings and mortgage backed bonds 
operating lease obligations represent minimum future lease payments in which the company is the lessee for real estate and equipment leases 
securities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of ryan beck to deliver specified financial instruments at contracted prices  thereby creating a liability to purchase the financial instrument in the market at prevailing prices 
the pension obligation represents the accumulated benefit obligation of the company s defined benefit plan at december  the payments represent the estimated benefit payments through  of which the majority of the payments will be funded through plan assets 
the table does not include estimated benefit payments after the actuarial present value of the projected accumulated benefit obligation was million at december  the other obligations are legally binding agreements with vendors for the purchase of services  land and materials associated with the expansion and renovation of bankatlantic s branches as well as advertising  marketing and sponsorship contracts 
during the years ended december  and  actions were taken by levitt with respect to the development of the property which was formerly bankatlantic s headquarters 
levitt s efforts included the successful rezoning of the property and obtaining the permits necessary to develop the property for residential and commercial use 
at december   bankatlantic had agreed to reimburse levitt  for the costs incurred by it in connection with the development of this project 
levitt has also sought as additional compensation from bankatlantic a percentage of the increase in the value of the underlying property attributable to levitt s efforts based upon the proceeds to be received from bankatlantic on the sale of the property to a third party 
the timing and amount of such additional compensation  if any  has not yet been agreed upon 
ryan beck s customers securities transactions are introduced on a fully disclosed basis to its clearing broker 
the clearing broker carries all of the accounts of the customers of ryan beck and is responsible for execution  collection and payment of funds  and receipt and delivery of securities relative to customer transactions 
customers securities activities are transacted on a cash and margin basis 
these transactions may expose ryan beck to off balance sheet risk  wherein the clearing broker may charge ryan beck for any losses it incurs in the 
table of contents event that customers may be unable to fulfill their contractual commitments and margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses 
as the right to charge ryan beck has no maximum amount and applies to all trades executed through the clearing broker  ryan beck believes there is no maximum amount assignable to this right 
at december   ryan beck recorded liabilities of approximately  with regard to this right 
ryan beck has the right to pursue collection or performance from the counter parties who do not perform under their contractual obligations 
ryan beck seeks to minimize this risk through procedures designed to monitor the creditworthiness of its customers and ensure that customer transactions are executed properly by the clearing broker 
ryan beck enters into various transactions involving derivatives and other off balance sheet financial instruments 
these financial instruments include futures  mortgage backed to be announced securities tbas and securities purchased and sold on a when issued basis when issued securities 
these derivative financial instruments are used to meet the needs of customers  conduct trading activities  and manage market risks and are  therefore  subject to varying degrees of market and credit risk 
derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes or to economically hedge other positions or transactions 
ryan beck enters into futures contracts and tbas and when issued securities  all of which provide for the delayed delivery of the underlying instrument 
futures contracts are executed on an exchange  and cash settlement is made on a daily basis for market movements 
accordingly  futures contracts generally do not have credit risk 
the credit risk for tbas  options and when issued securities is limited to the unrealized market valuation gains recorded in the statement of financial condition 
market risk is substantially dependent upon the value of the underlying financial instruments and is affected by market forces such as volatility and changes in interest rates 
ryan beck  in its capacity as a market maker and dealer in corporate and municipal fixed income and equity securities  may enter into transactions in a variety of cash and derivative financial instruments in order to facilitate customer order flow and hedge market risk exposures 
these financial instruments include securities sold  but not yet purchased and future contracts 
securities sold  but not yet purchased represent obligations of the company to deliver specified financial instruments at contracted prices  thereby creating a liability to purchase the financial instrument in the market at prevailing prices 
accordingly  these transactions result in off balance sheet risk as the company s ultimate obligation may exceed the amount recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
ryan beck is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which counterparties primarily include broker dealers  banks  and other financial institutions 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
it is ryan beck s policy to review  as necessary  the credit standing of each counterparty 
critical accounting policies management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the consolidated statement of operations for the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment  the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans  the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities in the application of the purchase method of accounting  the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  accounting for contingencies  and assumptions used in the pro forma note disclosure for stock based compensation 
the six accounting policies that we have identified as critical accounting policies are i allowance for loan losses  ii valuation of securities as well as the determination of other than temporary declines in value  iii impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets  iv impairment of long lived assets  v accounting for business combinations and vi accounting for contingencies 
we have discussed the critical accounting estimates outlined below with our audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 
see 
table of contents note  summary of significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount we consider adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we have developed policies and procedures for evaluating our allowance for loan losses which consider all information available to us 
however  we must rely on estimates and judgments regarding issues where the outcome is unknown 
as a consequence  if circumstances change the allowance for loan losses may decrease or increase significantly 
the calculation of our allowance for loan losses consists of three components 
the first component requires us to identify impaired loans based on management classification and  if necessary  assign a valuation allowance to the impaired loans 
valuation allowances are established using management estimates of the fair value of collateral and based on valuation models that present value estimated expected future cash flows 
these valuations are based on available information and require estimates and subjective judgments about fair values of the collateral or expected future cash flows 
most of our loans do not have an observable market price and an estimate of the collection of contractual cash flows is based on the judgment of management 
it is likely that we would obtain materially different results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
this would include updated information that came to management s attention about the loans or a change in the current economic environment 
as a consequence of the estimates and assumptions required to calculate the first component of our allowance for loan losses  a change in these highly uncertain estimates could have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the second component of the allowance requires us to group loans that have similar credit risk characteristics so as to form a basis for predicting losses based on loss percentages and delinquency trends as it relates to the group 
management assigns an allowance to these groups of loans by utilizing data such as historical loss experiences  loan to value ratios  concentration of credit risk  and delinquency trends 
management uses significant judgment to qualitatively adjust the historical loss experiences for current trends that existed at period end that were not reflected in the calculated historical loss ratios 
a subsequent change in data trends may result in material changes in this component of the allowance from period to period 
the third component of the allowance is the unassigned portion of the allowance 
this component addresses certain industry and geographic concentrations  the view of regulators  model imprecision  change in underwriting standards and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
this component requires substantial management judgment in adjusting the allowance for the changes in the current economic climate compared to the economic environment that existed historically 
due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unassigned portion of the allowance  the relationship of the unassigned component to the total allowance may fluctuate substantially from period to period 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of incurred credit losses as of the statement of financial condition date 
as of december   our allowance for loan losses was million 
see provision for loan losses for a discussion of the amounts of our allowance assigned to each loan product and the amount of our unassigned allowance 
the estimated allowance derived from the above methodology may be significantly different from actual realized losses 
actual losses incurred in the future are highly dependent upon future events  including the economies of geographic areas in which we hold loans 
these uncertainties are beyond management s control 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their examination 
we periodically analyze our loan portfolio by monitoring the loan mix  credit quality  historical trends and economic conditions 
as a consequence  our allowance for loan losses estimates will change from period to period 
a 
table of contents portion of the change in our loan loss estimates during the five year period ended december  resulted from changes in credit policies which focused our loan production on collateral based loans and the discontinuation of certain loan products 
we believe that these changes reduced our allowance for loan losses as measured by the decline in our allowance to loan losses to total loans from at december  to at december  if our historical loss experience increased or decreased in the assigned portion of the allowance for loan losses by basis points at december   we estimate that our pre tax earnings would increase or decrease by approximately million 
valuation of securities and trading activities we record our securities available for sale  investment securities  trading securities and derivative instruments in our statement of financial condition at fair value 
we use the following three methods for valuation obtaining market price quotes  using a price matrix  and applying a management valuation model 
the following table provides the sources of fair value for our securities  brokerage industry securities and derivatives instruments at december  in thousands national broker market price price valuation quotes quotes model total securities mortgage backed securities tax exempt securities other securities us treasury notes equity securities total securities brokerage industry securities and derivatives securities owned securities sold not yet purchased total brokerage industry securities total equity securities trade daily on various stock exchanges 
the fair value of these securities in our statement of financial condition was based on the closing price quotations at period end 
the closing quotation represents inter dealer quotations without retail markups  markdowns or commissions and do not necessarily represent actual transactions 
we adjust our equity securities available for sale to fair value monthly with a corresponding increase or decrease  net of income taxes  to other comprehensive income 
declines in the fair value of individual securities below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs through charges to earnings of the individual securities to their fair value 
we subscribe to a third party service to obtain a pricing matrix to determine the fair value of our debt securities 
the pricing matrix computes a fair value of debt securities based on the securities coupon rate  maturity date and estimates of future prepayment rates 
the valuations obtained from the pricing matrix are not actual transactions and may not reflect the actual amount that would be realized upon sale 
it is likely that we would obtain materially different results if different interest rate and prepayment assumptions were used in the valuation 
we adjust our debt securities available for sale to fair value monthly with a corresponding increase or decrease  net of income taxes  to other comprehensive income 
debt securities held to maturity are recorded at historical cost with the fair value disclosed on our statement of financial condition 
declines in the fair value of individual securities 
table of contents below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs through charges to earnings of the individual securities to their fair value 
at december   the fair value and unrealized loss associated with our securities was million and million  respectively 
if interest rates were to decline by basis points  we estimate that the fair value of our debt securities portfolio would increase by million 
in contrast  if interest rates were to increase by basis points  we estimate that the fair value of our debt securities would decline by million 
the above changes in value are based on various assumptions concerning prepayment rates and shifts in the interest rate yield curve and do not take into account any mitigating steps that management might take in response to changes in interest rates 
we are likely to obtain significantly different results if these assumptions were changed 
securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings 
the fair value of these securities is determined by obtaining security values from various sources  including dealer price quotations and price quotations for similar instruments traded and management estimates 
the majority of our securities owned are listed on national markets or market quotes can be obtained from brokers 
the fair values of securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased are highly volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and changes in the market environment 
the most significant factors affecting the valuation of securities owned and securities sold but not yet purchased is the lack of liquidity and credit quality of the issuer 
lack of liquidity results when trading in a position or a market sector has slowed significantly or ceased and quotes may not be available 
impairment of goodwill and other indefinite live intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment annually 
the test requires us to determine the fair value of our reporting units and compare the reporting units fair value to its carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using discounted cash flow present value techniques and management valuation models 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
these fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment 
changes in management s valuation of its reporting units may affect future earnings through the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
at september  our goodwill impairment testing date the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
if the fair value of our reporting units declines below the carrying amount we would have to perform the second step of the impairment test 
this step requires us to fair value all assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
this allocation will include core deposit intangible assets that are currently not recognized on our financial statements 
these unrecognized assets may result in a significant impairment of goodwill 
at december   total goodwill was million 
the fair value of our bank operations and ryan beck reportable segments assigned goodwill exceeds the carrying value by million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when testing a long lived asset for recoverability  it may be necessary to review estimated lives and adjust the depreciation period 
changes in circumstances and the estimates of future cash flows as well as evaluating estimated lives of long lived assets are subjective and involve a significant amount of judgment 
a change in the estimated life of a long lived asset may substantially increase depreciation and amortization expense in subsequent periods 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  we are required to group long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other assets 
these cash flows are based on projections from management reports which are based on subjective interdepartmental allocations 
fair values are not available for many of our long lived assets  and estimates must be based on available information  including prices of similar assets and present value valuation techniques 
at december   total property and equipment was million 

table of contents our core deposit intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment at the branch level by reviewing the undiscounted cash flows by branch in order to assess recoverability 
at december  our core deposit intangible asset was million 
the undiscounted cash flows of the branches assigned to the core deposit intangible asset exceeded its carrying amount at december  during the second quarter of  we relocated our corporate headquarters and finalized a plan to raze the old corporate headquarters building and construct a branch on the site 
as a consequence of the relocation and the expected demolition of the old corporate headquarters building we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december  the facilities are classified as held and used  as defined by fasb statement no 
as a bank branch is operating on the site 
during  we finalized a plan to renovate the interior of bankatlantic s branches 
as a result of the renovation plan  bankatlantic shortened the estimated lives of branch fixed assets resulting in million and  of accelerated depreciation and amortization during and  respectively 
accounting for business combinations the company accounts for its business combinations based on the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires us to fair value the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the fair values are based on available information and current economic conditions at the date of acquisition 
the fair values may be obtained from independent appraisers  discounted cash flow present value techniques  management valuation models  quoted prices on national markets or quoted market prices from brokers 
these fair value estimates will affect future earnings through the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
such different fair value estimates could affect future earnings through different values being utilized for the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired 
accounting for contingencies contingent liabilities consist of liabilities that we may incur in connection with ryan beck arbitration proceedings  litigation and regulatory and tax uncertainties arising from the conduct of our business activities 
we have established reserves for legal  regulatory and other claims when it becomes probable that we will incur a loss and the loss is reasonably estimated 
we have attorneys  consultants and other professionals assessing the probability of the estimated amounts 
changes in these assessments can lead to changes in the recorded reserves and the actual costs of resolving the claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved for the claim 
the reserving for contingencies is based on management s judgment on uncertain events in which changes in circumstances could significantly affect the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
at december   total reserves for contingent liabilities included in other liabilities were million  including a million reserve established during the fourth quarter of relating to the aml bsa compliance matter see item a 
risk factors 
dividends the availability of funds for dividend payments depends upon bankatlantic s and ryan beck s ability to pay dividends to the company 
current regulations applicable to the payment of cash dividends by savings institutions impose limits on capital distributions based on an institution s regulatory capital levels  retained net income and net income 
see regulation and supervision limitation on capital distributions 
subject to the results of operations and regulatory capital requirements for bankatlantic and indenture restrictions  we will seek to declare regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 

table of contents bankatlantic bancorp impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general price levels 
although interest rates generally move in the same direction as inflation  the magnitude of such changes varies 
the possible effect of fluctuating interest rates is discussed more fully under the section entitled consolidated interest rate risk in item a below 

table of contents homebuilding real estate development our homebuilding real estate development segment consists of levitt  which is consolidated with bfc financial corporation 
the only assets available to bfc financial corporation are dividends when and if paid by levitt 
levitt is a separate public company and its management prepared the following discussion regarding levitt which was included in levitt s annual report on form k for the year ended december  filed with the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  references to the company  we  us or our in the following discussion under the caption homebuilding real estate development are references to levitt and its subsidiaries  and are not references to bfc financial corporation 
executive overview management evaluates the performance and prospects of the company and its subsidiaries using a variety of financial and non financial measures 
the key financial measures utilized to evaluate historical operating performance include revenues from sales of real estate  cost of sales of real estate  margin which we measure as revenues from sales of real estate minus cost of sales of real estate  margin percentage which we measure as margin divided by revenues from sales of real estate  income before taxes and net income 
non financial measures used to evaluate both historical performance and our future prospects include number of homes delivered  the number and value of new orders executed  the number of housing starts  the average selling price of our homes and the number of homes delivered  the number of homes and acres in backlog which we measure as homes or land subject to executed sales contracts and the aggregate value of those contracts 
additionally  we monitor the number of properties remaining in inventory and under contract to be purchased relative to our sales and construction trends 
the company s ratio of debt to shareholders equity and cash requirements are also considered when evaluating the company s future prospects as are general economic factors and interest rate trends 
some of the above measures are discussed in the following sections as they relate to our operating results  financial position and liquidity 
the list of measures above is not an exhaustive list  and we may from time to time utilize additional financial and non financial information or may not use each of the measures listed above 
outlook was a transitional year 
after posting record earnings in following several sequential years of strong growth  we identified certain organizational and infrastructure issues which needed to be addressed in order to support continued growth 
we concluded that additional investment would be required to strengthen the management team  increase field construction capacity and competency and standardize policies and procedures to enhance operational consistency 
while total revenue grew marginally in  profitability declined reflecting our increased expenditures on infrastructure and a decline in home deliveries in higher average selling prices in enabled us to enter with a record backlog in dollar terms 
we also enter with a stronger and more diversified inventory position as a result of the opening of several new communities and expansion into regions outside of the state of florida 
the competitive environment for homebuilding varies by region and also among our various communities  but market conditions in generally appear to have softened and homebuyers appear to be more cautious in their home purchases 
we are increasing our investment in advertising and other promotional incentives  expanding third party broker programs and retraining our sales force with a view toward increasing traffic and improving conversion rates 
we instituted improved quality control programs and customer satisfaction initiatives to improve the company s reputation  referral rate and competitive position 
while historically we have been able to raise the prices of our new homes due to strong consumer demand  such strong pricing power appears to be weaker although opportunities to increase prices exist in certain regions and at some of our projects 
we anticipate that the combination of relatively stable prices  higher marketing costs and rising construction costs could exert downward pressure on homebuilding margins in the future 
in addition  we believe continued infrastructure investments will be necessary to fund projects launched in and to realize growth goals 

table of contents impact of historical growth on operations and future prospects due in large part to stronger than expected sales of new homes in prior periods  we experienced production challenges in some of our homebuilding communities and our inventory of homes available for sale was greatly diminished 
those increased sales led to extended delivery cycles in and beyond our month target 
as a result of the extended delivery cycles and our depleted inventory levels  we slowed the pace of sales throughout our florida communities beginning in late current results of operations reflect the slower pace of sales 
we engaged outside consultants to assist the company in reviewing our organizational structure  production and operational practices 
we expect that results of operations will benefit from the revised policies and practices starting in we continue to replenish our lot inventory in florida  georgia  tennessee and south carolina and new communities have recently opened in each of those locations 
in addition  we have entered into contracts to acquire approximately  additional lots to support growth in and beyond 
while the value of our backlog  reflecting higher average selling prices  has grown in comparison to december   the backlog of units decreased slightly as of december  from the level 
the backlog is expected to grow in the future as our organizational and infrastructure improvements permit us to increase the pace of sales in association with the opening of additional communities 
the average selling price of our homes continues to increase and our overall margin percentages have thus far resisted compression due primarily to the favorable selling conditions in the florida markets where the majority of our operations are currently located  however  as noted above  there is no assurance that these conditions will continue in critical accounting policies and estimates management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and assumptions that affect the recognition of revenues and expenses on the statements of income for the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods relate to the determination of the valuation of real estate and estimated costs to complete construction  the valuation of carrying values of investments in joint ventures  the valuation of the fair market value of assets and liabilities in the application of the purchase method of accounting and the amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we have identified the following accounting policies that management views as critical to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory of real estate inventory of real estate includes land  land development costs  interest and other construction costs and is stated at accumulated cost or  when circumstances indicate that the inventory is impaired  at estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on disposition of real estate in the normal course of business under existing and anticipated market conditions 
the valuation takes into consideration the current status of the property  various restrictions  carrying costs  costs of disposition and any other circumstances which may affect fair value  including management s plans for the property 
due to the large acreage of certain land holdings and the nature of our project development life cycles  disposition in the normal course of business is expected to extend over a number of years 
land and indirect land development costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to various parcels or housing units using either specific identification or apportioned based upon the relative sales value  unit or area methods 
direct construction costs are assigned to housing units based on specific identification 
construction costs primarily include direct construction costs and capitalized field overhead 
other costs are comprised of tangible selling costs  prepaid local government fees and capitalized real estate taxes 
tangible selling costs are capitalized by communities and represent costs incurred throughout the selling period to aid in the sale of housing units  such as model furnishings and decorations  sales office furnishings and facilities  exhibits  displays and signage 
these tangible selling costs are capitalized and expensed to cost of sales of the benefited home sales 
start up costs and other selling costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents the expected future costs of development are analyzed at least annually to determine the appropriate allocation factors to charge to the remaining inventory as cost of sales when such inventory is sold 
during the long term project development cycles in our land division  such development costs are subject to more relative volatility than similar costs in homebuilding 
costs to complete infrastructure will be influenced by changes in direct costs associated with labor and materials  as well as changes in development orders and regulatory compliance 
investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries we follow the equity method of accounting to record our interests in subsidiaries in which we do not own the majority of the voting stock and to record our investment in variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary 
these entities consist of bluegreen corporation  joint ventures and statutory business trusts 
the statutory business trusts are variable interest entities in which the company is not the primary beneficiary 
under the equity method  the initial investment in a joint venture is recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted to recognize our share of the joint venture s earnings or losses 
distributions received reduce the carrying amount of the investment 
these investments are evaluated annually or as events or circumstances warrant for other than temporary declines in value 
evidence of other than temporary declines includes the inability of the joint venture or investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment and consistent joint venture operating losses 
the evaluation is based on available information including condition of the property and current and anticipated real estate market conditions 
homesite contracts and consolidation of variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business we enter into contracts to purchase homesites and land held for development 
option contracts allow us to control significant homesite positions with minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
our liability for nonperformance under such contracts is typically only the required deposits  and typically our deposits or letters of credit are less than of the underlying purchase price 
we do not have legal title to these assets 
however  if certain conditions are met under the requirements of fasb interpretation no 
r  the company s land contracts may create a variable interest for the company  with the company being identified as the primary beneficiary 
if these conditions are met  interpretation no 
requires us to consolidate the assets homesites at their fair value 
at december  there were no assets under these contracts consolidated in our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue and all related costs and expenses from house and land sales are recognized at the time that closing has occurred  when title and possession of the property and the risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the buyer  and when other sale and profit recognition criteria are satisfied as required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for real estate transactions 
in order to properly match revenues with expenses  we estimate construction and land development costs incurred but not paid at the time of closing 
estimated costs to complete are determined for each closed home and land sale based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
we monitor the accuracy of estimates by comparing actual costs incurred subsequent to closing to the estimate made at the time of closing and make modifications to the estimates based on these comparisons 
we do not expect the estimation process to change in the future 
capitalized interest interest incurred relating to land under development and construction is capitalized to real estate inventories during the active development period 
interest is capitalized as a component of inventory at the effective rates paid on borrowings during the pre construction and planning stage and during the periods that projects are under development 
capitalization of interest is discontinued if development ceases at a project 
interest is amortized to cost of sales on the relative sales value method as related homes  and land are sold 

table of contents income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled

for the year ended december  compared to the same period consolidated net income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in net income primarily resulted from a decrease in sales of real estate by our homebuilding division  coupled with an increase in overall selling  general and administrative expenses associated with our expansion into new markets  increased headcount  and our efforts to improve our organizational structure  production and operational practices 
the impact of lower homebuilding revenue  higher spending on overhead  technology  training and infrastructure and lower earnings from joint ventures was partially mitigated by increases in sales by our land division and levitt commercial  as well as an increase in interest and other income 

table of contents our consolidated revenues from sales of real estate increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period 
this increase is attributable primarily to an increase in consolidated revenue from the land division which increased to million in and an increase at levitt commercial from million in to million in these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in homebuilding division revenues as a result of fewer deliveries 
the land division s segment revenues of million in include million of sales to the homebuilding division which are eliminated in consolidation because they represent inter company sales 
the increase in the land division revenue is attributable primarily to the first quarter bulk sale for million of five non contiguous parcels of land consisting of  acres adjacent to our tradition  florida master planned community 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during compared to million for the same period primarily as a result of higher employee compensation and benefits expenses and an increase in professional fees

further  we incurred start up costs such as advertising and administrative expenses associated with launching new communities in atlanta  georgia  myrtle beach  south carolina and nashville  tennessee 
the number of our full time employees increased to at december   from as of december  in addition  expenses incurred during the year ended december  reflect the full inclusion of bowden s operations  which operations were included commencing with its acquisition in may in connection with our initiatives to improve infrastructure  we incurred expenses associated with technology upgrades  training and human resource development and communications 
we engaged consultants in to assist us in a detailed operational and organizational review 
following that detailed evaluation  we concluded that additional infrastructure investment and organizational change would be necessary in order to support growth objectives of the homebuilding division 
as a result  the company was organizationally restructured into regional teams with matrixed  multi functional relationships 
at the same time  we implemented numerous initiatives to support the new regional structure and increased infrastructure investment  which included recruiting additional managers  particularly in field operations  the evaluation  documentation  and implementation of industry best practices  the selection and implementation of a common technology platform  the development of curriculum and training programs  and formalized management communications relating to strategies and priorities 
overhead expense associated with this broad range of organizational and operational initiatives has increased  reflecting our higher employee headcount  retention of outside consultants and other direct program costs 
we anticipate these higher levels of overhead expenses will continue into as the various programs are implemented and completed  and as a consequence selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to grow both in absolute dollar levels and as a percentage of total revenues throughout interest incurred totaled million and million for and  respectively 
interest incurred was higher due to higher outstanding balances of notes and mortgage notes payable related to increases in our inventory of real estate and to an increase in interest rates associated with rising interest rate indices which impacted our variable rate indebtedness 
interest capitalized was million for and million for cost of sales of real estate for the year ended december  and included previously capitalized interest of approximately million and million  respectively

the restatement accounts for the sales of notes receivable as on balance sheet financing transactions as opposed to off balance sheet sales transactions as bluegreen had originally accounted for these transactions 
levitt recorded the cumulative effect of the restatement in the year ended december  this cumulative adjustment was recorded as a million reduction of earnings from bluegreen and a million increase in our pro rata share of unrealized gains recognized by bluegreen 
these adjustments resulted in a million reduction to our investment in bluegreen

during the year ended december   there were no unit deliveries by the company s joint ventures which were winding down operations 
the increase in interest and other income of million is primarily related to an increase in rental income  higher balances of interest earning deposits at various financial institutions  a non recurring contingent termination payment received from a previously dissolved partnership  and the reversal of accrued construction obligations associated with certain future infrastructure development requirements in our land division 
the total increase in these items of approximately million was offset by the absence of a one time million reduction of a litigation reserve which was recorded in the million reduction of a litigation reserve was the result of our successful appeal of a judgment which reversed the damages awarded by the trial jury and ordered a new trial to determine damages

our revenues from sales of real estate increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period 
this increase is attributable primarily to an increase in home deliveries from  homes delivered in to  homes delivered in land sale revenues in included sales to the homebuilding division of million 
these inter segment transactions were eliminated in consolidation and the profit recognized by the land division from these sales will be deferred until the homebuilding division delivers homes on these properties to third parties 
at that time  consolidated cost of sales will be reduced by amount of land division profits that were deferred 
consolidated cost of sales was reduced by approximately million in as a result of the recognition of previously deferred profits related to sales of land by our land division to our homebuilding division 
approximately million of similarly deferred profits were recognized during selling  general and administrative expenses increased during compared to the same period primarily as a result of higher employee compensation and benefits including sales commissions and incentive bonuses  and increased insurance and professional service expenses 
the increase in employee compensation and benefits expense was directly related to our new development projects in central and south florida  the expansion of homebuilding activities into north florida and georgia  the addition of bowden and the increase in our home deliveries 
the number of our full time employees increased to at december  from at december   and the number of part time employees declined slightly to at december  from at december  the increase in insurance and professional service expenses related primarily to costs associated with operating as an independent public company since the spin off from bankatlantic bancorp

earnings from real estate joint ventures was million during as compared to  for this increase in earnings in our real estate joint venture activities primarily resulted from gains recognized upon the sale of a joint venture s property in vero beach  florida  earnings associated with the delivery of condominium units by a joint venture project in boca raton  florida and earnings associated with the delivery of homes by a joint venture project in west palm beach  florida 
all three joint venture projects are sold out and their operations are essentially completed

homebuilding division revenues declined by in compared to the same period in  reflecting fewer homes delivered in offset slightly by higher average selling prices 
the company s sales performance in florida in and exceeded our projections and production capacity 
as a result  our delivery cycle in and extended beyond our month target  and the number of homes we closed in declined as compared to we have implemented changes to our organizational structure  production and operational practices in an attempt to shorten cycle times to enable us to deliver homes within months 
we believe that shorter delivery cycles will increase customer satisfaction  reduce the amount of time contracted homes are in backlog  and thereby reduce our exposure to rising costs 

table of contents at december   our homebuilding division had a delivery backlog of  homes representing million of future sales 
the average sales price of the homes in backlog at december  of  is approximately higher than the average sales price of the homes in backlog at december  this increase is attributable to rising prices based on the demand for homes  as well as the particular markets generating the backlog 
while the backlog value is encouraging for our results  adverse economic trends such as rising interest rates  continued inflationary pressures and labor shortages could impact our homebuilding division in future periods 
in  the costs of lumber  steel  concrete and other building materials rose significantly 
additionally  labor costs rose during the year reflecting a shortage of sub contractors in some of the markets in which we build 
the redeployment of labor in florida following two years of active hurricane seasons exacerbated the labor shortage in these markets 
while we may be able to increase our future selling prices to absorb the increased costs  the sales prices of homes in our backlog cannot be increased and the margins on the delivery of homes in backlog may be adversely affected by this trend 
we are also continuing to seek to expand our homebuilding activities in the jacksonville  florida  atlanta  georgia  nashville  tennessee and myrtle beach  south carolina markets 
our first sales in jacksonville  nashville and atlanta  aggregating units in total  occurred in we anticipate revenues from deliveries in these markets will be recognized during the second half of costs associated with expansion in new markets will remain at elevated levels during for the year ended december  compared to the same period the value of new orders increased to million for from million in as a result of higher average sales prices and increased number of orders 
higher selling prices were primarily a reflection of the continued strength of the florida market and the shift in our tennessee operations away from the first time entry level buyer to a higher end customer 
new unit orders modestly increased to  units in  from  units during as additional inventory became available for sale 
further  our expanded presence in tennessee and georgia contributed to new order flow 
construction starts declined in primarily due to the delayed sales and delayed scheduled construction cycles 
revenues from home sales decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to decreased home deliveries 
while home deliveries in tennessee increased to units delivered from units delivered during  reflecting a full year of operations  home deliveries in florida decreased to  units delivered from  units delivered during the same period 
the decrease in florida deliveries was attributable to the lower backlog at december   an increased emphasis on quality and customer service which delayed closings  as well as a reduction in construction starts during the year as discussed above 
construction cycle times generally improved  although some projects continued to experience subcontractor delays and project related management issues 
cost of sales decreased by approximately to million in from million in the decrease in cost of sales was attributable to fewer deliveries 
cost of sales as a percentage of related revenue was approximately for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  this slight increase was due primarily to increases in labor and raw material costs in and a higher percentage of homes sold in the tennessee region  which produces lower margins than other regions and accounted for the higher cost of sales percentage 
deliveries in the tennessee region represented of total deliveries  compared with in we are integrating the region onto the same technology platform as our other regions and are standardizing operating policies and procedures in an effort to improve margins and profitability in our tennessee region 
in addition  we are shifting our strategy in tennessee from acquiring finished lots for smaller subdivisions to acquiring and developing raw land for signature communities which resemble our communities in other regions  and eventually introducing active adult communities to the tennessee market 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million for in connection with our detailed operational and organizational review  we made significant expenditures for infrastructure investment we believe is necessary to support our growth objectives 
further  there were higher expenses as a result of the inclusion of bowden expenses for the full year of compared with only eight months 
table of contents in  and the higher costs associated with increasing headcount and market expansion 
as a percentage of total revenues  our selling  general and administrative expense was approximately during the twelve months ended december   compared to during the same period 
the increase was specifically attributable to increased employee compensation and benefits costs associated with new hires in central and south florida  and the continued expansion of homebuilding activities into the jacksonville  atlanta  myrtle beach and nashville markets  incurring administrative start up costs  including advertising 
interest incurred and capitalized on notes and mortgages payable totaled million during  compared to million incurred and million capitalized during the same period 
interest incurred increased as a result of an increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate borrowings and an increase in borrowings in associated with the company s purchases of land to replenish its inventory of homesites 
at the time of a home sale  the related capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales 
cost of sales of real estate during and included previously capitalized interest of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in other expenses of million was primarily attributable to certain non recurring expenses recorded in  including a charge of million  net of insurance recoveries  to account for the costs of remediating hurricane related damage in the company s florida operations 
in  the homebuilding division did not incur any hurricane related expense 
for  other expenses were comprised of mortgage operations expense and an additional reserve recorded for our share of costs associated with a litigation settlement reached in a matter in which we were a joint venture partner 
the decrease in interest and other income in is primarily related to a million reduction of a litigation reserve recorded in as a result of our successful appeal of a judgment 
the appellate court reversed the damages awarded by the trial jury and ordered a new trial to determine damages 
the litigation reserve was reduced based on our assessment of the potential liability 
we did not enter into any new joint venture development or other joint venture agreements in the decrease in earnings in joint ventures resulted primarily from the completion of unit deliveries in by a joint venture developing a condominium complex in boca raton  florida 
that joint venture delivered the final condominium units during the final  square feet of commercial space in the project was delivered during the year ended december  for the year ended december  compared to the same period the value of new orders declined to million for  from million in the decline in new orders was primarily the result of the absence of new community openings to offset stronger than expected order growth in prior periods and our intentional slowing of the pace of new home orders to help assure higher levels of customer satisfaction by meeting delivery schedules acceptable to our customers 
some of our florida communities sold out faster than originally anticipated and new communities were not yet ready for sales 
while this strengthened our backlog  we experienced a short term decline in saleable inventory 
new orders were also impacted by the adverse impact of four hurricanes in florida during august and september 
these factors led to a slowdown in sales in our florida homebuilding operations in the third and fourth quarters of  when new orders were placed for homes  as compared with the record  new orders placed in the third and fourth quarters of revenues from home sales increased to million in from million in  due primarily to an increase in home deliveries in communities that commenced deliveries in and from bowden s operations 
during   homes were delivered at an average selling price of approximately  as compared to  homes delivered in at an average selling price of approximately  the modest increase in the average selling price of our homes was due primarily to a change in our product mix resulting from the inclusion of bowden in the average selling price of the homes in our florida communities increased by  over to  the average selling price of bowden s homes was cost of sales increased by approximately to million in from million in due primarily to an increase in the number of home deliveries

lucie west is substantially complete  with acres of inventory remaining at december   which are subject to firm sales contracts 
the master planned community  tradition  florida encompasses more than  total acres  
table of contents including approximately  net saleable acres 
approximately  acres had been sold and were subject to firm sales contracts with various homebuilders as of december  during  our land division purchased two parcels of land in jasper county  south carolina to develop a master planned community for a combined purchase price of approximately million 
the master planned community  tradition  south carolina  now encompasses more than  total acres  including approximately  net saleable acres and is currently entitled to include up to  residential units and up to million feet of commercial space  in addition to recreational areas  educational facilities and emergency services 
development activity began in the fourth quarter of in addition to sales to third party homebuilders  the land division periodically sells residential land to the homebuilding division on a priority basis at intercompany prices that we believe approximate arms length pricing 
the land division will also continue to sell undeveloped commercial property to commercial developers  but will be more active in internally developing certain projects 
we calculate margin as sales of real estate minus cost of sales of real estate  and have historically realized between and margin on land division sales 
margins fluctuate based upon changing sales prices and costs attributable to the land sold 
the sales price of land sold varies depending upon the location  the parcel size  whether the parcel is sold as raw land  partially developed land or individually developed lots  the degree to which the land is entitled  and whether the ultimate use of land is residential or commercial 
the cost of sales of real estate is dependent upon the original cost of the land acquired  the timing of the acquisition of the land  and the amount of development and carrying costs capitalized to the particular land parcel 
allocations to costs of sales involve management judgment and an estimate of future costs of development  which can vary over time due to labor and material cost increases  master plan design changes and regulatory modifications 
accordingly  allocations are subject to change for elements often beyond management control 
future margins will continue to vary in response to these and other market factors

we sold a greater percentage of undeveloped and unentitled land in relative to the decrease in margin is also attributable to the mix of acreage sold  with a decrease in commercial property sales at st 
lucie west 
the margin percentage on the tradition  florida acreage tends to be lower due to the stage of the development and the higher proportion of residential sales which generally have a lower margin to commercial sales in the same period

the increase in other expenses was primarily attributable to a  pre payment penalty on debt repayment incurred during the first quarter of we repaid indebtedness under a line of credit using a portion of the proceeds of the bulk sale described above 
the increase in interest and other income of million is primarily related to the reversal of certain accrued construction obligations 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million in accrued construction obligations 
these accrued construction obligations were recorded as property was sold to recognize our obligations to comply with future infrastructure development requirements of governmental entities

total liabilities at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in total liabilities primarily resulted from an increase of million in customer deposits associated with our larger backlog at year end a net increase in notes and mortgage notes payable of million  primarily related to project debt associated with the land acquisitions described above  and an increase in junior subordinated debentures of million 
an increase in the deferred tax liability of approximately million which was primarily associated with our investment in bluegreen 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we assess the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investment activities 
during the year ended december   our primary sources of funds were the proceeds from the sale of real estate inventory  the issuance of trust preferred securities and borrowings from financial institutions 
these funds were utilized primarily to acquire  develop and construct real estate  to service and repay borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
in  the company formed two statutory business trusts  levitt capital trust i lct i and levitt capital trust ii lct ii  for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated debentures of the company 
the issuance of trust preferred securities was part of a larger pooled trust securities offering which was not registered under the securities act of on march   lct i issued million of trust preferred securities 
the trust used the proceeds from issuing trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures the lct i debentures from the company 
interest on the lct i debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears at a fixed rate of through march  and thereafter at a floating rate of over month london interbank offered rate libor until the scheduled maturity date of march  distributions on the trust preferred securities will be cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the lct i debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the lct i debentures are redeemable five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  we contributed  to the trust in exchange for all of the trust s common securities and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of lct i debentures from the company 
the terms of the trust s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities 
we used the proceeds to repay approximately million of indebtedness to affiliates 
on may   lct ii issued million of trust preferred securities and used the proceeds to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures the lct ii debentures from the company 
interest on the lct ii debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears at a fixed rate of through june  and thereafter at a floating rate of over month libor until the scheduled maturity date of june  the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the lct ii debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the lct ii debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  the company contributed  to lct ii in exchange for all of its common securities and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of lct ii debentures from the company 
the terms of the trust s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities

the company relies on third party financing to fund the acquisition and development of land 
as disclosed in note to the company s financial statements  during the year ended december   our principal operating subsidiaries  levitt and sons and core communities  secured borrowing facilities with third party lenders to fund land acquisitions and development 
as of december   these loan agreements provided in the aggregate for advances  subject to available collateral  on a revolving basis of up to million  of which million was outstanding 
the loans are secured by mortgages on properties  including improvements 
principal payments are required as sales of the collateral are consummated 
our principal payment obligations with respect to our debt for the months beginning december  are anticipated to total approximately million 
approximately million of the debt due in the next twelve months is construction related financing which will be repaid with the proceeds from the sales of the properties under construction 
some of our borrowing agreements contain provisions that  among other things  require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth 
these requirements may limit the amount of debt that we can incur in the future and restrict the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries 
certain notes and mortgage notes provide that events of default include a change in ownership  management or executive management 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan agreement financial requirements and covenants 
the company believes it has sufficient availability under 
table of contents its existing borrowing facilities and adequate access to additional borrowing facilities to meet its current contractual obligations 
in addition to the liquidity provided by the trust preferred securities and the credit facilities described above  we expect to continue to fund our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and other financing activities and our available cash 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for items such as acquisitions and debt service and repayment obligations primarily with net cash provided by operations and long term secured and unsecured indebtedness 
as of december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
on each of january    april   july   november  and january  our board of directors declared cash dividends of per share on our class a common stock and class b common stock 
these dividends were paid in february  may  august  november and february  respectively 
the board has not adopted a policy of regular dividend payments 
the payment of dividends in the future is subject to approval by our board of directors and will depend upon  among other factors  our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot give assurance that we will declare additional cash dividends in the future 
we are subject to the usual financial and other obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase  development and sale of real estate in the ordinary course of business 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations in connection with the development of certain of our communities  we establish community development districts to access bond financing for the funding of infrastructure development and other projects within the community 
if we were not able to establish community development districts  we would need to fund community infrastructure development out of operating income or through other sources of financing or capital 
the bonds issued are obligations of the community development district and are repaid through assessments on property within the district 
to the extent that we own property within a district when assessments are levied  we will be obligated to pay the assessments when they are due 
as of december   development districts in tradition  florida had million of community development district bonds outstanding  and we owned approximately of the property in those districts 
during  we recorded approximately  in assessments on property we owned in the districts 
these costs were capitalized to inventory as development costs and will be recognized as cost of sales when the assessed properties are sold to third parties 
we entered into an indemnity agreement in april with a joint venture partner at altman longleaf  relating to  among other obligations  that partner s guarantee of the joint venture s indebtedness 
our liability under the indemnity agreement is limited to the amount of any distributions from the joint venture which exceeds our original capital and other contributions 
our original capital contributions were approximately  in  we received an additional distribution that totaled approximately million 
in january  we received a distribution of approximately  accordingly  our potential obligation of indemnity after the january distribution is approximately  based on the joint venture assets that secure the indebtedness  we do not believe it is likely that any payment will be required under the indemnity agreement

levitt impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
inflation could have a long term impact on us by contributing to increased costs of land  materials and labor  the net effect of which could require us to increase the sales prices of homes in order to preserve our profit margins 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates which could have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates as well as increased materials and labor costs may reduce margins

 accounting for sales of real estate  and no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  in association with the issuance of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions 
sop was issued to address the diversity in practice caused by a lack of guidance specific to real estate time sharing transactions 
among other things  the new standard addresses the treatment of sales incentives provided by a seller to a buyer to consummate a transaction  the calculation of accounting for uncollectible notes receivable  the recognition of changes in inventory cost estimates  recovery or repossession of vois  selling and marketing costs  operations during holding periods  developer subsidies to property owners associations and upgrade and reload transactions

the sampler program gives purchasers an opportunity to utilize the bluegreen s vacation ownership product through a one year allotment of bluegreen vacation club points 
in the event the sampler purchaser subsequently purchases a vacation ownership interest from bluegreen  a portion of the amount paid for their sampler package is credited toward the down payment on this subsequent purchase 
under the sop  the credit given will result in the deferral of such sales until the minimum down payment amounts are received from the purchaser  typically through their required mortgage payments 
deferrals under the sop are expected to be ongoing  with deferred resorts sales being recognized in subsequent quarters once the required down payment amount is received 
at this time  bluegreen has not yet completed their evaluation of the charge 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk consolidated market risk market risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market valuations which arise from interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and equity price risk 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk and our secondary market risk is equity price risk 
because bankatlantic bancorp and levitt are consolidated in the company s financial statements an increase or decrease in the market price of their stock would not impact the financial statements 
however  a significant change in the market price of either of these securities would likely have an effect on the market price of our common stock 
the market price of bfc s common stock and of bfc s directly held equity securities are important to the valuation and financing capability of bfc 
bankatlantic bancorp consolidated interest rate risk the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities expected to reprice or mature in each of the indicated periods was as follows in thousands as of december  year years years more than or less or less or less years total interest earning assets loans residential loans fixed rate hybrids arm less than years hybrids arm more than years commercial loans small business loans consumer total loans investment securities tax exempt securities taxable investment securities tax certificates total investment securities total interest earning assets total non earning assets total assets total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities total non interest bearing liabilities and equity gap repricing difference cumulative gap repricing percentage cumulative percentage hybrid adjustable rate mortgages arm earn fixed rates for designated periods and adjust annually thereafter based on the one year us treasury note rate 
the majority of bankatlantic s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  subjecting bankatlantic to significant interest rate risk because its assets and liabilities reprice at different times  market interest rates change differently among the rate indices and certain interest earning assets  primarily residential loans  may be prepaid before maturity as interest rates change 
bankatlantic has developed a model using standard industry software to measure its interest rate risk 
the model performs a sensitivity analysis that measures the effect on its net interest income of changes in interest rates 
the model 
table of contents measures the impact that parallel interest rate shifts of and basis points would have on our net interest income over a month period 
the model calculates the change in net interest income by i 
calculating interest income and interest expense from existing assets and liabilities using current repricing  prepayment and volume assumptions  ii 
estimating the change in expected net interest income based on instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve to determine the effect on net interest income  and iii 
calculating the percentage change in net interest income calculated in i and ii 
management of bankatlantic has made estimates of cash flow  prepayment  repricing and volume assumptions that it believes to be reasonable 
actual results will differ from the simulated results due to changes in interest rates that differ from the assumptions in the simulation model 
certain assumptions by bankatlantic in assessing the interest rate risk were utilized in preparing the following table 
these assumptions related to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  re pricing of certain borrowings reinvestment in earning assets 
the prepayment assumptions used in the model are fixed rate mortgages fixed rate securities tax certificates adjustable rate mortgages adjustable rate securities deposit runoff assumptions used in the model are as follows within over year years years years money fund savings accounts decay rates now and savings accounts decay rates

the prior interest rate risk model measured potential gains and losses only on net portfolio fair value 
bankatlantic believes that measuring the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income will enhance management s ability to monitor interest rate risk

ryan beck market risk ryan beck s market risk is the potential change in value of financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  credit spreads or other market forces 
the company  through its broker dealer subsidiary ryan beck  is exposed to market risk arising from trading and market making activities 
ryan beck s management monitors risk in its trading activities by establishing limits and reviewing daily trading results  inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
ryan beck uses a variety of tools  including aggregate and statistical methods 
value at risk var is the principal statistical method and measures the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
substantially all the trading inventory is subject to measurement using var 
ryan beck uses an historical simulation approach to measuring var using a confidence level  a one day holding period and the most recent three months average volatility 
the var means that  on average  one would not expect to exceed such loss amount more than one time every one hundred trading days if the portfolio were held constant for a one day period 
modeling and statistical methods rely on approximations and assumptions that could be significant under certain circumstances 
as such  the risk management process also employs other methods such as sensitivity to interest rates and stress testing 
the following table sets forth the high  low and average var for ryan beck for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average var aggregate long value aggregate short value the following table sets forth the high  low and average var for ryan beck for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average var aggregate long value aggregate short value levitt levitt is subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt 
at december   levitt had million in borrowings with adjustable rates tied to the prime rate and or libor and million in borrowings with fixed rates 
consequently  for debt tied to an indexed rate  changes in interest rates may affect levitt earnings and cash flows  but generally would not impact the fair value of such debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt but not levitt s earnings or cash flow
