we do not plan to update any such forward looking statements and expressly disclaim any duty to update the information contained in this filing except as required by law 
unless the context otherwise requires  all references to the company  we  us  our  spectrum and spectrum pharmaceuticals refer to spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc and its subsidiaries  as a consolidated entity 
we primarily conduct all our activities as spectrum pharmaceuticals 

table of contents part i item business overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company with an oncology focus  committed to acquiring  developing and commercializing drug products for the treatment of cancer and other unmet medical needs 
our business strategy  which strives to reduce risk while building shareholder value  is to maintain a diversified portfolio of drugs  strengthen our development and commercialization capabilities  while concurrently sharing risk through business alliances  and take advantage of near term revenue opportunities 
our commitment is to build a successful commercial pharmaceutical company with sustainable future growth from revenue generating drug products 
since august  we have accomplished a successful turnaround by shifting our strategic focus from drug discovery  neurology drugs and genomics research  to development of a diversified drug portfolio containing primarily clinical stage oncology  or anti cancer  drugs 
during this period  we have enhanced our financial strength and capabilities by securing over million in equity financing and upfront license fees  and entering into several strategic business alliances 
these actions enabled us to acquire certain rights to four new proprietary drug product candidates  strengthen our management team  enhance our developmental and regulatory capabilities  and accelerate the development timelines of our key drug product candidates 
as of the date of filing this report  we had eight proprietary drug product candidates  or drug products with respect to which we have patent rights  either directly or through licensing  under development  including one in phase  and four in multiple phase trials  three abbreviated new drug applications andas for generic drug products approved  and ten under review by the united states food and drug administration fda  and intellectual property rights to certain neurology compounds that are available for out licensing to third parties 
business strategy our mission at spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc is to bring our expertise and passion for excellence to acquire  develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for unmet medical needs while building value for our shareholders 
the tenets of our business strategy to fulfill this mission are diverse product portfolio we believe that a diverse product portfolio increases the probability of our ultimate commercial success 
accordingly  while we continue to advance our existing product portfolio  we also evaluate additional promising proprietary drugs for acquisition or in licensing from third parties and are also selectively developing generic drugs 
near term revenues recognizing that new drug development is a lengthy process  as we evaluate additional promising drugs  we focus primarily on late stage proprietary compounds with the potential for generating revenues in the near term 
strategic alliances in general  we direct and pay for all aspects of the drug development process  and consequently incur the risks and rewards of drug development  which is an inherently uncertain and expensive process 
to mitigate such risks  to accelerate drug development timelines  and to opportunistically generate cash  we will seek to out license rights to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary products for the development and commercialization of those products  particularly outside the united states  in exchange for upfront fees  milestones  royalties and other commercialization privileges 
product commercialization as our drugs progress through development  to the point of potential fda approval for marketing in the united states  we plan to expand our sales and marketing 
table of contents capability 
however  the costs of establishing and maintaining a sales force to effectively market proprietary drug products in the united states are significant 
accordingly  to accelerate the market penetration of our proprietary products  when approved by the fda  we may seek collaborations with entities with proven sales  marketing and distribution capabilities in the united states 
due to the competitive environment of the generics market  we have determined that  sales can be maximized by partnering with a company with established generics distribution capabilities 
in our pursuit of the foregoing business strategy  during we licensed rights to three new proprietary compounds and filed five new andas 
during we are actively evaluating promising late stage proprietary compounds with the potential for near term revenues  and we expect to file additional andas in and beyond and to have multiple generic drugs fda approved and marketed in the us recent developments in december  our co development partner  gpc biotech  began the rolling submission of a new drug application nda with the fda for satraplatin  an orally bioavailable platinum compound  for use in combination with prednisone as a second line chemotherapy treatment for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc 
interim analysis results of the phase trials in hrpc are expected to be announced in late april satraplatin has been granted fast track designation by the fda  therefore  if gpc biotech completes the nda submission filing by the end of and the fda approves the nda  sales of satraplatin could commence in the united states as early as late  or early commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand have been sublicensed by gpc biotech to pharmion corporation  who expects to submit for european marketing authorization in the st quarter of  pending concurrence with the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea  the fda s european counterpart 
a successful worldwide launch of satraplatin and achievement of all regulatory and sales milestone revenues would generate revenues in excess of million for us  net of our milestone payment obligations to the original patent holder 
in addition  we will receive a royalty on worldwide sales of satraplatin  reduced by royalties payable by us to the original patent holder 
also  under certain conditions  we may have co promotion rights for satraplatin in the us this would enable us to build an oncology sales force 
in february  glaxosmithkline gsk commenced suit against us  alleging that our anda for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic form of gsk s imitrex injection  infringes their patent 
imitrex injection is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks and of cluster headache episodes in adults  and recorded estimated us revenues of approximately million in we believe that the patent that we have challenged covering gsk s imitrex injection  which  with pediatric exclusivity  is set to expire on february   is invalid  unenforceable and or or will not be infringed by our generic product candidate 
imitrex injection is also covered by a patent which together with pediatric exclusivity does not expire until june   which patent is not currently being challenged by us or any third party 
if the fda approves our anda and we are successful in our patent challenge  and are awarded six months of generic market exclusivity because we believe that we were the first to file an anda for sumatriptan succinate injection  we may be able launch our sumatriptan succinate injection product immediately upon the expiry of the june patent 
further information regarding this patent challenge can be found below 
on february   we entered into a strategic alliance with par pharmaceutical companies inc par  one of the largest generics company in the united states  to distribute generic drugs for which we have filed andas  including sumatriptan succinate injection 
we expect that we will receive fda approval for several andas during  in addition to the three previously approved generics  ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection 
the agreement also covers additional andas currently being developed by us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the company is responsible for the development of  and regulatory filings for  the generic drugs and the company will receive payments upon regulatory approval of each anda 
the agreement also provides for a share of the profits from the sale by par of the company s generic products 
in addition  par agreed to provide financial and legal support  including the payment of all legal expenses going forward  for the ongoing patent challenge for sumatriptan succinate injection 
within twenty four months of the effective date of the agreement  the company has the right to request par to make 
table of contents an equity investment in the company  which is subject to due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documents at that time 
not counting our share of the profits from sales of the generic drugs  the company could receive an aggregate of over million under the agreement if the equity investment is made and all the regulatory approvals are obtained 
we believe that this alliance completes our generic commercialization strategy  provides an excellent marketing partner for our generic products and puts us in the best position to maximize the revenue potential from our generic drug portfolio 
drug product candidates proprietary drugs new drug development  which is the process whereby drug product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing a new drug application nda or similar filing in other countries and eventually obtaining marketing approval from the fda or a marketing authorization from other regulatory authorities outside of the us  is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process which requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda in the united states  and regulatory authorities in other countries  that the products are both safe and effective for their respective indications 
our proprietary drug strategy is designed to address the significant risks of drug development by focusing our acquisition and development efforts on clinical stage drug candidates those in human trials 
we do  however  also undertake the acquisition and development of promising pre clinical drug candidates when we believe that the therapy is novel and or when we believe the drug candidates have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development 

table of contents our proprietary drug candidates  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table  and discussed below in further detail drug candidate target indication development status satraplatin hormone refractory prostate cancer late phase  rolling nda submission has begun metastatic breast cancer phase with taxol in non small cell lung cancer phase with radiation therapy in non small cell lung cancer phase with taxotere in advanced solid tumors phase eoquin tm superficial bladder cancer phase completed  end of phase meeting held with the fda  ind filed elsamitrucin refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma phase ozarelix formerly spi hormone dependent prostate cancer phase benign prostatic hypertrophy phase lucanthone radiation sensitizer for brain tumors and brain metastases phase renazorb tm hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease pre clinical spi adjunct to chemotherapy pre clinical spi chemotherapy induced neuropathy pre clinical while other indications have not yet been identified  some of our drug candidates may prove to be beneficial in additional disease indications as we continue to study and develop these drug candidates 
in addition  we have intellectual property rights to neurology compounds that we may out license to third parties for further development 
we believe our proprietary drug candidates have the potential to be effective therapeutic agents with some advantages over existing therapies 
our goal is to develop and commercialize many of these drugs in the united states and license the rights for japan and europe to local companies in those countries to the extent that we have rights in those territories 
overview of indications we are targeting cancer cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states  accounting for approximately of all deaths 
in its most recent annual report  the american cancer society reported that in the under age group  cancer is the leading cause of death 
in the united states  approximately million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in and over  persons are expected to die from the disease in accordingly  there is significant demand for improved and novel cancer treatments 
cancer occurs when abnormal cells divide without control 
these cells can invade nearby tissues or spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body 
five to ten percent of all 
table of contents cancers are believed to be due to inheriting a faulty gene 
the remaining to percent are believed to be caused by damage to the genes during a person s lifetime 
this damage can be caused by internal agents  such as hormones or an altered immune system  or external agents  such as viruses  exposure to chemicals or harmful ultraviolet sunrays 
sometimes ten or more years may pass between exposure and cancer detection 
cancer is currently treated by surgery  chemotherapy  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy and immunotherapy 
cancer is referred to as refractory when it has not responded or is no longer responding to a treatment 
we believe that traditional chemotherapeutic agents are likely to remain the mainstay therapy for cancer for the foreseeable future 
however  we continue to seek additional novel drugs  drug delivery methods and combination therapies that address cancer or cancer related indications with significant unmet medical need 
accordingly  we are actively seeking novel and proprietary oncology drug candidates that have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in clinical trials and or we believe have a higher probability of regulatory approval than that of a typical compound at a similar stage of development  target cancer indications with significant unmet medical need  where current treatments either do not exist or are not effective  and we believe we can acquire at a fair value based on our judgment of clinical and commercial potential 
benign prostatic hypertrophy benign prostatic hypertrophy bph is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate leading to difficulty in passing urine  reduced flow of urine  discomfort or pain while passing urine and increased frequency of urination 
enlargement of the prostate is controlled by testosterone 
according to the national institutes of health  benign prostatic hypertrophy affects more than of men over age and as many as of men over the age of treatment options for benign prostatic hypertrophy include surgery and medications to reduce the amount of tissue and increase the flow of urine 
in the month period ended june  the worldwide bph treatment market was estimated to be almost billion  and grew by approximately in fixed rate us dollar terms 
end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease hyperphosphatemia hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  affects patients with chronic kidney disease  especially end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis 
it can lead to significant bone disease including pain and fractures and cardiovascular disease  and is independently associated with increased mortality 
treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering blood phosphate levels by restricting dietary phosphorus intake  and using  on a daily basis  and with each meal  oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate before its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream 
restricting dietary phosphorus intake has historically not been a successful means of serum phosphate control  and phosphate binders are the mainstay of hyperphosphatemia management 
according to the united states renal data system s annual report and the national kidney foundation  there are an estimated  patients with end stage renal disease in the united states 
during the past decade  the end stage renal disease population is estimated to have grown by approximately annually 
we anticipate growth in the use of phosphate binders due to significant room to improve patient compliance  currently as low as for some phosphate binders  recommendations for expanded use of phosphate binders in stage and stage chronic kidney disease million patients in the united states under the revised national kidney foundation kidney disease outcomes quality initiative  or k doqi  clinical guidelines  trends in treatment toward separating control of phosphate levels from control of calcium levels  based on k doqi guidelines  creating more demand for non calcium  non aluminum phosphate binders  including lanthanum based agents  and reimbursement for oral medications for dialysis patients under a new medicare plan  beginning in currently marketed therapies for treating hyperphosphatemia include non calcium  non aluminum  non magnesium phosphate binders such as polymer based and lanthanum based phosphate binders  aluminum based phosphate binders  and calcium based phosphate binders 
under the new national kidney foundation 
table of contents k doqi guidelines  both calcium based phosphate binders and non calcium  non aluminum  non magnesium phosphate binders are recommended as first line or long term therapy for the management of hyperphosphatemia 
however  the current therapies require large number of large pills to be chewed or swallowed along with each meal  leading to problems with patient compliance with the treatment regime 
spectrum s drug  if successful  is likely to avoid some of the patient compliance related issues 
our proprietary drug candidates satraplatin satraplatin  an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapy agent  is being developed by our co development partner  gpc biotech ag nasdaq gpcb  as a second line chemotherapy treatment for its intended initial indication  hormone refractory prostate cancer 
in addition to hormone refractory prostate cancer  satraplatin has shown indication of anti tumor activity in solid tumors such as ovarian and lung cancer 
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in men 
according to the american cancer society  approximately  new cases and  deaths will occur in the us during the initial treatment of prostate cancer  surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy  is often non curative 
once the disease progresses after the initial hormonal treatment  it is considered hormone refractory 
for those patients with cancer that is hormone refractory  treatment currently involves chemotherapy  which is usually non curative but improves the symptoms of cancer with limited prolongation of survival 
platinum compounds continue to represent one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapeutic agents in modern cancer therapy and are typically used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various types of cancer 
worldwide sales of these drugs were in excess of billion in while the platinum compounds currently on the market are intravenously administered  satraplatin is an orally administered compound 
we believe an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapeutic agent may offer important clinical and commercial advantages over platinum compounds that need to be intravenously administered in a hospital setting  including ease of administration and patient convenience 
these advantages  in turn  could potentially lead to improved patient compliance as well as potential cost savings to patients and the healthcare system 
a pivotal phase trial  the sparc satraplatin and prednisone against refractory cancer trial for satraplatin in hrpc  was initiated by gpc biotech in september  following completion of a special protocol assessment an assessment by a special committee of the fda 
also in september  the fda granted fast track designation to satraplatin as a second line chemotherapy for patients with hrpc 
the fda s fast track programs are intended to expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
in particular  the rolling submission process enables companies that have been granted fast track designation by the fda to submit sections of the nda to the agency as they become available  allowing the review process to begin before the complete dossier has been submitted 
in february  gpc biotech received a scientific advice letter from the emea enabling the pivotal phase trial on satraplatin to proceed in europe using the sparc protocol 
enrollment of over patients  for that phase study  was completed in december of patients are now being followed up for determination of the study primary endpoint  progression free survival 
the interim efficacy analysis  being performed by the data safety monitoring board dsmb  is expected to be completed in late april a previous interim safety analysis performed by the dsmb did not reveal any safety concerns related to the drug 
data showing efficacy in patients with hrpc was presented at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco in chicago  in the data has since been published in the scientific journal oncology  volume  no 
 pages  additional data was presented at a prostate symposium in san francisco in february in december  our development partner gpc biotech began the rolling submission of a nda with the fda and the current plans are to complete the nda filing by the end of we expect that  if the 
table of contents study is successful  the fda could approve the nda before the end of and the drug could be launched for sale soon thereafter 
in december  gpc biotech licensed commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand to pharmion corporation  who expects to submit an application for european marketing authorization in  pending concurrence with the emea 
satraplatin has demonstrated anti tumor activity in other cancers  accordingly  in order to maximize its potential  the following additional studies  in addition to the sparc trial in hrpc  exploring other possible uses and indications are ongoing satraplatin in treating metastatic breast cancer  satraplatin  in combination with taxol  in treating non small cell lung cancer  satraplatin  in combination with taxotere  in treating advanced solid tumors  and satraplatin in combination with simultaneous  standard doses of radiotherapy in treating locally advanced non small cell lung cancer

eoquin tm eoquin is an anti cancer agent that becomes activated by certain enzymes present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal cells 
it is currently being developed for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer sbc  which is cancer that has not invaded the muscle of the bladder wall 
eoquin tm is the trademarked name for the drug substance apaziquone formulated for administration directly into the urinary bladder intravesical instillation 
the american cancer society estimates that there will be more than  new cases of and  deaths from bladder cancer in in the united states 
the estimated patient population with bladder cancer is over  in the united states and even greater in europe 
superficial bladder cancer accounts for to percent of all cases of bladder cancer at first diagnosis 
the initial treatment of this cancer is surgical removal of the tumor 
because of the high frequency of early recurrences of the tumor  patients are usually prescribed additional therapy to prevent or delay such recurrences 
this additional therapy generally consists of immunotherapy or chemotherapy drugs instilled directly into the bladder 
during the past years no new drugs have been introduced in the market for treatment of superficial bladder cancer 
eoquin tm is activated to a greater degree within tumor cells than in the normal bladder lining 
also  it is not absorbed in any significant amount from the bladder wall into the bloodstream and thus carries a lesser risk of harming the rest of the body 
during  we completed a multi center phase clinical trial to evaluate the level of anti tumor activity of eoquin tm as well as the safety of treatment 
the phase data has confirmed anti tumor activity against recurrent multiple superficial bladder cancer  as evidenced by thirty one of forty six patients showing a complete response after receiving six weekly treatments with eoquin tm instilled into the urinary bladder 
in clinical trials performed to date  eoquin tm has shown to be well tolerated  with no significant systemic toxicity  and local toxicity limited to temporary chemical cystitis inflammation of the urinary bladder resulting in increased urinary frequency  dysuria painful urination and hematuria blood in the urine in a few patients 
in september  we initiated a multicenter clinical study in europe  of eoquin tm in high risk superficial bladder cancer patients who risk early relapse  sometimes in the form of invasive  life threatening stages of bladder cancer 
eoquin tm was discovered in europe and all the clinical development  so far  has been carried out in the uk and the netherlands 
during  we also carried out additional preclinical studies that are required by the us fda before initiating clinical trials in the us 
in january  we had a pre ind and end of phase meeting with the fda to discuss the results of preclinical and clinical studies carried out to date and a plan for a phase registration study 
we are required to complete a pilot study in about patients before initiating a phase registrational study 
we just recently filed an ind with the fda  so we plan to conduct the pilot study and initiate the phase clinical trial before the end of 
table of contents during  we completed an investigation in animal models of apaziquone eo as a radiation sensitizer in the treatment of certain cancers 
many tumors grow under conditions of reduced oxygen tension hypoxia 
this makes them insensitive or resistant to treatment by x rays 
eo is activated in tumor cells both in normal oxygenation and in hypoxia 
the results of the investigation indicate that eo combined with irradiation slows tumor growth more efficiently than alternative treatments 
radiation therapy is an effective treatment for a number of tumors 
half of all cancer patients will receive radiation therapy during their course of treatment for cancer 
while radiation therapy is one of the most widely used treatment modalities  many tumors are hypoxic with insufficient oxygen supply and are resistant to radiation therapy 
there remains a need to improve the cure rate by radiation therapy  especially in hypoxic tumors 
one way to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy is to use a radiation sensitizer  a drug that increases the effectiveness of radiation

elsamitrucin elsamitrucin  an anti tumor antibiotic that acts as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes involved in dna replication  topoisomerase i and ii  is currently being developed for its intended initial indication  refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
by inhibiting the activity of these two key enzymes involved in dna replication  elsamitrucin is thought to lead to dna breaks that prevent the correct replication of dna and ultimately result in cancer cell death 
non hodgkin s lymphoma is a tumor arising from the lymph nodes 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  new cases and  deaths will occur from non hodgkin s lymphoma in in the united states 
in early stages  localized diseased lymph nodes can be treated with radiation therapy 
later stages of this disease are treated with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy plus radiation and highly specific monoclonal antibodies depending on the type of non hodgkin s lymphoma 
we believe elsamitrucin may prove to be an important addition to the treatment of refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma patients because it has shown activity when used alone and it is generally well tolerated with minimal myelosuppression 
we believe that this attribute could make it an ideal drug in combination therapy 
in april  we initiated a multi center  phase trial in patients with refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
in clinical trials conducted by us and previously by bristol myers squibb  elsamitrucin has also demonstrated a favorable side effect profile 
the current status of the phase trial in november  an abstract with updated interim results was published in the proceedings of the american society of hematology annual meeting 
elsamitrucin continued to demonstrate evidence of anti tumor activity against refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma and a safe and favorable side effect profile 
preliminary data is consistent with results from previous a phase trial  where patients showed an objective response 
we have expanded the scope of the trial to include patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia  for which the american cancer society estimates  new cases  and  deaths in in the united states 
we also plan to initiate additional studies in head and neck cancer and possibly other tumor types 
we are evaluating the therapeutic potential of elsamitrucin in combination with other standard agents in experimental models 
the rationale for this is the fact that elsamitrucin is has minimal toxicity to bone marrow  the main toxicity target of most anticancer agents  therefore  it may allow combinations with other drugs without a need to significantly reduce doses  which might result in improved therapeutic effects 
if these animal studies will prove positive  we will consider evaluating these combinations in cancer patients

table of contents ozarelix formerly spi ozarelix  a lhrh luteinizing hormone releasing hormone  also known as gnrh or gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist a substance that blocks the effects of a natural hormone found in the body is currently being evaluated for its intended initial indications  hormone dependent prostate cancer hdpc and benign prostatic hypertrophy bph 
we also plan to evaluate the compound for the treatment of endometriosis 
as described earlier  in connection with satraplatin  prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in men 
the initial treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy 
we believe ozarelix may prove to be an important addition in treating hormone dependent prostate cancer patients because of its ability to induce prolonged testosterone suppression in healthy volunteers as shown in early trials 
there are other lhrh antagonist and agonists a substance that mimics the effects of a natural hormone found in the body that are currently marketed or are being tested for the treatment of the indications we are pursuing 
however  we believe that ozarelix has certain advantages over other lhrh antagonists which include improved solubility  less tendency for aggregation resulting in greater bioavailability absorption by the body and minimal histamine release tendency which should reduce allergic reactions 
we also believe that ozarelix has advantages over lhrh agonists which include immediate and dose dependent suppression of sex hormones and no risk of testosterone surge or clinical flare up 
as described earlier  benign prostatic hypertrophy is a non cancerous enlargement of the prostate that is caused by testosterone 
unlike gnrh like drugs  ozarelix  which is an antagonist of gnrh  has the potential to reduce testosterone just enough to reduce both prostate size and symptoms 
endometriosis is the displacement of endometrial tissue the mucous lining of the uterus to other organs outside the womb 
endometriosis is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain and infertility in women 
at least million women in north america alone have endometriosis 
based on the stage of the disease the treatment can include hormone therapy or surgery or a combination of both 
current hormonal treatment aims to stop ovulation for as long as possible 
ozarelix is an antagonist blocker of gnrh gonadotropin releasing hormone  a hormone that provokes ovulation 
in  we initiated two phase clinical trials in hdpc and bph in europe  with the collaboration of aeterna zentaris  our licensor of ozarelix 
in august  we achieved complete enrollment for the phase trial in hdpc  ahead of schedule by more than four months 
the multicenter phase trial is designed to evaluate the effects of ozarelix on hormonal levels  in particular testosterone  as well as objective anti tumor effects 
the trial involving patients is being conducted in europe 
with enrollment now complete  we plan on reporting full results by the third quarter of in november  we achieved complete enrollment for the phase trial for bph 
the multi center clinical trial is designed to evaluate both objective parameters  such as improvement in urine flow and shrinkage of the prostate volume  as well as various symptoms of bph over a period of several months 
because ozarelix is expected to have the dual effects of shrinking the prostate and reducing the amount of testosterone  our expectation is that a single injection of ozarelix  repeated every few months  may be able to reduce the size of the prostate as well as accompanying symptoms 
with enrollment now complete  we plan on reporting full results by the fourth quarter of also  we plan to initiate a study in healthy female volunteers for endometriosis in europe in the nd or rd quarter of see business alliances zentaris gmbh for commercial terms relating to ozarelix licensing and development 
lucanthone lucanthone  an orally administered small molecule drug  has shown promise as a radiation sensitizer 
we own a license to a method of treating cancer of the central nervous system through the administration of lucanthone and radiation 
data obtained from prior studies suggests that lucanthone inhibits post radiation dna repair in tumor cells  and thus has the potential to improve the treatment outcomes in a number of human malignancies  specifically brain tumors  as it readily crosses the blood brain barrier 

table of contents lucanthone was originally used as an antiparasitic agent for the treatment of schistosomiasis in the s and s 
this drug was administered to  patients with no deaths or lasting side effects 
it was later discontinued because better antiparasitic medications became available 
dr 
robert bases  the patent inventor  recently demonstrated that although lucanthone has structural and biochemical similarities to actinomycin d  it has no haematological or gastro intestinal toxicity at clinically tolerated doses 
in trials  lucanthone was found to be safe  practical and effective and has since been proposed for use in clinical protocols for the treatment of cancer 
we plan to proceed with phase trials of lucanthone as a radiation sensitizer for treatment of brain tumors 
we are currently in the process of preparing new clinical supplies with newly manufactured api 
when supplies are ready  we will expand on the studies previously performed 
renazorb tm renazorb tm  a second generation lanthanum based nanoparticle phosphate binding agent  has the potential to address hyperphosphatemia  or high phosphate levels in blood  in patients with end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease 
please see the discussion of hyperphosphatemia above 
we believe that renazorb tm has the opportunity  because of its higher capacity for binding phosphate on an equal weight basis  to significantly improve patient compliance by offering the lowest in class dosage potentially one or two small tablets per meal to achieve the same therapeutic benefit as other phosphate binders 
in december  we met with the fda to discuss the data and registrational development plans for renazorb tm and we continue to perform preclinical development work

spi spi is an endothelinb agonist  which can stimulate receptors on endothelial cells  the innermost  simple layer of cells lining the blood vessels to selectively and transiently increase blood flow to the tumor and thereby selectively increase the delivery of anti cancer drugs to cancer tissue 
this technology takes advantage of the fact that there is differential blood supply to the tumors 
tumors get their blood supply from blood vessels which are different from normal blood vessels and which mostly lack the surrounding smooth muscle cells  and associated innervations  found in healthy tissue s blood vessels 
chemotherapy is one of the mainstays of therapy for solid carcinomas  including breast  lung  and prostate 
chemotherapy uses drugs called cytotoxic agents that are poisonous to cells to kill cancerous cells 
chemotherapy often fails because adequate and uniform distribution of the cytotoxic agents is not achieved in the tumor  while serious side effects can result from toxicity to normal cells 
consequently  any means to increase the delivery of a cytotoxic agent selectively to tumors  while minimizing its concentration in normal tissues may be very beneficial 
when anti cancer drugs  such as paclitaxel injection  are administered shortly after spi  the anti cancer drug concentration in the tumor is increased several fold 
this results in increased antitumor efficacy at a given dose of a cytotoxic agents  and might allow physicians to maximize efficacy with reduced cytotoxic agent doses with resultant decreased toxicity to the normal organs 
animal studies to date have shown that spi increases significantly blood flow in the tumor with no significant effect on blood flow in normal tissues  increases delivery of paclitaxel to tumors in experimental animals  does not affect the concentration of paclitaxel in normal tissues  nor does it slow the healthy tissues elimination of paclitaxel  and increases efficacy of paclitaxel and other drugs in a number of animal models

spi spi  a lipid suspension of leteprinim  has demonstrated  in experimental models  benefits in treating chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy nerve damage

generic drugs the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of created an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  approval process to accelerate the approval of generic drugs and foster generic competition 
while an anda application is subject to significant regulatory review and scrutiny before approval by the fda  the costs and timelines associated with the development of a generic drug and the overall timelines associated with the completion of regulatory review and subsequent commercialization of the generic drug product can be significantly shorter than the new drug application  or nda  approval process  and can be relatively less uncertain and less expensive 
as a result of the number of branded pharmaceutical products coming off patent over the next decade  combined with the aging us population and cost containment efforts by the us federal government and private insurance payers  we believe the us market for generic drugs will continue to grow 
we plan to capitalize on this growth by focusing our effort in niche categories such as injectable products and oncology drugs where the competition is not as intense and where we can leverage our resources and those of our strategic partners to create synergies with the proprietary drugs we develop 
to date  we have filed twelve andas with the fda  including those for ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection  which received fda approval in september  september and june  respectively 
we are awaiting the approval by the fda of ten andas  including one anda for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic form of glaxosmithkline gsk imitrex injection 
we believe we are the first to file for our anda  for sumatriptan succinate injection  with paragraph iv certification  and are currently in litigation with gsk over their patent for imitrex 
in addition  we plan to file additional andas in and beyond that will mostly include oncology injectables 
as mentioned above  we have entered into a strategic alliance with par to market our current  as well as certain future  generic drugs 
in addition  par shall provide both legal and financial support for the litigation with gsk regarding sumatriptan succinate injection 
we believe that this alliance completes our generic strategy  provides an excellent marketing partner for our generic products and puts us in the best position to maximize the revenue potential from our generic portfolio 
business alliances and licensing agreements strategic business alliances are an important part of the execution of our business strategy 
we currently do not own any manufacturing or distribution capabilities 
we generally direct and pay for all aspects of the drug development process  and consequently incur the risks and rewards of drug development  which is an inherently uncertain process 
to mitigate such risks and address our manufacturing and distribution needs  we enter into alliances where we believe our partners can provide strategic advantage in the development  manufacturing or distribution of our drugs 
in such situations  the alliance partners may share in the risks and rewards of the drug development and commercialization 
we have entered into product development and manufacturing  and sales  marketing and distribution alliances  for some of our drug candidates and intend to enter into additional alliances in the future 
the following represent our key business alliances product development and manufacturing gpc biotech ag gpc biotech in  in exchange for an upfront license fee and future milestones and royalties  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech for worldwide 
table of contents rights for further development and commercialization of satraplatin 
under the terms of this agreement  gpc biotech agreed to fully fund the development expenses for satraplatin 
a joint development committee establishes the development plans for satraplatin  with members from both gpc biotech and spectrum 
gpc biotech  however  represents a majority of the committee and the final procedures are effectively decided and implemented by gpc biotech 
we have the ability to perform additional studies  if so desired  at our expense 
in december  gpc biotech licensed commercialization rights for europe  turkey  the middle east  australia and new zealand to pharmion corporation 
to date  we have received  in milestone payments and  in commissions on the sale of satraplatin product to gpc biotech 
in addition  during  pursuant to the license agreement  gpc biotech made an equity investment of  to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
we are entitled to additional revenues upon achievement of specified milestones by gpc biotech and pharmion  which are generally based on developmental or regulatory events  and royalties on worldwide sales  if any  of the product 
the term of the agreement expires on a product by product and country by country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire patents granted in each country covering such product  although some obligations  such as provisions relating to confidentiality and indemnification  survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier by either party in some cases either in whole or on a product by product and or country by country basis  based upon material breach or the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other  or by gpc biotech upon six months notice to us 
johnson matthey plc in  we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to satraplatin from its developer  johnson matthey  in exchange for an upfront fee  additional payments to be made based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties based on any net sales  if any  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
each of our contingent future cash payment milestone obligations to johnson matthey is generally matched by a corresponding  greater milestone receivable from gpc biotech 
we did not have to make any cash payments to johnson matthey for the upfront fees  milestone payments and equity investments we have received so far from gpc biotech 
johnson matthey currently supplies gpc biotech with satraplatin for clinical trials  however  we  and therefore  gpc biotech  are under no contractual obligation to purchase satraplatin from johnson matthey 
the term of the agreement expires on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last to expire patents granted in each country  although some obligations  such as provisions relating to confidentiality  survive termination 
in addition  the agreement may be terminated earlier  by johnson matthey if we fail to make any milestone or royalty payments on the date due  by us at any time upon sixty days notice  or by either party upon breach of the agreement or commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the other 
nddo research foundation nddo in  we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to eoquin tm and numerous related derivates from the nddo in the netherlands  in exchange for an up front fee  additional payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if any  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
bristol myers squibb we in licensed exclusive worldwide rights to elsamitrucin from its developer  bristol myers squibb  in  in exchange for an upfront fee  additional payments based upon achievement of milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if any  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
zentaris gmbh zentaris in  we entered into a license agreement with zentaris  whereby we acquired an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ozarelix in north america and india 
our agreement also provides for profit sharing from any potential sales or licensing revenue earned by zentaris in japan 
we paid zentaris an upfront payment of million in cash and equity  and we are required to make payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones  in addition to royalties on any net sales 
zentaris retains exclusive rights to the rest of world  but will share with spectrum upfront and milestone payments  royalties or profits from potential sales in japan 
in the event zentaris  or another licensee  independently develops ozarelix for territories not licensed to us  we are entitled to receive and utilize the results of those development efforts 
with certain exceptions  we are required to purchase all finished drug product from zentaris for the clinical development of ozarelix at a set price 
the parties agreed to discuss entering into a joint supply agreement for commercial supplies of finished drug product 

table of contents altair nanotechnologies  inc in january  we entered into a license agreement with altair nanotechnologies  inc  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize renazorb tm for all human therapeutic and diagnostic uses 
we paid altair an upfront payment of  shares of restricted spectrum common stock and made an equity investment of  for  shares of altair common stock  and we are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition  we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  if any  if marketing approval is obtained from regulatory authorities 
under the terms of the agreement  altair has agreed to work to establish fda certified cgmp facilities for the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient contained in this product 
during  we conducted certain animal tests  as specified in the license agreement  upon one of the compounds licensed from altair 
prior to conclusion of those tests we became aware of certain facts that have made it difficult to conduct the development of renazorb tm as expeditiously as planned and will require us to conduct additional tests which will cause delays in the development of the drug candidate 
upon the successful conclusion of the specified tests we are obligated to issue to altair  shares of our common stock as a milestone payment 
we have a contractual dispute with altair that is in the early stages of a dispute resolution process under the auspices of the american arbitration association 
chicago labs in february  we entered into a license agreement with chicago labs  inc  whereby we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize spi for the prevention and treatment of cancer 
we paid chicago labs an upfront fee of  and we are obligated to make future payments contingent upon the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones 
in addition we will pay royalties and sales milestones on net sales  if any  after marketing approval is obtained from the fda and other regulatory authorities 
chicago labs may terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain development deadlines that may be extended by chicago labs upon our request if we demonstrate good faith efforts to meet the deadlines 
jb chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd 
jbcpl in  we formed a joint venture  neojb  llc  with jbcpl  an india based pharmaceutical manufacturer  with a view to utilizing jbcpl s existing manufacturing capabilities to produce selected oral prescription drug products for marketing in the united states 
jbcpl operates manufacturing facilities in india  which produce active pharmaceutical ingredients  intermediates building blocks in chemical compounds  finished dosage form pharmaceuticals and herbal remedies 
we own an interest in neojb  llc 
through the date of this report  we have filed four andas on behalf of the joint venture 
in september and  the fda approved our andas for ciprofloxacin tablets and fluconazole tablets  respectively  which are manufactured by jbcpl 
the joint venture purchases product from jbcpl based on market prices prevailing at the time of purchase  and does not have long term volume or price commitments 
in  jbcpl granted neojb an exclusive license to obtain regulatory approval to market and distribute certain products within the united states  including ciprofloxacin tablets and fluconazole tablets 
the agreement provides that we  or neojb  will bear all costs of regulatory approvals for the products and that jbcpl will manufacture and supply to neojb the products in such quantities as neojb may require at prices reasonably acceptable to both parties 
the agreement provides that jbcpl shall not enter into any distribution or sale arrangement or grant any license with respect to any product covered by the agreement in the united states unless it first offers to enter into a supply agreement with neojb pursuant to certain procedures and conditions 
in addition  the agreement provides that neojb shall not  for years from the later of the termination of the agreement or expiration of the applicable patents  market in the united states any products which would compete with the distribution  marketing or sale of the products covered by the agreement 
the agreement continues so long as jbcpl or any of its affiliates is a member of neojb or until jointly terminated by the parties 
fdc limited fdc in  we entered into an agreement with fdc  an india based pharmaceutical manufacturer  with a view to marketing in the united states certain ophthalmic drugs manufactured by fdc 
among other products  fdc manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain oral  ophthalmic and otic drugs at their manufacturing facilities in india  and is engaged in selling certain active pharmaceutical ingredients produced at their fda approved facilities in india into the united states market 
through the 
table of contents date of this report  we have filed four andas for ophthalmic drugs under this alliance 
we do not have long term volume or price commitments for any products  and we anticipate negotiating transfer prices for each product only after fda approval of the corresponding anda is accomplished 
either party may terminate the agreement upon failure to agree to a mutually satisfactory supply price with respect to the products  in which case fdc is prohibited from selling such products within the united states for a price less than that offered to us under the agreement 
the agreement continues until jointly terminated by the parties 
however  either party may terminate the agreement upon the failure to reach certain milestones within specified time periods 
shantha biotechnics pvt 
ltd 
shantha in  we entered into an alliance with shantha  an indian biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development  manufacture and commercialization of human healthcare products produced by recombinant technology for the detection and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases 
we are responsible for all regulatory  marketing and distribution matters in the united states for certain products currently marketed by shantha elsewhere in the world and certain other products under development by shantha 
the product candidates under evaluation for development include oncology biologics  cancer diagnostics  as well as vaccines 
however  there are no current us regulatory guidelines that allow for generic equivalents to branded biologics to be filed with the fda using an abbreviated application and review process 
the fda is working with the pharmaceutical industry at large to better understand the position of the biotech and biopharmaceutical companies regarding the issue of equivalence of biogenerics to the branded products and the equivalence of the processes used to manufacture the active biological ingredient 
until such time that the fda adopts clear guidelines covering biogenerics and or congress creates new laws and regulations that would allow for an abbreviated application  review and approval process for biogenerics we will not be in a position to move forward in the united states on the product candidates covered under this agreement 
sales  marketing and distribution through the date of this report  we have received fda approval for the marketing of three generic products 
prior to receiving such approvals  we entered into sales and distribution agreements  in and  respectively  with the lannett company and cura pharmaceuticals company 
lannett distributed our first approved drug product  ciprofloxacin tablets  and cura distributes carboplatin injection 
the agreement with lannett expired on march   and cura continues to distribute carboplatin as a semi exclusive distributor 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a strategic alliance with par pharmaceutical inc par  one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the united states  to distribute generic drugs developed by us  including sumatriptan succinate injection 
in addition to the three previously approved generics  ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection  we expect to receive fda approval for additional andas during the agreement also covers additional andas currently being developed by us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the company is responsible for the development of and regulatory filings for the generic drugs and the company will receive payments upon regulatory approval of each anda 
the agreement also provides for a share of the profits from the sale by par of the company s generic products 
in addition  par shall provide financial and legal support  including the payment of all legal expenses going forward  for the ongoing patent challenge for sumatriptan succinate injection 
within twenty four months of the effective date of the agreement  the company has the right to request par to make an equity investment in the company  which is subject to due diligence and the negotiation of definitive documents at that time 
not counting our share of the profits  if any  from sales of the generic drugs  the company could receive an aggregate of over million under the agreement if the equity investment is made and all the regulatory approvals are obtained 
we believe that this alliance completes our generic commercialization strategy  provides an excellent marketing partner for our generic products and puts us in the best position to maximize the revenue potential from our generic drug portfolio 
we have a vice president of marketing and sales and  in light of the progress of our proprietary drug candidates  we may hire additional sales and marketing personnel  as needs dictate 
we may also seek alliances with other third parties to assist us in the marketing and sale of our proprietary drug candidates 

table of contents competition the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving biotechnology and intense competition 
we expect biotechnological developments and improvements in the fields of our business to continue to occur at a rapid rate and  as a result  expect competition to remain intense 
many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
biotechnologies under development by these and other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for the diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
in the event that one or more of those programs are successful  the market for some of our drug candidates could be reduced or eliminated 
any product for which we obtain fda approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share 
competition for proprietary products competing in the branded product business requires us to identify and quickly bring to market new products embodying therapeutic innovations 
successful marketing of branded products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness  safety and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice  group practices  hospitals and academic institutions  and managed care organizations 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
unless our proprietary products are shown to have better a better safety profile  efficacy and are as cost effective  if not more cost effective  than other alternatives  they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and therefore never be successful commercially 
companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our products target include ardana bioscience  astra zeneca lp  amgen  inc  bayer ag  bioniche life sciences inc  eli lilly and co  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  ferring pharmaceuticals  neorx corporation  genentech  inc  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  sanofi aventis inc  pfizer  inc  avi biopharma  inc  chiron corp  genta inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems incorporated  mgi pharma  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  supergen  inc  shire pharmaceuticals  tap pharmaceuticals  inc  qlt inc  threshold pharmaceuticals  inc  roche pharmaceuticals  schering plough  johnson johnson and others who may be more advanced in development of competing drug candidates or are more established and are currently marketing products for the treatment of various indications that our drug candidates target 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
competition for generic products the generic drug market is price competitive and revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic drug products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents and regulatory exclusivity for brand name products expire  if a generic manufacturer has first to file status as described below under paragraph iv certification or has an authorized generic  such generic manufacturer generally enjoys a period of exclusivity with respect to other manufacturers of the generic drug  and can achieve significant market penetration 
however  as competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases  dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenues and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must develop and introduce new generic products in a timely and cost effective manner to achieve and maintain significant revenues and gross profit 
in addition to competition from other generic drug manufacturers  we face competition from brand name companies in the generic market 
many of these companies seek to participate in sales of generic products by  among other things  collaborating with other 
table of contents generic pharmaceutical companies through authorized generic programs or by marketing their own generic equivalent to their branded products 
companies that have a significant generic presence include american pharmaceutical partners  bedford laboratories  mayne  barr laboratories  sicor  inc  teva pharmaceuticals  par pharmaceutical  dr 
reddy s laboratories  ranbaxy laboratories  mylan laboratories  inc  sandoz  and watson pharmaceuticals  inc some additional competitors in the generics market include actavis pharmaceuticals  pliva  inc  impax laboratories  inc and akorn  inc  falcom pharmaceuticals and hi tech pharmacal co 
inc  the latter three who are competitors particularly in the field of generic ophthalmic drugs 
please also read our discussion of competition matters in the risk factors section of this report 
research and development from our inception through august  we devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts to early stage drug research and development 
commencing with the launch of our new business strategy in august  we eliminated early stage drug research and development and focused our research and development efforts on development of later stage drug product candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  license fees and milestone payments  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drug products  and allocations of corporate costs 
research and development expenditures  including related stock based charges  are expensed as we incur them and were approximately million in  million in  and million in patents and proprietary rights our patent  proprietary rights and andas we in license from third parties certain patent and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary products 
in particular  we have licensed patent rights with respect to satraplatin  eoquin tm  elsamitrucin  ozarelix  lucanthone  renazorb tm and spi  in each case for the remaining life of the applicable patents 
except for ozarelix  our agreements generally provide us with exclusive worldwide rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and sell the drug candidates 
under these license arrangements  we are generally responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs related to the drug candidates 
in addition  these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably exploit the underlying technology of applicable patents 
if we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements  we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products  which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business 
the protection  preservation and infringement free commercial exploitation of these patents and related intellectual property rights is very important to the successful execution of our proprietary drug strategy 
however  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
accordingly  our patents and the patents we have in licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents 
if our patent applications are not approved or  even if approved  if our patents or the patents we have in licensed  are circumvented or not upheld by the courts  our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
from time to time  we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop  manufacture and market our products 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented 

table of contents as mentioned above  we have in licensed from third parties certain patent rights related to our proprietary products 
we believe that our patents and licenses are important to our business  but that with the exception of the united states and european patents discussed in this paragraph  relating to our proprietary products  no one patent or license is currently of material importance to our business 
there are two us patents covering satraplatin  a compound patent that expires in and a medical use patent that expires in  and an issued compound patent in europe that expires in various countries between and there is a possibility  under the hatch waxman act  to obtain up to a year extension of one of the us patents for the time spent during the fda regulatory process 
there are similar extension possibilities in europe 
for eoquin tm  in the us there is a compound patent that expires in and a formulation patent that expires in both for use in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer 
we also have a patent application on file for its use as a radiation sensitizer 
in europe  there is an issued compound patent that expires in various countries in and a patent application pending for the formulation patent 
for elsamitrucin  the us and europe patents have already expired  however  we anticipate filing future us and european patent applications covering new formulations and or uses for this product 
for ozarelix  there is a us compound patent issued that will expire in for lucanthone  there is a us method of use patent that expires in for renazorb tm  there are compound patents pending in the united states and europe 
for spi  we have filed method of use patent applications in the us and europe 
for spi  there is a us compound patent that expires in and us method of use patent that expires in the us compound patent s foreign counterpart in europe expires in various countries in we are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products 
while the united states and the european union are currently the largest potential markets for most our proprietary product candidates  we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the united states and europe 
limitations on patent protection in these countries  and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the united states  may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the united states 
in addition  laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the united states 
to minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection  we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the united states  the european union  canada and japan 
in determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country  we weigh the relevant costs and benefits  and consider  among other things  the market potential and profitability  the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability  and the nature of terms with any potential licensees 
failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets 
in addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above  we have trademark protection for eoquin tm and renazorb tm 
we will likely register trademarks for the branded names of our proprietary drug products if any are approved for marketing 
in conducting our business generally  we rely upon trade secrets  know how  and licensing arrangements and use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or know how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the protection of know how is particularly important because the know how is often the necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary product candidates 
we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation concerning patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain

table of contents in connection with andas filed on behalf of jbcpl and fdc  we have the exclusive license to market and distribute those drugs within the united states  if and when approved by the fda 
we own the andas for carboplatin  sumatriptan succinate injection and our other andas 
the patent process the united states constitution provides congress with the authority to provide inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries 
congress codified this right in united states code title  which gave the patent office the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a us patent 
this process involves the filing of a patent application that teaches a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms 
the invention must be novel not previously known and non obvious not an obvious extension of what is already known 
the patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention 
the patent office undertakes an examination process that can take from one to five years  or more  depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination 
generally  the less novel an invention is  the longer the examination process will last 
in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public  the successful patent applicant is provided a right to exclude others from making  using or selling the claimed invention for a period of years from the filing date of the patent application 
under certain circumstances a patent term may be extended 
patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the drug price competition and pricing term restoration act of  or commonly known as the hatch waxman act  to recover some of the time lost during the fda regulatory process  subject to a number of limitations and exceptions 
the patent term may be extended up to a maximum of five years  however  as a general rule  the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years and approximately months for a new medical device 
only one patent can be extended per fda approved product and a patent can only be extended once 
regulatory exclusivities the fda has provided for certain regulatory exclusivities for products whereby the fda will not approve of the sale of any generic form of the drug until the end of the prescribed period 
the fda will grant a year period of exclusivity for a product that contains a chemical entity never previously approved by the fda either alone or in combination with other drugs 
in addition  the fda will grant a year period of exclusivity to a new drug product that contains the same active drug substance that has been previously approved such as a new formulation of an old drug product 
also  as an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to research the safety and efficacy of their brand name drugs for use in pediatric populations  congress enacted the food drug administration modernization act of  which included a pediatric exclusivity for brand name drugs 
this pediatric exclusivity protects drug products from generic competition for six months after their patents expire in exchange for research on children 
for example  if a pharmaceutical company owns a patent covering a brand name drug they can only exclude third parties from selling generic versions of that drug until that patent expires 
however  if the fda grants a brand named drug pediatric exclusivity the fda will not approve a generic drug company s anda and thus not allow the sale of a generic drug for six months beyond the patent term covering the brand name drug 
thus  the pediatric exclusivity effectively extends the brand named company s patent protection for six months 
this extension applies to all dosage forms and uses that the original patent covered 
paragraph iv certification in  congress enacted the hatch waxman act in part to establish a streamlined approval process for the fda to use in approving generic versions of previously approved branded drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  for each patent listed in the fda orange book  where branded companies are required to list their patents for branded products  for the relevant branded drug  an anda applicant must certify one of the following claims that there is no patent information listed  that such patent has expired  that the 
table of contents proposed drug will not be marketed until expiration of the patent  or that either the proposed generic drug does not infringe the patent or the patent is invalid  otherwise known as paragraph iv certification 
if an anda applicant files a paragraph iv certification  the hatch waxman act requires the applicant to provide the patent holder with notice of that certification and provides the patent holder with a day window  during which it may bring suit against the applicant for infringement 
if patent litigation is initiated during this period  the fda may not approve the anda until the earlier of months from the patent holder s receipt of the notice the month stay or the issuance of a final  non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of the anda  the patent holder could seek an injunction to block the launch of the generic product until the patent expires 
often more than one company will file an anda that includes a paragraph iv certification 
however  the hatch waxman act provides that such subsequent anda applications will not be approved until days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
thus  the hatch waxman act effectively grants the first filed anda holder days of marketing exclusivity for the generic product 
for more information on our anda with paragraph iv certification for sumatriptan succinate injection  please see item legal proceedings below 
please also read our discussion of patent and intellectual property matters in the risk factors section of this report 
orphan drug designation some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
the fda grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states or more than  individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the united states a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the united states for that drug 
in the united states  orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity  which means the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity 
also  competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity 
under european union medicines laws  criteria for designation as an orphan medicine are similar but somewhat different from those in the united states 
orphan medicines are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity  except under certain limited circumstances comparable to united states law 
during this period of market exclusivity  no similar product  whether or not supported by full safety and efficacy data  will be approved unless a second applicant can establish that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior 
this period may be reduced to six years if the conditions that originally justified orphan designation change or the sponsor makes excessive profits 
governmental regulation the production and marketing of our proprietary and generic drug products are subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation 
the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  as amended from time to time  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  
table of contents storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our proposed products 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework  including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to regular inspections by the fda and must comply with good manufacturing practices 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with good manufacturing practices and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in certain of such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
general information about the drug approval process the united states system of new drug approval is one of the most rigorous in the world 
only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization 
our proprietary drug strategy focuses on in licensing clinical stage drug candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
this strategic focus on clinical stage drug candidates those eligible for human trials is designed to address certain risks of drug development by shortening the timeline to marketability and reducing the risk of failure  both of which are higher with an early stage product 
the following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary drugs 
pre clinical testing during the pre clinical testing stage  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug compound against the targeted disease and the compound is evaluated for safety 
investigational new drug exemption after pre clinical testing  an application for investigation new drug exemption is submitted to the fda to begin human testing of the drug 
phase clinical trials after an investigational new drug exemption becomes effective  phase human clinical trials can begin 
these trials  involving small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients usually define a drug candidate s safety profile  including the safe dosage range 
phase clinical trials in phase clinical trials  studies of volunteer human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug s effectiveness 
these studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels  dose schedules and route s of administration  and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on humans  as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following phase phase clinical trials this phase usually involves large numbers of patients with the targeted disease 
during the phase clinical trials  physicians monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long term use of the drug on a large  more widespread  patient population 
during the phase clinical trials  the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease 
new drug application after completion of all three clinical trial phases  if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective  a new drug application is filed with the fda 
we estimate that approval of a new drug application for a cancer drug generally takes six months to three years 
fast track review the fda has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious life threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
one of our drug candidates  satraplatin  has been given a fast track designation for the hormone refractory prostate cancer indication 
phase clinical trials after a drug has been approved by the fda  phase studies are conducted to explore additional patient populations  compare the drug to a competitor  or to further study the risks  benefits and optimal use of a drug 
these studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the nda

when a company files an anda  it must make a patent certification if there are any patents covering the branded product listed in the fda s orange book 
an anda applicant must make one of four certifications that there is no patent information listed in the orange book  that the listed patent has expired  that the listed patent will expire on a stated date and the applicant will not market the product until the patent expires  or that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product 
the anda must also demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio equivalence the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug in the body is substantially equivalent to the brand name product  unless a bio equivalence waiver is granted by the fda as is normally the case with an injectable generic drug to the brand name product 
the anda drug development and approval process generally takes less time than the nda drug development and approval process since the anda process does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product 
we estimate that approval of an abbreviated new drug application generally takes one to two years 
approval if the fda approves the new drug application  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe to patients for treatment 
the marketing of a drug after fda approval is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the fda  including regulation of adverse event reporting  manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the drug 
failure to comply with fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas  andas or other product applications enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
see risks factors our failure to comply with extensive governmental regulation to which we are subject may delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and or may subject us to penalties 
the generic drug enforcement act of established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
under this act  the fda has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs 
the fda may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and or withdraw approval of an anda and seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of any pending nda  anda or other regulatory submissions under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery and illegal gratuities policy 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing 

table of contents foreign regulation whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative  provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
this authorization is a marketing authorization approval  or maa 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization  which is granted by a single european union member state  may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
this procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure  or mrp 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
we face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to our collaborators or us 
third party reimbursement and pricing controls in the united states and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
it will be time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare and private payers 
our products may not be considered cost effective  and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis 
the passage of the medicare prescription drug and modernization act of imposes new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs  which may affect the marketing of our products 
in many foreign markets  including the countries in the european union  pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control 
while we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and profitability 
employees the efforts of our employees are critical to our success 
we believe we have assembled a strong management team with the experience and expertise needed to execute our business strategy 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel as needs dictate to implement our growth strategy 
as of december   we had employees  of which five held a md degree and five held a phd degree 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we regard our relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects can be impacted by a number of factors  any one of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose a part or all of your investment 
you should carefully consider the risks described below with all of the other information included in this annual report 
failure to satisfactorily achieve any of our objectives or avoid any of the risks below would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
risks related to our business our losses will continue to increase as we expand our development efforts  and our efforts may never result in profitability 
our cumulative losses since our inception in through december  were in excess of million 
we lost approximately million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue to incur losses in the future  particularly as we continue to invest in the development of our drug product candidates  acquire additional drug candidates and expand the scope of our operations 
we have received fda approval to market three generic drug products  ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection  in the united states and recorded modest revenue in and however  we may never achieve significant revenues from sales of products or become profitable 
even if we eventually generate significant revenues from sales  we will likely continue to incur losses over the next several years 
our business does not generate the cash needed to finance our ongoing operations and therefore  we may need to continue to raise additional capital 
our current business operations do not generate sufficient operating cash to finance the clinical development of our drug product candidates 
we have historically relied primarily on raising capital through the sale of our securities and out licensing our drug candidates and technology to meet our financial needs 
while anticipated profits from the sale of generic drugs  if we are successful in generating significant revenues from generics  may help defray some of the expenses of operating our business  we believe that in order to prepare the company for continued future drug product development and acquisition  and to capitalize on growth opportunities  we may need to continue to raise funds through public or private financings 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms  if at all 
accordingly  we may be forced to significantly change our business plans and restructure our operations to conserve cash  which would likely involve out licensing or selling some or all of our intellectual  technological and tangible property not presently contemplated and at terms that we believe would not be favorable to us  and or reducing the scope and nature of our currently planned drug development activities 
an inability to raise additional capital would also impact our ability to expand operations 
clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our proprietary drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay obtaining regulatory approval 
prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our proprietary drug candidates  we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials  and to the satisfaction of the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  that each of the products is both safe and effective 
for each product candidate  we will need to demonstrate its efficacy and monitor its safety 
table of contents throughout the process 
if such development is unsuccessful  our business and reputation would be harmed and our stock price would be adversely affected 
all of our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development 
the results of pre clinical studies and early stage clinical trials of our product candidates do not necessarily predict the results of later stage clinical trials 
later stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective despite having progressed through initial clinical testing 
even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising  such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda or any other united states or foreign regulatory approval 
pre clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways 
accordingly  fda officials could interpret such data in different ways than we or our partners do  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda  other regulatory authorities  our institutional review boards  our contract research organizations  or we may suspend or terminate our clinical trials for our drug candidates 
any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates  or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates  may severely harm our business and reputation 
even if we receive fda and other regulatory approvals  our product candidates may later exhibit adverse effects that may limit or prevent their widespread use  may cause the fda to revoke  suspend or limit their approval  or may force us to withdraw products derived from those candidates from the market 
our proprietary drug candidates  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table drug candidate target indication development status satraplatin hormone refractory prostate cancer late phase  rolling nda submission has begun metastatic breast cancer phase with taxol in non small cell lung cancer phase with radiation therapy in non small cell lung cancer phase with taxotere in advanced solid tumors phase eoquin tm superficial bladder cancer phase completed  end of phase meeting held with the fda  ind filed elsamitrucin refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma phase ozarelix formerly spi hormone dependent prostate cancer phase benign prostatic hypertrophy phase lucanthone radiation sensitizer for brain tumors and brain metastases phase renazorb tm hyperphosphatemia in end stage renal disease pre clinical spi adjunct to chemotherapy pre clinical spi chemotherapy induced neuropathy pre clinical 
table of contents the development of our drug candidate  satraplatin  depends on the efforts of a third party and  therefore  its eventual success or commercial viability is largely beyond our control 
in  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech ag for the worldwide development and commercialization of our lead drug candidate  satraplatin 
gpc biotech has agreed to fully fund development and commercialization expenses for satraplatin 
we do not have control over the drug development process and therefore the success of our lead drug candidate depends upon the efforts of gpc biotech 
gpc biotech may not be successful in the clinical development of the drug  the achievement of any additional milestones such as the acceptance of a new drug application  or nda  filing by the fda  or the eventual commercialization of satraplatin 
we may not be able to obtain co promotion rights in the united states with regard to our drug candidate  satraplatin  under our co development and license agreement with gpc biotech ag which may adversely affect our ability to timely establish our own sales force in the united states  if and when we choose to do so 
pursuant to the terms of our co development and license agreement with gpc biotech  in the event gpc biotech determines to market satraplatin itself within the united states  we will have the right to co promote satraplatin in the united states with gpc biotech pursuant to terms to be negotiated by both parties 
if gpc biotech grants rights to a third party to market satraplatin in the united states  then gpc biotech is only obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain co promotion rights for us with such third party 
therefore  we may not be able to obtain co promotion rights for satraplatin in the united states  which may adversely affect our ability to timely establish our own sales force in the united states  if and when we choose to do so 
the development of our drug candidate  ozarelix  may be adversely affected if the development efforts of zentaris gmbh who retained certain rights to the product  are not successful 
zentaris gmbh licensed the rights to us to develop and market ozarelix in the united states  canada  mexico and india 
zentaris may conduct their own clinical trials on ozarelix for regulatory approval in other parts of the world 
we will not have control over zentaris efforts in this area 
and our own development efforts for ozarelix may be adversely impacted if their efforts are not successful 
from time to time we may need to license patents  intellectual property and proprietary technologies from third parties  which may be difficult or expensive to obtain 
we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to successfully develop  manufacture and market our drug products 
as an example  it may be necessary to use a third party s proprietary technology to reformulate one of our drug products in order to improve upon the capabilities of the drug product 
if we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on reasonable terms  our ability to commercially exploit our drug products may be inhibited or prevented 
the inability to retain and attract key personnel could significantly hinder our growth strategy and might cause our business to fail 
our success depends upon the contributions of our key management and scientific personnel  especially dr 
rajesh c 
shrotriya  our chairman  president and chief executive officer and dr 
luigi lenaz  our chief scientific officer 
dr 
shrotriya has been president since and chief executive officer since  and has spearheaded the major changes in our business strategy and coordinated our structural reorganization 
dr 
lenaz has been president of our oncology division from november to february and chief scientific officer since february  and has played a key role in the identification and development of our proprietary drug candidates 
the loss of the services of dr 
shrotriya  dr 
lenaz or any other key personnel could delay or preclude us from achieving our business objectives 
dr 
shrotriya has an employment agreement with us that will expire on december   with automatic one year renewals thereafter unless we  or dr 
shrotriya  give notice of intent not to renew at least days in advance of the renewal date 

table of contents dr 
lenaz has an employment agreement with us that will expire on july   with automatic one year renewals thereafter unless we  or dr 
lenaz  give notice of intent not to renew at least days in advance of the renewal date 
we also may need substantial additional expertise in marketing  pharmaceutical drug development and other areas in order to achieve our business objectives 
competition for qualified personnel among pharmaceutical companies is intense  and the loss of key personnel  or the delay or inability to attract and retain the additional skilled personnel required for the expansion of our business  could significantly damage our business 
our collaborations with outside scientists may be subject to change  which could limit our access to their expertise 
we work with scientific advisors and collaborators at academic research institutions 
these scientists are not our employees and may have other commitments that would limit their availability to us 
if a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises  we may lose their services 
although our scientific advisors and academic collaborators sign agreements not to disclose our confidential information  it is possible that some of our valuable proprietary knowledge may become publicly known through them 
we are dependent on third parties for manufacturing and marketing our proposed proprietary products 
if we are not able to secure favorable arrangements with such third parties  our business and financial condition could be harmed 
we will not manufacture any of our proposed proprietary products for commercial sale nor do we have the resources necessary to do so 
in addition  we currently do not have the capability to market our drug products ourselves 
we intend to contract with larger pharmaceutical companies to conduct such activities 
in connection with our efforts to commercialize our proposed proprietary products  we may seek to secure favorable arrangements with third parties to promote and market our proposed proprietary products 
if we are not able to secure favorable commercial terms or arrangements with third parties for marketing and promotion of our proposed proprietary products  we may choose to retain promotional and marketing rights and seek to develop the commercial resources necessary to promote or co promote or co market certain or all of our proprietary drug candidates to the appropriate channels of distribution in order to reach the specific medical market that we are targeting 
we may not be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on this or any other basis 
if we are not able to secure favorable partnering arrangements  or are unable to develop the appropriate resources necessary for the commercialization of our proposed proprietary products  our business and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  we will have to hire additional employees or consultants  since our current employees have limited experience in these areas 
sufficient employees with relevant skills may not be available to us 
any increase in the number of our employees would increase our expense level  and could have an adverse effect on our financial position 
in addition  we  or our potential commercial partners  may not successfully introduce our proposed proprietary products or our proposed proprietary products may not achieve acceptance by patients  health care providers and insurance companies 
further  it is possible that we may not be able to secure arrangements to manufacture and market our proposed proprietary products at favorable commercial terms that would permit us to make a profit 
to the extent that corporate partners conduct clinical trials  we may not be able to control the design and conduct of these clinical trials 
we may rely on contract research organizations and other third parties to conduct clinical trials and  in such cases  we are unable to directly control the timing  conduct and expense of our clinical trials 
we may rely  in full or in part  on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
in such situations  we have less control over the conduct of our clinical trials  the timing and completion of the trials  the required reporting of adverse events and the management of data developed through the trial than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff 
communicating with outside parties can also be challenging  potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities 
outside parties may have 
table of contents staffing difficulties  may undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed  adversely affecting their willingness or ability to conduct our trials 
we may experience unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control 
problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a contract research organization may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternative service provider 
however  making this change may be costly and may delay our trials  and contractual restrictions may make such a change difficult or impossible 
additionally  it may be impossible to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost 
we may have conflicts with our partners that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may have conflicts with our partners  such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data  the achievement of milestones  the interpretation of contractual obligations  payments for services  development obligations or the ownership of intellectual property developed during our collaboration 
if any conflicts arise with any of our partners  such partner may act in a manner that is adverse to our best interests 
any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following  each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates  and in turn prevent us from generating revenues unwillingness on the part of a partner to pay us milestone payments or royalties we believe are due to us under a collaboration  uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities  which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations  unwillingness by the partner to cooperate in the development or manufacture of the product  including providing us with product data or materials  unwillingness on the part of a partner to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities  initiating of litigation or alternative dispute resolution options by either party to resolve the dispute  or attempts by either party to terminate the agreement 
our efforts to acquire or in license and develop additional proprietary drug candidates may fail  which would limit our ability to grow our proprietary business 
the long term success of our strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire or in license drug candidates in addition to those drug candidates currently in our existing portfolio 
we are actively seeking to acquire  or in license  additional proprietary drug candidates that demonstrate the potential to be both medically and commercially viable 
we have certain criteria that we are looking for in any drug candidate acquisition and we may not be successful in locating and acquiring  or in licensing  additional desirable drug candidates on acceptable terms 
in addition  many other large and small companies within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry seek to establish collaborative arrangements for product research and development  or otherwise acquire products in late stage clinical development  in competition with us 
we face additional competition from public and private research organizations  academic institutions and governmental agencies in establishing collaborative arrangements for product candidates in late stage clinical development 
many of the companies and institutions that compete against us have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and greater experience in conducting business development activities 
these entities represent significant competition to us as we seek to expand our pipeline through the in license or acquisition of compounds 
moreover  while it is not feasible to predict the actual cost of acquiring additional product candidates  that cost could be substantial and we may need to raise additional financing or issue additional equity securities  either of which may further dilute existing stockholders  in order to acquire new product candidates 

table of contents we are a small company relative to our principal competitors and our limited financial resources may limit our ability to develop and market our drug products 
many companies  both public and private  including well known pharmaceutical companies and smaller niche focused companies  are developing products to treat many if not all of the diseases we are pursuing  or are currently distributing or may be developing generic drug products directly competitive to the generic drugs we intend to develop  market and distribute 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing  marketing and sales experience and resources than us 
as a result  our competitors may be more successful than us in developing their products  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing their products to consumers 
competition for branded or proprietary drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
we have eight proprietary drug candidates currently under development 
we may not be successful in any or all of these studies  or if successful  and if one or more of our proprietary drug candidates is approved by the fda  we may encounter direct competition from other companies who may be developing products for similar or the same indications as our drug candidates 
companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our products target include ardana bioscience  astra zeneca lp  amgen  inc  bayer ag  bioniche life sciences inc  eli lilly and co  ferring pharmaceuticals  neorx corporation  genentech  inc  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  bristol myers squibb company  glaxosmithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  sanofi aventis inc  pfizer  inc  avi biopharma  inc  chiron corp  genta inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems incorporated  millennium pharmaceuticals  mgi pharma  inc  supergen  inc  shire pharmaceuticals  tap pharmaceuticals  inc  qlt inc  threshold pharmaceuticals  inc  roche pharmaceuticals  schering plough  johnson johnson and others who may be more advanced in development of competing drug candidates or are more established and are currently marketing products for the treatment of various indications that our drug candidates target 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
our proprietary drug candidates may not be more effective  safer or more cost efficient than competing drugs and otherwise may not have any competitive advantage  which could hinder our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates 
any proprietary product for which we obtain fda approval must compete for market acceptance and market share 
drugs produced by other companies are currently on the market for each disease type we are pursuing 
even if one or more of our drug candidates ultimately received fda approval  our drug candidates may not have better efficacy in treating the target indication than a competing drug  may not have a more favorable side effect profile than a competing drug  may not be more cost efficient to manufacture or apply  or otherwise may not demonstrate a competitive advantage over competing therapies 
accordingly  even if fda approval is obtained for one or more of our drug candidates  they may not gain acceptance by the medical field or become commercially successful 
we are dependent on a third party to market  sell and distribute our generic products 
in february  we entered into a development and marketing agreement with par pharmaceutical companies  inc  whereby par has agreed to market  sell and distribute all of our current and certain of our future generic products 
while we have responsibility for all development activities associated with the generic drugs selected  we have certain input into the overall product selection  api supplier selection  quality and manufacturing  marketing and selling decisions for our generic drugs 
par has the ultimate responsibility for the selling and marketing of the generic drug products and therefore the success of our generic products depends upon the specific selling and marketing efforts undertaken by par 
par may not be successful in the 
table of contents marketing of any of our generic products  which may adversely affect our ability to commercially exploit our generic drug products 
intense competition from a large number of generic companies may make the marketing and sale of our generic drugs not commercially feasible and not profitable 
we will be competing against generic companies such as teva pharmaceuticals  sandoz  barr laboratories  mylan laboratories inc  watson pharmaceuticals  inc  genpharm  dr 
reddy s  ranbaxy  american pharmaceutical partners  bedford laboratories  mayne pharmaceuticals and others 
in addition  we anticipate that many foreign manufacturers will continue to enter the generic market due to low barriers to entry 
these companies may have greater economies of scale in the production of their products and  in certain cases  may produce their own product supplies  such as active pharmaceutical ingredients  or can procure product supplies on more favorable terms which may provide significant cost and supply advantages to customers in the retail prescription market 
we expect that the generic market will be competitive and will be largely dominated by the competitors listed above who will target many  if not all  of the same products for development as us 
price and other competitive pressures may make the marketing and sale of our generic drugs not commercially feasible and not profitable 
the generic drug market in the united states is extremely competitive  characterized by many domestic and foreign participants and constant downward price pressure on generic drug prices 
consequently  margins are continually reduced and it is necessary to continually introduce new products to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have only obtained regulatory approval for three of our generic drug candidates 
while we have entered into agreements with third parties to manufacture the drug products for us  given the price volatility of the generic market  we believe it is imprudent to enter into definitive agreements on transfer prices with the manufacturers of our generic drug product candidates prior to fda approval  and we do not expect to do so until we receive fda approval and are ready to begin selling the generic drug products 
our ability to compete effectively in the generic drug market depends largely on our ability to obtain transfer price agreements that ensure a supply of our generic drug products at favorable prices 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our generic drug candidates in the united states  we may not be able to complete a transfer price arrangement with the manufacturers of the drug candidates that will allow us to market the generic drug products in the united states on terms favorable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain timely approval of our generic product candidates by regulatory agencies  including the food and drug administration  may make it difficult to capture enough market share to make a profit 
if we fail to obtain approval of our andas from the fda in a timely manner  preferably before the patent and any additional exclusivity granted by the fda to the branded drug product expire  our profitability will be significantly affected due to the significant price erosion caused by the typically large number of the generic companies entering the market 
we did not obtain approval of our andas for ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection prior to the expirations of the patents and exclusivities granted by the fda to the corresponding branded products 
many other companies had received timely approval from the fda to market the products  and  therefore  there was a significant reduction in the market price for the products by the time we entered the market 
the patents and all exclusivities for our four ophthalmic products and three of our undisclosed products have previously expired two are still covered by a patent  and a number of other companies are currently selling their own generic versions of the products 
our ability to achieve a profit may be significantly harmed as we have observed significant reductions in the market prices for these products as well 
the patents for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic version of imitrex  marketed by glaxosmithkline  for which we filed an anda with paragraph iv certification in october  have not yet expired 

table of contents we may not be successful in establishing additional active pharmaceutical ingredient or finished dose generic drug supply relationships  which would limit our ability to grow our generic drug business 
long term success in the marketing of generic drugs depends in part upon our ability to maintain expand and enhance our existing relationships and establish new sources of supply for active pharmaceutical ingredients api or for the manufacture of our finished dose generic drug products 
we do not presently intend to focus our research and development efforts on developing active pharmaceutical ingredients or manufacturing of dosage form for generic drugs 
in addition  we currently have no capacity to manufacture api s or finished dose generic drug products and do not intend to spend our capital resources to develop the capacity to do so 
therefore  we must rely on relationships with api suppliers and other contract manufacturing organizations cmo s to supply our active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dose generic drug products 
we may not be successful in maintaining  expanding or enhancing our existing relationships or in securing new relationships with api suppliers or cmo s 
if we fail to maintain or expand our existing relationships or secure new relationships  our ability to sustain and expand our generic drug business will be harmed 
our supply of drug products will be dependent upon the production capabilities of contract manufacturing organizations cmo s and component and packaging supply sources  which may limit our ability to meet demand for our products and ensure regulatory compliance 
we have no internal manufacturing capacity for our drug product candidates  and  therefore  we have entered into agreements with cmo s to supply us with active pharmaceutical ingredients and our finished dose drug products  subject to further agreement on pricing for particular drug products 
consequently  we will be dependent on our cmo partners for our supply of drug products 
some of these manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states 
the manufacture of finished drug products  including the acquisition of compounds used in the manufacture of the finished drug product  may require considerable lead times 
further  with regard to our generic drug products  sales of a new generic drug product may be difficult to forecast 
we will have little or no control over the production process 
accordingly  while we do not currently anticipate shortages of supply  there could arise circumstances in which market demand for a particular generic product could outstrip the ability of our supply source to timely manufacture and deliver the product  thereby causing us to lose sales 
reliance on cmo s entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves  including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and adhering to fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  requirements  the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the cmo because of factors beyond our control and the possibility of termination or non renewal of the agreement by the cmo  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
before we can obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  our cmo facilities must pass an fda pre approval inspection 
in order to obtain approval  all of the facility s manufacturing methods  equipment and processes must comply with cgmp requirements 
the cgmp requirements govern all areas of record keeping  production processes and controls  personnel and quality control 
any failure of our third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations  including an fda pre approval inspection and cgmp requirements  could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products  delay  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of product  operation restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
glaxosmithkline filed suit in united states federal court asserting that we have infringed one of their patents for imitrex injection by filing our anda for sumatriptan injection  the generic form of imitrex injection 
this challenge may prevent us from commercializing sumatriptan until after the patent has expired and may require us to incur the significant effort of technical and management personnel 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed suit in united states federal court to prevent us from proceeding with the commercialization of our generic form of sumatriptan injection 
since patent litigation 
table of contents has been initiated  the fda will not approve our anda until the earlier of months from glaxosmithkline s receipt of our notice of anda acceptance the month stay or the issuance of a final non appealed  or non appealable court decision finding the imitrex patent we are currently challenging invalid  unenforceable or not infringed 
if the patent is found to be infringed by the filing of our anda  glaxosmithkline could seek an injunction to block the launch of our generic product until the patent expires 
this would prohibit us from obtaining the day marketing exclusivity afforded by the fda to companies who are the first to file an anda with a paragraph iv certification for a generic equivalent to a brand name product 
we believe we are the first to file an anda with a paragraph iv certification for sumatriptan injection 
our continued defense against the charge of infringement by glaxosmithkline could require us to divert significant effort of our technical and management personnel away from their regular activities in our business  which could substantially hinder our ability to conduct  advance and grow our business 
in addition  through our strategic alliance with par  par will provide us with financial and legal support and therefore  the success of our defense is dependent on their efforts as well 
risks related to our industry rapid bio technological advancement may render our drug candidates obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in connection with their development 
as a result  our drug products may never become profitable 
the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving biotechnology 
biotechnologies under development by other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
several other companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
a competitor could develop a new biotechnology  product or therapy that has better efficacy  a more favorable side effect profile or is more cost effective than one or more of our drug candidates and thereby cause our drug candidate to become commercially obsolete 
some of our drug candidates may become obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred in their development 
as a result  such products may never become profitable 
competition for patients in conducting clinical trials may prevent or delay product development and strain our limited financial resources 
many pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials in patients with the disease indications that our drug candidates target 
as a result  we must compete with them for clinical sites  physicians and the limited number of patients who fulfill the stringent requirements for participation in clinical trials 
also  due to the confidential nature of clinical trials  we do not know how many of the eligible patients may be enrolled in competing studies and consequently not available to us 
our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to the inability to enroll enough patients to complete our clinical trials 
patient enrollment depends on many factors  including the size of the patient population  the nature of the trial protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study 
the delay or inability to meet planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays or termination of the trial  which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop products 
the ability of branded competitors to successfully limit or delay competition for certain generic products through legislative  regulatory and litigation efforts  may limit our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our generic products 
in addition to competitive pressures related to price  we may face opposition from the producers of the branded versions of the generic drugs for which we obtain approval 
branded pharmaceutical companies have aggressively sought to prevent generic competition  including the extensive use of litigation 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed suit in united states federal court to prevent us from proceeding with the commercialization of our generic version of imitrex injection which action formally initiates our challenge of 
table of contents one of the patents listed by glaxosmithkline in connection with imitrex injection 
for information regarding the risks of this litigation  please see the risk factor below 
in addition  many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent  which could extend patent protection for a number of years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process  a process by which any person can submit a petition to the commissioner of the fda to issue  amend or revoke a regulation or order or take or refrain from taking any other administrative action  to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to the united states pharmacopoeia  an organization  which publishes industry  recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  and obtaining regulatory approval of new dosage strengths  dosage forms and or formulations to try and obtain regulatory exclusivities or move consumers away from the generic product 
also  branded pharmaceutical companies are selling generic versions of their own branded drugs  or authorizing other companies to sell generic versions 
this could hurt our ability to capture market share and generate profits  especially if we are granted days marketing exclusivity for one of our generic drugs 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market and sell our proprietary or generic drug candidates 
before our proprietary drug candidates can be marketed and sold  regulatory approval must be obtained from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies 
we must demonstrate to the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and abroad that our product candidates satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy 
we will need to conduct significant additional research  pre clinical testing and clinical testing  before we can file applications with the fda for approval of our product candidates 
the process of obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals is time consuming  expensive  and can be difficult to design and implement 
the review and approval  or denial  process for an application can take years 
the fda  or comparable foreign regulatory agencies  may not timely  or ever  approve an application 
among the many possibilities  the fda may require substantial additional testing or clinical trials or find our drug candidate is not sufficiently safe or effective in treating the targeted disease 
this could result in the denial or delay of product approval 
our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals 
further  a competitor may develop a competing drug or therapy that impairs or eliminates the commercial feasibility of our drug candidates 
in order to obtain approval for our generic drug candidates  we will need to scientifically demonstrate that our drug product is safe and bioequivalent to the innovator drug 
the fda may not agree that our safety and bioequivalence studies provide sufficient support for approval 
this could result in denial or delay of fda approval of our generic products 
generic drugs generally have a relatively short window in which they can be profitable before other manufacturers introduce competing products that impose downward pressure on prices and reduce market share for other versions of the generic drug 
consequently  delays in obtaining fda approval may also significantly impair our ability to compete 
our failure to comply with governmental regulations may delay or prevent approval of our product candidates and or subject us to penalties 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose many requirements on the introduction of new drugs through lengthy and detailed clinical testing and data collection procedures  and other costly and time consuming compliance procedures 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable 
table of contents fda regulations  if partners  our contract research organizations  or we fail to comply with the regulations applicable to our clinical testing  the fda may delay  suspend or cancel our clinical trials  or the fda might not accept the test results 
the fda  an institutional review board at our clinical trial sites  our third party investigators  any comparable regulatory agency in another country  or we  may suspend clinical trials at any time if the trials expose subjects participating in such trials to unacceptable health risks 
further  human clinical testing may not show any current or future product candidate to be safe and effective to the satisfaction of the fda or comparable regulatory agencies or the data derived from the clinical tests may be unsuitable for submission to the fda or other regulatory agencies 
once we submit a drug candidate for commercial sale approval  the fda or other regulatory agencies may not issue their approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
if we are delayed or fail to obtain these approvals  our business and prospects may be significantly damaged 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  we  our partners  our manufacturers  and other contract entities will continue to be subject to extensive requirements by a number of national  foreign  state and local agencies 
these regulations will impact many aspects of our operations  including testing  research and development  manufacturing  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  quality control  adverse event reporting  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our future products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could  among other things  result in fines  changes in advertising  revocation or suspension of regulatory approvals of products  product recalls or seizures  delays  interruption  or suspension of product distribution  marketing and sale  civil or criminal sanctions  and refusals to approve new products 
the discovery of previously unknown problems with drug products approved to go to market may raise costs or prevent us from marketing such product 
the later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products may result in restrictions of the product candidate  including withdrawal from manufacture 
in addition  the fda may revisit and change its prior determinations with regard to the safety and efficacy of our future products 
if the fda s position changes  we may be required to change our labeling or to cease manufacture and marketing of the challenged products 
even prior to any formal regulatory action  we could voluntarily decide to cease the distribution and sale or recall any of our future products if concerns about their safety or effectiveness develop 
our failure to comply with advertising regulations enforced by the fda and the federal trade commission may subject us to sanctions  damage our reputation and adversely affect our business condition 
in their regulation of advertising  the fda and the federal trade commission from time to time issue correspondence alleging that some advertising or promotional practices are false  misleading or deceptive 
the fda has the power to impose a wide array of sanctions on companies for such advertising practices  and the receipt of correspondence from the fda alleging these practices could result in any of the following incurring substantial expenses  including fines  penalties  legal fees and costs to comply with the fda s requirements  changes in the methods of marketing and selling products  taking fda mandated corrective action  which may include placing advertisements or sending letters to physicians  rescinding previous advertisements or promotions  and disruption in the distribution of products and loss of sales until compliance with the fda s position is obtained 

table of contents if we were to become subject to any of the above requirements  it could be damaging to our reputation  and our business condition could be adversely affected 
physicians may prescribe pharmaceutical products for uses that are not described in a product s labeling or differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda 
while such off label uses are common and the fda does not regulate physicians choice of treatments  the fda does restrict a manufacturer s communications on the subject of off label use 
companies cannot actively promote fda approved pharmaceutical products for off label uses  but they may disseminate to physicians articles published in peer reviewed journals 
if our promotional activities fail to comply with the fda s regulations or guidelines  we may be subject to warnings from  or enforcement action by  the fda 
legislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry may hurt our ability to sell our products profitably or at all 
in both the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been and may continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry in ways that could impact upon our ability to sell our products profitably 
sales of our products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations including pharmacy benefit managers and other health care related organizations 
both the federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation  rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care  including  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or the medicare modernization act  was recently enacted 
this legislation provides a new medicare prescription drug benefit beginning in and mandates other reforms 
also  the passage of the medicare modernization act reduces reimbursement for certain drugs used in the treatment of cancer 
the new benefit  which will be managed by private health insurers  pharmacy benefit managers and other managed care organizations  may result in decreased reimbursement for prescription drugs  which may further exacerbate industry wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for prescription drugs 
this could harm our ability to market our products and generate revenues 
it is possible that other proposals will be adopted 
or existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our products we are developing 
in addition  third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may not be considered cost effective  or adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments 
in addition  new court decisions  fda interpretations  and legislative changes have modified the rules governing eligibility for and the timing of day market exclusivity periods  a period of marketing exclusivity that the fda may grant to an anda applicant who is the first to file a legal challenge to patents of branded drugs 
we believe we were the first to file an anda for sumatriptan succinate injection  the generic form of glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  and are currently in litigation with glaxosmithkline regarding the patent that covers this product 
however  it is difficult to predict the effects such changes may have on our business or our current case 
any changes in fda regulations  procedures  or interpretations may make anda approvals of generic drugs more difficult or otherwise limit the benefits available to us through the granting of day marketing exclusivity 
if we are not able to exploit the day exclusivity period for our sumatriptan succinate injection anda or one of our generic product candidates that we were first to file  for any reason  our product may not gain market share  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
as part of the medicare modernization act  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of 
table of contents branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
additional government regulations  legislation  or policies may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government action that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our products and our business could suffer 
our corporate compliance program may not ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations  and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have faced lawsuits and investigations pertaining to violations of health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
while we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based upon what we believe are the relevant current best practices  we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from future lawsuits or investigations 
if any such actions are instituted against us  and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights  those actions could have a significant impact on our business  including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology or enforce our patent rights  our business could suffer 
our success with proprietary products that we develop will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for these products 
we currently have a number of united states and foreign patents issued and pending  however  we primarily rely on patent rights licensed from others 
these patents generally give us the right and or obligation to maintain and enforce the subject patents 
we cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our pending patent applications or any patent applications we may file in the future 
if our pending and future patent applications are not approved or  if approved  if such patents and the patents we have licensed are not upheld in a court of law  our ability to competitively exploit our proprietary products would be substantially harmed 
also  such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by our competitors  in which case our ability to commercially exploit these products may be diminished 
we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual protections for our unpatented  confidential and proprietary technology 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we enter into proprietary information agreements with our employees  consultants and others  these agreements may not successfully protect our trade secrets or other confidential and proprietary information 
it is possible that these agreements will be breached  or that they will not be enforceable in every instance  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets will become known or independently developed by our competitors 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  trade secrets or proprietary know how  or enforce our patents  our business  financial condition and prospects could suffer 
intellectual property rights are complex and uncertain and therefore may subject us to infringement claims 
the patent positions related to our proprietary and generic drug candidates are inherently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
although we are not aware of any infringement by any of our drug candidates on the rights of any third party  there may be third party patents or other intellectual property rights relevant to our drug candidates of which we are not aware 
third parties may assert patent or other intellectual 
table of contents property infringement claims against us with respect to our proprietary drug candidates or our generic drug products 
this could draw us into costly litigation as well as result in the loss of our use of the intellectual property that is critical to our business strategy 
intellectual property litigation is increasingly common and increasingly expensive and may result in restrictions on our business and substantial costs  even if we prevail 
patent and other intellectual property litigation is becoming more common in the pharmaceutical industry 
litigation is sometimes necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce our patent rights  including those we have licensed from others  to protect trade secrets or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of third parties 
other than the lawsuit filed against us by glaxosmithkline related to our anda for sumatriptan injection  currently no third party has asserted that we are infringing upon their patent rights or other intellectual property  nor are we aware or believe that we are infringing upon any third party s patent rights or other intellectual property 
we may  however  be infringing upon a third party s patent rights or other intellectual property  and litigation asserting such claims might be initiated in which we would not prevail or we would not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms  if at all 
all such litigation  whether meritorious or not  as well as litigation initiated by us against third parties  is time consuming and very expensive to defend or prosecute and to resolve 
in addition  if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could lose our right to develop  manufacture or sell our products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  which could harm our business  financial condition and prospects 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology we also claim  we may have to participate in interference proceedings required by the patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial costs  even if we ultimately prevail 
results of interference proceedings are highly unpredictable and may result in us having to try to obtain licenses in order to continue to develop or market certain of our drug candidates 
we may be subject to product liability claims  and may not have sufficient product liability insurance to cover any such claims  which may expose us to substantial liabilities 
we may be exposed to product liability claims from patients who participate in our clinical trials or from consumers of our products 
although we currently carry product liability insurance in the amount of at least million in the aggregate  it is possible that this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims 
further  we may not be able to maintain our existing insurance or obtain or maintain additional insurance on acceptable terms for our clinical and commercial activities or that such additional insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall 
failure to maintain sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and results of operations if claims are made that exceed our coverage 
the use of hazardous materials in our research and development efforts imposes certain compliance costs on us and may subject us to liability for claims arising from the use or misuse of these materials 
our research and development efforts involved and currently involves the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the storage  use and disposal of these materials and some waste products 
we believe that our safety procedures for the storage  use and disposal of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations 
however  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if there were to be an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  which could exceed our financial resources 
we currently maintain insurance coverage for injuries resulting from the hazardous materials we use  and for pollution clean up and removal  however  future claims may exceed the amount of our coverage 

table of contents currently the costs of complying with federal  state and local regulations are not significant  and consist primarily of waste disposal expenses 
risks related to our stock there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market 
the sale of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
any future equity issuances by us may have dilutive and other effects on our existing stockholders 
as of march   there were approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding  and in addition  security holders held restricted stock  options  warrants and preferred stock which  if vested  exercised or converted  would obligate us to issue up to approximately million additional shares of common stock 
however  we will receive over million from the issuance of all the shares of common stock upon exercise of all of the option and warranties 
a substantial number of those shares  when we issue them upon vesting  conversion or exercise  will be available for immediate resale in the public market 
in addition  we have filed a shelf registration statement that allows us to sell up to million of our securities in which approximately million remains available for issuance  some or all of which may be shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock  and all of which would be available for resale in the market 
if we were to sell the remaining million available under the registration statement as common stock at a price approximately equal to the current market price of our common stock  we would issue approximately million new shares of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could fall as a result of resales of any of these shares of common stock due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
we have financed our operations  and we anticipate that we will have to finance a large portion of our operating cash requirements  primarily by issuing and selling our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and may have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders 
these issuances would also cause our net income  if any  per share to decrease or our loss per share to decrease in future periods 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could drop 
the market price and volume of our common stock fluctuate significantly and could result in substantial losses for individual investors 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease 
in addition  the market price and volume of our common stock is highly volatile 
factors that may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease include fluctuations in our results of operations  timing and announcements of our bio technological innovations or new products or those of our competitors  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments with respect to patents and proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or others  changes in health care policy in the united states and in foreign countries  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  the pharmaceutical industry generally and general market conditions 
in addition  the market price and volume of our common stock may decrease if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
also  certain dilutive securities such as warrants can be used as hedging tools which may increase volatility in our stock and cause a price decline 
while a decrease in market price could result in direct economic loss for an individual investor  low trading volume could limit an individual investor s ability to sell our common stock  which could result in substantial economic loss as well 
during  the price of our common stock ranged between and  and the daily trading volume was as high as  shares and as low as  shares 
during through march   the price of our common stock has ranged between and  and the daily trading volume has been as high as  shares and as low as  shares 

table of contents provisions of our charter  bylaws and stockholder rights plan may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or replace current management even if doing so would benefit our stockholders  which may lower the price an acquirer or investor would pay for our stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  as amended  and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or replace our current management 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to amend our bylaws without stockholder approval  the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  the ability of members of the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board of directors  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  unless such consent is unanimous  the establishment of advance notice requirements for nomination for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
these provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay  discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business or replacing our current management  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
in december  we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed rights to purchase units of our series b junior participating preferred stock 
the rights become exercisable upon the earlier of ten days after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock or ten business days after a tender offer has commenced that would result in a person or group beneficially owning or more of our outstanding common stock 
these rights could delay or discourage someone from acquiring our business  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
we currently have no stockholders who own or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future

table of contents item legal proceedings sumatriptan succinate injection paragraph iv litigation in october  we filed with the fda an anda for sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture  sale  and use of the sumatriptan succinate injection product in the united states 
sumatriptan succinate is marketed by glaxosmithkline under the brand name imitrex and is used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes in adults 
glaxosmithkline has two patents for sumatriptan succinate injection listed in the fda s orange book  which is the fda s listing of approved drug products 
the exclusivity afforded the two patents listed in the orange book for imitrex injection will expire on june  and february   respectively  in each case including extensions for pediatric exclusivity 
our anda includes a paragraph iv certification that the later to expire patent associated with glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  is invalid  unenforceable and will not be infringed by our generic product candidate 
on february   glaxosmithkline filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the district of delaware  alleging infringement of the patent on imitrex 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  the fda is stayed from approving our anda until the earlier of a final  non appealed or non appealable court decision finding the patent invalid  unenforceable or not infringed or the expiration of the month period that began with glaxosmithkline s receipt of our notice of anda acceptance 
often more than one company will file an anda that includes a paragraph iv certification 
however  the hatch waxman act provides that such subsequent anda applications will not be approved until days after the earlier of the date of the first commercial marketing of the first filed anda applicant s generic drug or the date of a decision of a court in an action holding the relevant patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
thus  the hatch waxman act effectively grants the first filed anda holder days of marketing exclusivity for the generic product 
we believe that our anda was the first filed anda containing a paragraph iv certification in connection with sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml 
if the filing of our anda is found to infringe a valid and enforceable patent  glaxosmithkline could seek an injunction to block the launch of our generic product until the patent expires 
while it is not possible to determine with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of the foregoing legal proceedings  we believe that we have substantial meritorious basis for our paragraph iv challenge of glaxosmithkline patent for sumatriptan succinate injection mg ml 
fact discovery is complete and expert discover is scheduled to be completed on may  trial is set on november  pursuant to our agreement with par  par shall provide financial and legal support  including payment of legal expenses going forward  for the sumatriptan litigation

overview spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in the business of acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drug products for various indications 
while we own patent rights to certain product candidates  the drug products we are currently developing  which are focused on the treatment of cancer and other unmet medical needs  are in licensed from third parties whereby we acquired exclusive rights to develop and commercialize those compounds in territories specified in the agreements 
we are also actively seeking fda approval for marketing generic versions of branded drugs whose patent protection has either already expired  or is scheduled to expire in the foreseeable future 
we currently have three generic products approved by the fda for marketing in the united states  ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets  and carboplatin injection 
in addition  we have a few neurology compounds that we may out license to third parties for further development 
new drug development is an inherently uncertain  lengthy and expensive process 
we focus our research and development efforts principally on clinical stage drug candidates  for which the primary expenses relate to the conduct of clinical trials necessary to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries  that the products are both safe and effective in their respective indications and that they can be produced by a validated consistent manufacturing process 
the number  size  scope and timing of the clinical trials necessary to bring a product candidate to development completion and commercialization cannot readily be determined at an early stage  nor  given the timelines of the trials extending over periods of years  can future costs be estimated with precision 
while generic drug development is also subject to approval by regulatory authorities  the costs and timelines of development completion and commercialization can be significantly shorter  and compared to new drug development  relatively less uncertain and less expensive 
business outlook our primary business focus for  and beyond  will be to continue to acquire  develop and commercialize a portfolio of marketable prescription drug products with a mix of near term and long term revenue potential 
as of the date of filing this report  we had eight proprietary drug product candidates under development satraplatin  eoquin tm  elsamitrucin  ozarelix  lucanthone  renazorb tm  spi and spi key developments anticipated in are satraplatin funding for worldwide satraplatin clinical trials is being borne entirely by our co development partner gpc biotech and its new sublicensee  pharmion corporation 
patient accrual in a phase clinical trial was completed in december interim analysis of the phase data is anticipated to be announced in late april also in december  gpc biotech commenced a rolling nda filing with the fda 
completion of a full nda filing is expected by the end of eoquin tm in early  we held a pre ind and end of phase meeting with the fda and recently filed an ind with the fda  with the view to initiating phase trials in the united states in the nd half of to evaluate eoquin tm in superficial bladder cancer 

table of contents ozarelix we expect results from the hdpc and bph phase trials that completed accrual in late  in the second half of based on those results we will determine the next regulatory and clinical steps 
also  we plan to initiate a study in healthy female volunteers for endometriosis in europe in the second half of elsamitrucin the multicenter  phase clinical trial in refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukemia is proceeding as planned 
based on the results of that trial we will determine the next regulatory and clinical steps 
also  during  we expect to initiate a phase study of elsamitrucin in head and neck cancer  and pilot combination studies 
we plan to continue to fund the development  including clinical trials  of lucanthone in a phase clinical trial  and three preclinical drug candidates  renazorb tm  spi and spi we expect to continue to evaluate additional promising drug product candidates for acquisition or license 
we have recorded only modest revenues to date from generic product sales  due primarily to our late entry into the market for each of our approved generic drugs 
we are unable at this time to reliably estimate recurring revenues or profits from these generic products in the foreseeable future 
we have observed significant price declines in the marketplace for each of our marketed products  due to the fda s approval of several competing andas  and the resultant glut of product introduced on and after the generic product launch dates 
we continue to explore sales opportunities for our products and believe that after the market absorbs the initial product glut  we may be in a position to realize at least modest revenues from these products 
if we are successful in our patent challenge for sumatriptan succinate injection  and obtain day marketing exclusivity as the only generic version of this product  the resulting revenues could be significant 
we recently entered into a strategic alliance with par for the marketing of our current as well as certain future generic drugs 
in addition  par shall provide financial and legal support  including payment of legal expenses going forward  for the litigation regarding sumatriptan succinate injection 
with three generic drugs already approved and additional approvals expected this year  we hope to see success from the sale of these drugs in financial condition liquidity and capital resources our current business operations do not generate sufficient operating cash to finance the clinical development of our drug product candidates 
our cumulative losses  since inception in  through december   have exceeded million 
we expect to continue to incur significant additional losses as we implement our growth strategy of developing marketable drug products for at least the next several years unless they are offset  if at all  by licensing revenues under our out license agreement with gpc biotech or from the out license of any of our other proprietary products and any profits from the sale of generic products 
we believe that the approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we had on hand as of december   will allow us to fund our current planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
our long term strategy is to generate profits from the sale and licensing of propriety drug products 
in the next several years  we anticipate supplementing our cash position with licensing and royalties revenues under our out license agreement with gpc biotech  licensing revenues from out licensing our other proprietary products and milestone profits from the sale of our generic products by par 
under the agreement with par  not counting our share of the profits from sales of the generic drugs  the company could receive an aggregate of over million under the agreement if the equity investment is made and all the regulatory approvals are obtained 
if gpc biotech successfully completed the filing of the nda in late  as planned  we will realize significant revenues in from licensing milestones specified in the agreement 
however  if we are unable to generate the necessary revenues to finance our operations long term  we may have to seek additional capital through the sale of our equity 
our operations have historically been financed by the issuance of capital stock 
to this effect  we have a shelf registration statement with approximately million available for the sale of our securities 
in addition  we could receive a significant 
table of contents amount of cash from the exercise of outstanding warrants and options  if the price of our common stock appreciates 
it is generally difficult to fund pharmaceutical research and development via borrowings due to the significant expenses involved  lack of revenues sufficient to service debt and the significant inherent uncertainty as to results of research and the timing of those results 
as described elsewhere in this report  including item a risk factors  our drug development efforts are subject to the considerable uncertainty inherent in any new drug development 
due to the uncertainties involved in progressing through clinical trials  and the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval and in establishing collaborative arrangements  among other factors  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and ultimate aggregate cost of developing each of our drug product candidates  and are similarly unable to reasonably estimate when  if ever  we will realize material net cash inflows from our proprietary drug product candidates 
accordingly  the following discussion of our current assessment of the need for cash to fund our operations may prove too optimistic and our assessment of expenditures may prove inadequate 
our expenditures for research and development and general and administrative expenses consist of direct product specific costs and non product specific  or indirect  costs 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months our total costs will average in a range between approximately and million per quarter 
the following describes our current assessment of direct  or product specific development costs  such as upfront license fees  milestone payments  active pharmaceutical ingredient api  clinical trials  patent related legal costs  and product liability insurance  among others  for each significant proprietary product  and generics as a group  currently under development 
these costs are subject to uncertainties inherent in new drug development 
additionally  we may shift our cash resources between products 
therefore  what we actually spend to develop a particular product may not fall within the estimated range and the estimated ranges may change from quarter to quarter based upon changes in priorities or strategy and or the results of the development 
while we do not receive any funding from third parties for research and development we conduct  our estimated costs could be mitigated should we enter into co development agreements for any of our drug product candidates 
satraplatin the costs of conducting clinical trials worldwide are being borne entirely by our co development partner gpc biotech and its new sublicensee  pharmion corporation 
while we have licensed the development of satraplatin to gpc biotech  we are not obligated to reimburse gpc biotech for development costs they incur or to refund any license or milestone payments we receive 
eoquin tm through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately million on the development of eoquin tm  including approximately million during the year ended december  estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the outcome of continuing discussions with the fda regarding our planned phase clinical trial 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
ozarelix through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately million in cash and equity on the acquisition of ozarelix in  and approximately million on the development of the compound in estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the results from the analysis of the phase study data  expected in the nd half of  and the initiation of a study in healthy female volunteers for endometriosis in europe in the nd or rd quarter of this year 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
elsamitrucin through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately million on the development of elsamitrucin  including approximately million during the year ended december  estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the completion of enrollment in the phase clinical trial and positive results from the analysis of the phase study data  expected in the first half of as well as the initiation of a phase study of elsamitrucin in head and neck cancer  
table of contents and other pilot combination studies 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
lucanthone through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we incurred less than  on the development of lucanthone in the year ended december  estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the timing of the continuation of the phase clinical trial 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
renazorb tm through december   excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent approximately million in cash and equity on the acquisition and development of renazorb tm in estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the results of our preclincal work and the initiation of any clinical trials 
in addition  we are currently in a contractual dispute with altair that is being handled under the dispute resolution process provided for in the license agreement 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
spi excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent less than  in cash on the acquisition and development of spi in estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the results of our preclincal work and the initiation of any clinical trials 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
spi excluding indirect costs described earlier  we have spent less than  in cash on the development of spi in estimated expenditures for the next twelve months are subject to considerable uncertainty  and are largely dependent on the results of our preclincal work and the initiation of any clinical trials 
we anticipate that over the next twelve months we may incur development costs up to approximately million 
generic drugs during the year ended december   we spent approximately million for the advancement of our generic drugs  including costs for products for which we anticipate filing andas in the future 
over the next twelve months we expect to incur additional costs up to approximately million 
we do not receive any funding from third parties for research and development we conduct for generic products  nor do we pay our generic alliance partners for any research and development they incur in the development of andas for regulatory approval 
in addition to the foregoing drug product candidates  we continually evaluate proprietary products for acquisition 
if we are successful in acquiring rights to additional products  we may pay up front licensing fees in cash and our research and development expenditures would increase 
under our various existing licensing agreements we are contingently obligated to make cash milestone payments 
in connection with the development of certain in licensed drug products  we anticipate the occurrence of certain of these milestones over the next eighteen months 
upon successful achievement of these milestones  we will likely become obligated to pay up to approximately million in cash and issue approximately  restricted shares of our common stock during the eighteen month period 
net cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  and  the net cash used in operations was approximately and million  net of interest income of approximately and million  respectively 
the increase of approximately million is due to an increase in in operating expenses  primarily research and development  substantially offset by increases in interest income  accrued clinical study costs and revenues 
based on our current plans and the scope of our activities  our anticipated use of cash for operations for all of  excluding the cost of in licensing any additional drug products  is expected to average between 
table of contents approximately million and million per quarter 
our cash expenses may increase or decrease beyond this range depending on the results of the ongoing clinical trials and research and development activity 
net cash provided by and used for investing activities during the year ended december   we invested our funds primarily in short term treasury securities and money market accounts resulting in conversion of approximately million of marketable securities into cash and cash equivalents 
we also paid altair nanotechnologies  inc  in cash in license fees and an equity investment in connection with the in licensing of renazorb tm 
the fair value of altair common stock received  approximately  at the time of the investment  was recorded as a long term investment and the remaining amount of  was charged as research and development expense for the year ended december  net cash provided by and used for financing activities net cash provided by financing activities  approximately million  for the year ended december   was comprised of approximately million from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our september financing  million from the exercise of outstanding warrants for  shares of our common stock  and from the exercise of stock options for  shares of our common stock  and  received as an equity investment for the issuance of  restricted shares of our common stock upon our achievement of a milestone under our joint venture agreement with jb chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimation process requires assumptions to be made about future events and conditions  and as such  is inherently subjective and uncertain 
actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including cash requirements  by assessing planned research and development activities and general and administrative requirements  required clinical trial activity  market need for our drug candidates and other major business assumptions 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of our judgment 
we consider the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
stock based charges in estimating the fair value of stock based compensation  we use the quoted market price of our common stock for stock awards  and the black scholes option pricing model for stock options and warrants 
we estimate future volatility based on past volatility of our common stock  and we estimate the expected length of the option on several criteria  including the vesting period of the grant  and the expected volatility 
in estimating the fair value of restricted common stock we issue in connection with licensing transactions  we apply a discount for the marketability restrictions calculated after considering past volatility of our common stock as well as the term of restriction and the cost of risk free capital for a period that is comparable with the term of the restriction on the shares 

table of contents cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consist of bank checking deposits  short term treasury securities  and institutional money market funds  but from time to time also include corporate debt and equity  municipal obligations  including market auction debt securities  government agency notes  and certificates of deposit 
we classify highly liquid short term investments  with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of days or less at the time of acquisition  as cash and cash equivalents 
other investments  which do not meet the above definition of cash equivalents  are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale marketable securities  in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as long term investments 
patents and licenses we own or license all the intellectual property that forms the basis of our business model 
we expense all licensing and patent application costs as they are incurred 
revenue recognition license fees representing non refundable payments received upon the execution of license agreements are recognized as revenue upon execution of the license agreements where we have no significant future performance obligations and collectibility of the fees is assured 
milestone payments  which are generally based on developmental or regulatory events  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  collectibility is assured  and we have no significant future performance obligations in connection with the milestones 
in those instances where we have collected fees or milestone payments but have ongoing future obligations related to the development of the drug product  revenue recognition is deferred and amortized ratably over the period of our future obligations 
revenue from sales of product is recognized upon shipment of product when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  and provisions for estimates  including promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
such revenue is recorded  net of such estimated provisions  at the minimum amount of the customer s obligation to us 
we state the related accounts receivable at net realizable value  with any allowance for doubtful accounts charged to general operating expenses 
research and development research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  license fees and milestone payments  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drug products  and allocations of corporate costs 
we expense all research and development activity costs in the period incurred 
accounting for stock based employee compensation at december   we had three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k

 accounting for stock based compensation  we account for grants pursuant to those plans under the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based employee compensation cost is recorded when the exercise price is equal to  or higher than  the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for all grants to consultants  and for those grants to employees where the exercise prices are below the market price of the underlying stock at the measurement date of the grant

we expect to adopt the provisions of statement no 
r when it becomes a mandatory requirement  currently expected to be january  the adoption of this statement is expected to result in significantly higher reported operating expenses in our future financial statements 
had we adopted the provisions of statement no 
r as of january   our reported loss for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher  or approximately million  as disclosed above in note  accounting for stock based employee compensation 
results of operations results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal in  we incurred a net loss of approximately million compared to a net loss of approximately million in the increase of approximately million in the net loss was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in research and development expense 
as of december   the fda has approved three of our generic products  ciprofloxacin tablets  fluconazole tablets and carboplatin injection  for sale in the united states 
we recorded  and  of product sales during the years ended december  and  respectively  with cost of product sold being approximately  and  respectively 
the profit margin earned during the period is not considered representative of future margins  if any 
future product sales are dependent on our distributors reordering the product from us 
in view of the extremely competitive market for each of our currently approved products and future approved products  we are unable to assess their future revenue potential 
also  during and  we recorded  and  respectively  of revenues representing amounts received from the gpc biotech under our license agreement for commissions on drug products used by gpc biotech in clinical trials 
we had no performance obligations or incurred costs in connection with this revenue 
the timing and amount of future commissions is neither predictable nor assured 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in  primarily due to the increasing scope of our drug development activities 
during  the principal clinical study costs related to a phase trial on eoquin tm 
in  we incurred costs related to multiple phase clinical trials on eoquin tm  elsamitrucin and ozarelix  and costs in advancing the development of spi and newly acquired compounds  renazorb tm  spi and lucanthone 
we expect continued increases in research and development expenses in and beyond as we develop and expand our product portfolio 
principal components of the increase in are an increase of million in direct development expenses  resulting from an expansion in the number and scope of our clinical trials and other research and development activity 
an increase of million in r d personnel costs  and an increase of million in patent related legal expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in  primarily due to an increase in legal expense in connection with the litigation regarding our patent challenge of glaxosmithkline s imitrex injection  described elsewhere in this report 
stock based charges increased by approximately  from  in to  in  primarily due to an increase in the amortization of stock based deferred compensation 
we believe the use of stock options and similar equity based awards is crucial for an early stage company like ours  as a means to conserve cash and to retain and motivate high performance employees and consultants 
we believe that such 
table of contents equity awards foster an alignment of employee and consultant interests with those of our stockholders 
we expect stock based charges to become increasingly significant to us 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
the adoption of this statement will result in significantly higher reported operating expenses in our future financial statements 
had we adopted the provisions of statement no 
r as of january   our reported loss for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher  or approximately million 
we intend to adopt the provisions of statement no 
r when it becomes a mandatory requirement  currently expected to be january  other income consisted of net interest income of approximately million for and approximately for the increase of approximately million is attributable to significantly higher investable funds and increasing interest rates in results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal in  we incurred a net loss of approximately million compared to a net loss of approximately million in the increase of approximately million was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in research and development expenses including approximately million in cash for the acquisition of ozarelix and a decrease of million in licensing revenues from these increases in net loss were offset by the non recurrence in of a non cash charge in of approximately million stock options expense  which charge arose due to timing delays in awarding stock options to employees as a result of our compliance with state securities laws during a period where our stock price rose rapidly 
we recorded  of revenues in and million revenues in the year ended december  the revenue in primarily represents  of product sales revenue  recorded from the first shipment of ciprofloxacin tablets  after receipt of fda approval in september  and represents the cash received by us 
the cost of the product sold was  also  in we received  from gpc biotech under our co development license agreement  representing commissions on drug products used by gpc biotech in clinical trials 
in connection with the revenue from gpc biotech  we had no performance obligations or incurred costs 
the revenue in was derived from the second licensing fee of million under the licensing agreement with gpc biotech  which became due in september upon dosing of the first patient in a registrational study 
future revenues from gpc biotech are dependent upon the occurrence of milestones specified in the agreement 
no milestone event occurred during research and development expenses increased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in  primarily due to a cash payment of million for the up front licensing fee for ozarelix  and an approximate million increase in drug product expense as a result of the investigation and development of additional new products  and increased clinical trials activity for eoquin tm and elsamitrucin 
other notable increases in expenses over the comparative reporting period in  were personnel costs of approximately  insurance costs of approximately  and patent related legal expenses of approximately  which were partially offset by a reduction in rent expense of approximately  due to the termination of a lease on a research facility 
these cost increases were the result of the increasing scope of our drug development activities 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  from approximately million in to approximately million in  primarily due to legal and professional fees  excluding financing related fees charged against the proceeds of the financing  and sec reporting and compliance costs increased by approximately  in due primarily to the changes in our organization  compliance with new nasdaq  sec and sarbanes oxley act of rules and regulations  and evaluation of business alliances and opportunities in conjunction with expanding our product portfolio  personnel costs  excluding the severance charge of approximately  increased by approximately  due to the hiring of additional personnel to enable us to implement our planned growth  and

contractual and commercial obligations the following table summarizes our contractual and other commitments  including obligations under a facility lease and equipment leases  as of december  payment due by period less than after total year years years years amounts in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent milestone obligations total the table of contractual and commercial obligations excludes contingent payments that we may become obligated to pay upon the occurrence of future events whose outcome is not readily predictable 
such significant contingent obligations are described below under employment agreements 
as of december   we had no capital lease obligations 
the operating lease obligations are primarily the facility lease for our corporate office  which extends through june purchase obligations represent the amount of open purchase orders and contractual commitments to vendors  for products and services that have not been delivered  or rendered  as of december  milestone obligations are payable contingent upon successfully reaching certain development and regulatory milestones as further described below under licensing agreements 
while the amounts included in the table above represent all of our potential cash development and regulatory milestone obligations as of december   given the unpredictability of the drug development process  and the impossibility of predicting the success of current and future clinical trials  the timelines estimated above do not represent a forecast of when payment milestones will actually be reached  if at all 
rather  they 
table of contents assume that all development and regulatory milestones under all of our license agreements are successfully met  and represent our best estimates of the timelines 
in the event that the milestones are met  we believe it is likely that the increase in the potential value of the related drug product will significantly exceed the amount of the milestone obligation 
licensing agreements each of our proprietary drug product candidates is being developed pursuant to license agreements  which provide us with exclusive rights to certain territories to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and sell the drug product candidates 
with regard to one of our drug product candidates  satraplatin  we have out licensed our rights to gpc biotech ag 
we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the drug product candidates  are generally responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs  and are contingently obligated to make milestone payments to the licensors if we successfully reach development and regulatory milestones specified in the agreements 
in addition  we are obligated to pay royalties and milestone payments based on net sales  if any  after marketing approval is obtained from regulatory authorities 
we have no similar milestone or other payment obligations in connection with our generic drug products 
the potential contingent development and regulatory milestone obligations  aggregating approximately million as of december   under all our licensing agreements  are generally tied to progress through the fda approval process  which approval significantly depends on positive clinical trial results 
the following list is typical of milestone events commencement of phase clinical trials  filing of new drug applications in the united states  europe and japan  and approvals from those regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainty of the drug development process  we are unable to predict with any certainty when any of the milestones will occur and  accordingly  the milestone payments represent contingent obligations that will be recorded as expense when the milestone is achieved 
in connection with the development of in licensed drug products  we anticipate certain milestones will be achieved over the next eighteen months 
if the anticipated milestones are achieved  we will likely become obligated to issue approximately  restricted shares of our common stock and pay up to approximately million in cash during the eighteen month period 
if we reach a milestone  it will likely occur prior to revenues being generated from the related compound 
however  in connection with the milestone obligations related to satraplatin  each of our contingent future payment obligations is generally matched by a corresponding  greater milestone payment obligation of gpc biotech to us 
service agreements in connection with the research and development of our drug products  we have entered into contracts with numerous third party service providers  such as clinical trial centers  clinical research organizations  data monitoring centers  and with drug formulation  development and testing laboratories 
the financial terms of these agreements are varied and generally obligate us to pay in stages  depending on achievement of certain events specified in the agreements  such as contract execution  reservation of service or production capacity  actual performance of service  or the successful accrual and dosing of patients 
as of each period end  we accrue for all non cancelable installment amounts that we are likely to become obligated to pay 
employment agreements we have entered into employment agreements with two of our executive officers  dr 
shrotriya  chief executive officer  and dr 
lenaz  chief scientific officer  expiring december  and july   respectively 
the employment agreements automatically renew for a one year term unless either party gives written notice at least days prior to the commencement of the next year of such party s intent not to renew the agreement 
the agreements require each executive to devote his full working time and effort to the business and affairs of the company during the term of the agreement 
the agreements provide for an annual base salary with annual increases  periodic bonuses and option grants as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors 

table of contents each officer s employment may be terminated by us with or without cause  as defined in the agreement 
the agreements provide for certain guaranteed severance payments and benefits if the officer s employment is terminated without cause  if the officer s employment is terminated due to a change in control or is adversely affected due to a change in control and the officer resigns or if the officer decides to terminate his employment due to a disposition of a significant amount of assets or business units 
the guaranteed severance payment includes a payment equal to the officer s annual base salary and other cash compensation  and any approved bonus 
the officer is also entitled to medical  dental and other benefits for two years following termination 
in addition  all options held by the officer shall immediately vest and will be exercisable for one year from the date of such termination 
however  if the board determines that the officer s employment is being terminated for the reason that the shared expectations of the officer and the board are not being met  then the options currently held by the officer will vest in accordance with their terms for up to one year after the date of termination  with the right to exercise those options  when they vest  for approximately thirteen months after the date of termination 
the agreements also provide that  upon his retirement  all options held by the officer will become fully vested 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and credit risk on our cash equivalents and marketable securities  which investments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we do not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
our primary exposures relate to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio  and credit risk of the companies bonds in which we invest 
we manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with our cash requirements 
our investments as of december  are primarily in short term government securities and money market accounts 
because of our ability to redeem these investments at par with short notice  changes in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of these investments 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   any decline in the fair value of our investments would not be material 
in addition  we are exposed to certain market risks associated with credit ratings of corporations whose corporate bonds we may purchase from time to time 
if these companies were to experience a significant detrimental change in their credit ratings  the fair market value of such corporate bonds may significantly decrease 
if these companies were to default on these corporate bonds  we may lose part or all of our principal 
we believe that we effectively manage this market risk by diversifying our investments  and selecting securities that generally have third party insurance coverage in the event of default by the issuer 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to payments we make to vendors and suppliers using foreign currencies 
in particular  we have foreign expenses associated with our ongoing clinical studies in europe  where some of our obligations are incurred in euros 
although fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on our payment obligations  such fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for  and in the past  we have not hedged against this foreign currency risk  however  expect to do so in future as a greater portion of our expenditures are expected to be stated in foreign currency
