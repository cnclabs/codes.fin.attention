item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company building an oncology business by developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer 
with our collaborators  we are developing small molecule drugs with the goal of changing the way cancer is treated tm 
a common feature of cancer cells is the excessive activation of signaling pathways that cause abnormal cell proliferation 
in addition  tumors require oxygen and nutrients from newly formed blood vessels to support their growth 
the formation of these new blood vessels is a process called angiogenesis 
we are applying our expertise to develop oral anticancer therapies designed to prevent cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis by inhibiting proteins that signal or support tumor growth 
by exploiting the genetic differences between cancer cells and normal cells  we aim to create novel anticancer agents that minimize damage to healthy tissue 
our lead product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  being developed with our collaborator  bayer pharmaceuticals corporation  or bayer  was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in december for the treatment of individuals with advanced kidney cancer 
this approval marked the first newly approved drug for patients with this disease in over a decade 
nexavar is a novel  orally available multi kinase inhibitor and is one of a new class of anticancer treatments that target growth signaling 
in august  we received the third milestone advance from bayer for million in connection with the filing of the new drug application  or nda  for nexavar 
in january  we received the fourth and final million milestone advance from bayer as a result of the fda approval 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
also in november  the underwriters for the offering exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of our common stock to cover over allotments at a price of per share 
we received aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million from this public offering 
on march   we and bayer entered into a co promotion agreement to co promote nexavar in the united states 
this agreement supersedes those provisions of the original collaboration agreement that relate to the co promotion of nexavar in the united states between bayer and us 
outside of the united states  the terms of the collaboration agreement continue to govern 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement and consistent with the collaboration agreement  we will share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar worldwide  excluding japan 
please read note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and potentially increasing losses for the foreseeable future  due to expenses associated with the continuing development and commercialization of nexavar 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients with advanced kidney cancer  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in included assumptions used in the determination of stock based compensation related to all stock options granted 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
stock based compensation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of all stock options granted 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility and stock option exercise behavior 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of evolving accounting standards related to accounting for stock based compensation 
we expect to continue to use the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation expense 
however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and stock option exercise behaviors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
research and development expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately percent in  percent in and percent in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
such amounts are recorded based on invoices and other information we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
in addition  research and development costs incurred by us and reimbursed by bayer are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue 
total revenue was million in   in  and zero in total revenue in represented a payment from shanghai sunway biotech co 
ltd 
in exchange for the transfer to shanghai sunway of the intellectual property and know how related to onyx we have no ongoing performance obligations under this agreement 
total revenue in of  represented a milestone payment from warner lambert  now a subsidiary of pfizer inc  when they initiated phase i clinical testing advancing a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
we had no revenue in nexavar was approved in late december and product revenue  if any  will likely fluctuate from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter and from year to year  and is difficult to predict 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or percent  from in  the increase in research and development expenses were primarily driven by a million increase in onyx s share of codevelopment costs for the nexavar program  principally for the clinical trial program which included the expanded access program in the phase iii kidney cancer trial initiated in the second quarter of in addition  nexavar development costs reflect the ongoing pivotal phase iii kidney cancer trial  a phase iii trial in liver cancer initiated in the first quarter of and a phase iii trial in metastatic melanoma initiated in may  as well as several phase ib and ii clinical trials 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million from the therapeutic virus program  which was terminated in research and development expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or percent  from the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in onyx s share of codevelopment costs for the nexavar program  which expanded into the phase iii kidney cancer trial in the fourth quarter of this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million of expenses from the therapeutic virus program 
it is anticipated that research and development expenditures will continue at levels or increase as we continue with our clinical trials of nexavar and as we add additional phase iii clinical trials of nexavar  including a pivotal trial in lung cancer announced in the first quarter of however  the presentation of our statement of operations will change in future periods as we reflect nexavar s commercial status and present our share of the profits or losses from nexavar 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a net increase of million  or percent  from the increase primarily relates to increased selling and marketing costs of million due to employee related costs for hiring our sales and marketing personnel as we establish our commercial infrastructure as well as third party costs incurred by onyx and bayer to support our product launch of nexavar in the us additionally  general and administrative costs increased million primarily due to employee related costs as a result of headcount increases to support our planned commercialization of nexavar 
nexavar  being developed with our collaborator bayer  was approved by the fda on december  for the treatment of individuals with advanced kidney cancer 
this is the only product for which we have received marketing approval 
sales of nexavar were nominal in  and our share of the product sales were offset against our selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  or percent  from the increase primarily related to increased selling and marketing costs of million related to increased headcount and third party costs for precommercial marketing activities for nexavar   related to consulting expenses for information systems  increased overhead and occupancy costs of  and  of external costs incurred to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly in as onyx and bayer support us sales and marketing efforts as well as invest in pre launch preparations in europe and other territories worldwide 
however  the presentation of our statement of operations will change in future periods as we reflect nexavar s commercial status and present our share of the profits or losses from nexavar 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  consulting  other third party costs  corporate functional expenses and allocations for overhead and occupancy costs 
not all selling costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our selling expenses  approximately percent in  percent in and percent in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the selling costs incurred by bayer 
such amounts are recorded based on invoices and other information we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
in addition  selling costs incurred by us and reimbursed by bayer are recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring 
prior to june  in addition to our small molecule program  we were developing therapeutic viruses that selectively replicate in cells with cancer causing genetic mutations 
in june  we announced that we were discontinuing this program as part of a business realignment that placed an increased priority on the development of nexavar 
during  we recorded aggregate charges of million associated with the restructuring 
these charges consist of million related to employee severance benefits and million related to the early termination of a process development and manufacturing agreement with xoma us llc 
in addition  we incurred aggregate charges of million related to the discontinued use of a portion of our leased facilities and the disposal of certain property and equipment 
we reclassified  from property and equipment to other current assets for equipment held for sale at december  had this equipment not been reclassified to other current assets  we would have recorded an additional  of depreciation expense in in  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of  due to a change in estimate related to the discontinued use and inability to sublet a portion of our leased facility in richmond  california 
as of december   all restructuring costs have been fully paid 
interest income  net 
we had net interest income of million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to higher interest rates in as compared to in addition  our average cash balances in benefited from our november sale of equity securities from which we received approximately million in net cash proceeds 
we had net interest income of million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to the cash received from our february sale of equity securities 
interest expense was immaterial for the periods presented 
other expense related party 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx  inc assets from our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays  compound libraries and certain intellectual property rights in exchange for preferred stock valued at  the entire amount was recorded as other income related party on the date of sale 
the value of the preferred stock was initially determined based on similar sales of syrrx preferred stock to unrelated third parties for cash 
in  due to a further round of financing completed by syrrx  we recorded  as other expense related party to recognize a permanent impairment in the carrying value of the investment 
in  based on a further round of financing completed by syrrx in april  we recorded an additional impairment charge of  as other expense related party to reduce the carrying value of the investment 
we considered the reduction in value of the syrrx investment to be other than temporary 
we did not record any write downs in and at the time of the transactions mentioned above  a member of the board of directors of onyx was a director and officer of syrrx 
this board member is no longer an officer of syrrx 
other income 
in april  we redeemed our investment in syrrx  inc as a result of the acquisition of syrrx by takeda pharmaceutical company limited 
we received cash of  as a result of the redemption  which resulted in a gain of  this amount was recorded as other income 
no similar items were recorded in fiscal years and income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented and since inception 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million and for state income tax purposes were approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
related party transactions we had a loan with a former employee of which approximately  was outstanding at december  this loan bore interest at per annum  however  we had forgiven  of interest over the term of the loan through august this loan was repaid in august in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities in of million was attributable to our public offering completed in november  which raised aggregate net cash proceeds of million  as well as million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants and  received from the redemption of our investment in syrxx 
in addition  we received a million creditable milestone based payment from bayer in august as a result of the nda filing for nexavar 
this payment  in addition to million of milestones received in previous years  and million received from bayer in january in connection with the approval of nexavar by the fda  will be repayable to bayer from a portion of any of onyx s future profits and royalties 
if onyx does not receive any profits or royalties on any products  onyx will not have to repay bayer any creditable milestone based payments 
these sources of cash were partially offset by net cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million in was attributable to our public offering completed in february  which raised aggregate net cash proceeds of million  million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and  received from the sale of fixed assets of laboratory equipment associated with our restructuring in these sources of cash were partially offset by cash used in operations of million and capital expenditures of million primarily related to the move of our office facility from richmond to emeryville 
our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in in  the cash was used primarily for co funding clinical development programs for nexavar  establishing sales and marketing infrastructure at onyx and bayer to prepare for the commercial launch of nexavar in the us  and for third party pre commercial marketing activities 
in  the cash was used primarily for co funding the clinical development program with bayer for nexavar 
in  the cash was used primarily for co funding clinical development costs with bayer for nexavar and to fund development expenses including manufacturing and clinical trial costs for onyx expenditures for capital equipment amounted to  in  million in  and  in capital expenditures in were primarily for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
capital expenditures in were primarily for upgrades to our information technology equipment and leasehold improvements and furniture related to our move in december into our new corporate headquarters 
we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of up to  in primarily for information technology software and equipment 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including the approximately million in net proceeds from our public offering closed in november and interest thereon  will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations into however  this is dependent upon the revenue potential of nexavar in the united states  pending regulatory approvals and revenue potential for nexavar in europe and other territories throughout the world as well as the ongoing clinical trial program 
if we change our commercialization or development plans  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
in addition  we are conducting multiple clinical trials of nexavar in other tumor types  including pivotal studies in liver cancer and metastatic melanoma  and in february  we and bayer began a phase iii trial of nexavar in combination with other anticancer agents in non small cell lung cancer 
while we received approval for nexavar for treatment of individuals with advanced kidney cancer in the us  the revenue potential in the first year of an evolving market is not determinable 
it is also our intention to invest significantly in nexavar in order to assess its possible use in the treatment of other cancers 
we also maintain an active business development program to identify additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire or license  which would also increase our future development expenses 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the co funding of the programs in future periods beyond we intend to seek this additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases  net of sublease income this table does not include any payments under research and development collaborations  as the amount and timing of such payments are not known 
this table also does not include the obligation to repay the million creditable milestone based payments that we received from bayer as of december  or the additional million we received in january  because the repayment of these amounts is contingent upon onyx generating profits or royalties on any products 
whether onyx will ever generate any profits or royalties is not known at this time 
in  we entered into a new operating lease for  square feet of office space in emeryville  california  which now serves as our corporate headquarters 
the lease expires on february  when we moved into this new facility in december  we vacated our  square foot facility in richmond  california 
the lease for this facility expired in april  and we did not renew this lease 
we also have a lease for  square feet of space in a secondary facility in richmond  california 
in december  we determined that we no longer required the secondary facility because of a reduction in force 
in september  the company entered into a sublease agreement for this space through september recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  share based payment  fas r  a revision to fas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  effective for reporting periods beginning after june  fas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas however  fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company is required to adopt the new standard no later than january  fas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under fas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will adopt fas r using the modified prospective basis on january  our adoption of fas r will have a material impact on our statement of operations and our net loss per share 
we expect to continue to use the black scholes model for valuing our stock based compensation 
however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in may  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas no 

fas no 
is a replacement of apb no 
 accounting changes and fas no 
 reporting of accounting changes in interim financial statements 
fas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
fas no 
provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
fas no 
also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
fas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will be adopting this pronouncement beginning in our fiscal year and do not currently believe that it will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the accumulated paid in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of fas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating this transition method 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at december   we had no unrealized investment losses that we have deemed to be other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
by policy  we minimize risk by placing our investments with high quality debt security issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and investment grade government and non government debt securities 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december average average fair value interest fair value interest maturity in millions rate maturity in millions rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate months months we did not hold any derivative instruments as of december   and we have not held derivative instruments in the past 
however  our investment policy does allow us to use derivative financial instruments for the purposes of hedging foreign currency denominated obligations 
our cash flows are denominated in us dollars
