prolonged disruption of production at any of our mines would result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability  which could be material 
decreases in our profitability as a result of the factors described above could materially adversely impact our quarterly or annual results 
these risks may not be covered by our insurance policies 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks that are beyond our control  and these risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies 
our mines are subject to conditions or events beyond our control that could disrupt operations and affect the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time 
these risks include fires and explosions from methane  natural disasters  such as heavy rains and flooding  mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems  mine flooding due to the failure of subsurface water seals or water removal equipment  changes or variations in geologic conditions  such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposits  inability to acquire mining rights or permits  employee injuries or fatalities  and labor related interruptions 
during the past two years  three loss incidents have occurred at our mining complexes 
on june   our pattiki mining complex was temporarily idled for a period of calendar days by the failure of the vertical conveyor belt system used in conveying raw coal out of the mine

for details on how these incidents adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations analysis of historical results of operations 
loss incidents such as these are likely to increase the cost of mining and delay or halt production at particular mines for varying lengths of time 
we do carry commercial including business interruption and extra expense property insurance policies  however  these risks may not be fully covered by these insurance policies 
a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs and could adversely affect our profitability 
efficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers  preferably with at least one year of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks 
in recent years  a shortage of trained coal miners has caused 
table of contents us to operate certain mining units without full staff  which decreases our productivity and increases our costs 
this shortage of trained coal miners is the result of a significant percentage of experienced coal miners reaching the age for retirement  combined with the difficulty of attracting new workers to the coal industry 
thus  this shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period 
if the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens  it could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our coal  which could adversely affect our profitability 
although none of our employees are members of unions  our work force may not remain union free in the future 
none of our employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
however  all of our work force may not remain union free in the future 
if some or all of our currently union free operations were to become unionized  it could adversely affect our productivity and increase the risk of work stoppages at our mining complexes 
in addition  even if we remain union free  our operations may still be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies  particularly if union workers were to orchestrate boycotts against our operations 
we may be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations  which could reduce our production  cash flow and profitability 
mining companies must obtain numerous permits that impose strict conditions and obligations relating to various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining 
the permitting rules are complex and can change over time 
the public has the right to comment on permit applications and otherwise participate in the permitting process  including through court intervention 
accordingly  permits required by us to conduct our operations may not be issued  maintained or renewed  or may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to economically conduct our mining operations 
limitations on our ability to conduct our mining operations due to the inability to obtain or renew necessary permits could reduce our production  cash flow and profitability 
please read regulations and laws mining permits and approvals 
recent federal district court decisions in west virginia  and related litigation filed in federal district court in kentucky  have created uncertainty regarding the future ability to obtain certain general permits authorizing the construction of valley fills for the disposal of overburden from mining operations 
a july decision by the southern district of west virginia in ohio valley environmental coalition v 
bulen enjoined the huntington district of the us army corps of engineers from issuing further permits pursuant to nationwide permit  which is a general permit issued by the us army corps of engineers to streamline the process for obtaining permits under section of the clean water act 
the fourth circuit court of appeals issued a decision on november   vacating the district court decision in bulen and remanding the case to the lower court for further argument 
a similar lawsuit has been filed in federal district court in kentucky that seeks to enjoin the issuance of permits pursuant to nationwide permit by the louisville district of the us army corps of engineers 
we do not operate any mines located within the southern district of west virginia  and currently only utilize nationwide permit at one location in indiana 
in the event current or future litigation contesting the use of nationwide permit is successful  we may be required to apply for individual discharge permits pursuant to section of the clean water act in areas where it would have otherwise utilized nationwide permit such a change could result in delays in obtaining required mining permits to conduct operations  which could in turn result in reduced production  cash flow and profitability 
fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce revenues by causing us to reduce our production or by impairing our ability to supply coal to our customers 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers and  as a result  the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make our coal production less competitive than coal produced from other sources 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country 
for instance  difficulty in coordinating the many eastern coal loading facilities  the large number of small shipments  the steeper average grades of the terrain and a more unionized workforce are all issues that combine to make coal shipments originating in the eastern united states inherently more expensive on a per mile basis than coal shipments originating in the western united states 
historically  high coal transportation rates from the western coal producing areas into certain eastern markets limited the use of western coal in those markets 
lower or higher rail rates from the western coal producing areas to markets served by eastern us coal producers have created 
table of contents major competitive challenges  as well as opportunities for eastern coal producers 
in the event of lower transportation costs  the increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our mines depend on a single transportation carrier or a single mode of transportation 
disruption of any of these transportation services due to weather related problems  flooding  drought  accidents  mechanical difficulties  strikes  lockouts  bottlenecks  and other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers 
our transportation providers may face difficulties in the future that may impair our ability to supply coal to our customers  resulting in decreased revenues 
if there are disruptions of the transportation services provided by our primary rail or barge carriers that transport our coal and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers to ship our coal  our business could be adversely affected 
the states of kentucky and west virginia have recently increased enforcement of weight limits on coal trucks on their public roads 
it is possible that other states in which our coal is transported by truck will modify their laws to limit truck weight limits 
such legislation could result in shipment delays and increased costs 
an increase in transportation costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase or to maintain production and could adversely affect revenues 
expansions of existing mines that we have completed since our formation  as well as mine expansions that we may undertake in the future  involve a number of risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits 
since our formation and the acquisition of our predecessor in august  we have expanded our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in existing  adjacent and neighboring properties 
we continually seek to expand our operations and coal reserves 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties we are able to acquire through such expansion  our profitability may decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
expansion transactions involve various inherent risks  including uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental or mine safety liabilities of  expansion opportunities  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an expansion  problems that could arise from the integration of the new operations  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the expansion opportunity 
any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from an expansion 
any expansion opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
in addition  future expansions could result in us assuming more long term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets than we have assumed in our previous expansions 
we may not be able to successfully grow through future acquisitions  and we may not be able to effectively integrate the various businesses or properties we acquire 
historically  a portion of our growth and operating results have been from acquisitions 
our future growth could be limited if we are unable to continue to make acquisitions  or if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties we acquire 
we may not be successful in consummating any acquisitions and the consequences of these acquisitions is unknown 
moreover  any acquisition could be dilutive to earnings and distributions to unitholders and any additional debt incurred to finance an acquisition could affect our ability to make distributions to unitholders 
our ability to make acquisitions in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements  competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates 

table of contents the unavailability of an adequate supply of coal reserves that can be mined at competitive costs could cause our profitability to decline 
our profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine coal reserves that have the geological characteristics that enable them to be mined at competitive costs and to meet the quality needed by our customers 
because our reserves decline as we mine coal  our future success and growth depend  in part  upon our ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable 
replacement reserves may not be available when required or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines 
we may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of any reserves that we acquire  which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
exhaustion of reserves at particular mines also may have an adverse effect on our operating results that is disproportionate to the percentage of overall production represented by such mines 
our ability to obtain other reserves in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements  competition from other coal companies for attractive properties  the lack of suitable acquisition candidates or the inability to acquire coal properties on commercially reasonable terms 
our business depends  in part  upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional coal reserves that we can recover economically 
our existing reserves will decline as they are depleted 
our planned development projects and acquisition activities may not increase our reserves significantly and we may not have continued success expanding existing and developing additional mines 
we believe that there are substantial reserves on certain adjacent or neighboring properties that are unleased and otherwise available 
however  we may not be able to negotiate leases with the landowners on acceptable terms 
an inability to expand our operations into adjacent or neighboring reserves under this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates of our coal reserves may prove inaccurate  and you should not place undue reliance on these estimates 
the estimates of our coal reserves may vary substantially from actual amounts of coal we are able to economically recover 
the reserve data set forth in item properties represent our engineering estimates 
all of the reserves presented in this annual report on form k constitute proven and probable reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions  any one of which may vary considerably from actual results 
these factors and assumptions relate to geological and mining conditions  which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and or differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine  the percentage of coal in the ground ultimately recoverable  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future coal prices  operating costs  capital expenditures  severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs 
for these reasons  estimates of the recoverable quantities of coal attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variations may be material 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on the coal reserve data included herein 
mining in certain areas in which we operate is more difficult and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the united states  which could affect the mining operations and cost structures of these areas 
the geological characteristics of some of our coal reserves  such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness  make them difficult and costly to mine 
as mines become depleted  replacement reserves may not be available when required or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristic of the depleting mines 
in addition  permitting  licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements associated with certain of our mining operations are more costly and time consuming to satisfy 
these factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of  and our customers ability to use coal produced by  our mines 

table of contents unexpected increases in raw material costs could significantly impair our operating profitability 
our coal mining operations use significant amounts of steel  petroleum products and other raw materials in various pieces of mining equipment  supplies and materials  including the roof bolts required by the room and pillar method of mining 
steel prices have risen significantly in recent years  and historically  the prices of scrap steel  natural gas and coking coal consumed in the production of iron and steel have fluctuated 
recently we have experienced cost increases for various commodities and services influenced by the recent steep increases in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
costs of diesel fuel  explosives  and coal trucking have all escalated as a direct result of supply chain problems related to the effect of recent hurricanes along the us gulf coast 
there may be other acts of nature or terrorist attacks or threats that could also increase the costs of raw materials 
if the price of steel  petroleum products or other raw materials increase  our operational expenses will increase  which could have a significant negative impact on our profitability 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance 
in addition  our managing general partner s discretion in establishing financial reserves may negatively impact our receipt of cash distributions 
because distributions on our common units are dependent on the amount of cash generated through our coal sales  distributions may fluctuate based on the amount of coal we are able to produce and the price at which we are able to sell it 
therefore  the current quarterly distribution or any distribution may not be paid each quarter 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend upon numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of our managing general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits 
the partnership agreement gives our managing general partner broad discretion in establishing financial reserves for the proper conduct of our business 
these reserves also will affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
in addition  the partnership agreement requires the managing general partner to deduct from operating surplus each year estimated maintenance capital expenditures as opposed to actual expenditures in order to reduce wide disparities in operating surplus caused by fluctuating maintenance capital expenditure levels 
if estimated maintenance capital expenditures in a year are higher than actual maintenance capital expenditures  then the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders will be lower than if actual maintenance capital expenditures were deducted from operating surplus 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders or capitalize on business opportunities 
we have long term indebtedness  consisting of our outstanding senior unsecured notes 
at december   our total indebtedness outstanding was million 
our leverage may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and capital needs  limit our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business opportunities  make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic or operating conditions  and make it more difficult to self insure for our workers compensation obligations 
in addition  we have unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
future borrowings  under our credit facilities or otherwise  could result in a significant increase in our leverage 
our payments of principal and interest on any indebtedness will reduce the cash available for distribution on our units 
we will be prohibited from making cash distributions during an event of default under any of our indebtedness  or 
table of contents if either before or after such distribution  it fails to meet a coverage test based on the ratio of our consolidated debt to our consolidated cash flow 
various limitations in our debt agreements may reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to engage in some transactions and to capitalize on business opportunities 
any subsequent refinancing of our current indebtedness or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations related to the statutory requirement that we return mined property to its approximate original condition and workers compensation and black lung benefits 
our inability to acquire or failure to maintain surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us 
federal and state laws require us to place and maintain bonds to secure our obligations to repair and return property to its approximate original state after it has been mined often referred to as reclaim or reclamation  to pay federal and state workers compensation and pneumoconiosis  or black lung  benefits and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds provide assurance that we will perform our statutorily required obligations and are referred to as surety bonds 
these bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis 
the failure to maintain or the inability to acquire sufficient surety bonds  as required by state and federal laws  could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the loss of our mining permits 
such failure could result from a variety of factors  including lack of availability  higher expense or unreasonable terms of new surety bonds  the ability of current and future surety bond issuers to increase required collateral  or limitations on availability of collateral for surety bond issuers due to the terms of our credit agreements  and the exercise by third party surety bond holders of their right to refuse to renew the surety 
we have outstanding surety bonds with third parties for reclamation expenses and for federal and state workers compensation obligations and other miscellaneous obligations 
we may have difficulty maintaining our surety bonds for mine reclamation as well as workers compensation and black lung benefits 
our inability to acquire or failure to maintain these bonds would have a material adverse effect on us 
our mining operations are subject to extensive and costly laws and regulations  and such current and future laws and regulations could increase current operating costs or limit our ability to produce coal 
we are subject to numerous and detailed federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting the coal mining industry  including laws and regulations pertaining to employee health and safety  permitting and licensing requirements  air quality standards  water pollution  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  the discharge of materials into the environment  surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations 
we are required to prepare and present to federal  state and local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment 
the costs  liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
the possibility exists that new laws or regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially affect our mining operations  cash flow  and profitability  either through direct impacts such as new requirements impacting our existing mining operations  or indirect impacts such as new laws and regulations that discourage or limit our customers use of coal 
please read regulation and laws 
recent mining accidents involving fatalities in west virginia and kentucky have received national attention and prompted responses at the state and national level that have resulted in increased scrutiny of current industry safety practices and procedures at all mining operations 
on january   west virginia governor joe manchin signed into law a bill imposing stringent new mine safety and accident reporting requirements and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of mine safety laws 
other states  including illinois  have proposed or passed similar bills and resolutions addressing mine safety practices 
in addition  several mine safety bills have been introduced in congress that would mandate similar improvements in mine safety practices  increase or add civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with such laws or regulations  and expand the scope of federal oversight  inspection  and enforcement activities 
on february   the federal msha announced the promulgation of new emergency rules on mine safety 

table of contents these rules address mine safety equipment  training  and emergency reporting requirements 
unlike most msha rules  these emergency rules will become effective immediately upon their publication in the federal register 
implementing and complying with these new laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position 
some of our operating subsidiaries lease a portion of the surface properties upon which their mining facilities are located 
our operating subsidiaries do not  in all instances  own all of the surface properties upon which their mining facilities have been constructed 
certain of the operating companies have constructed and now operate all or some portion of their facilities on properties owned by unrelated third parties with whom the applicable company has entered into a long term lease 
we have no reason to believe that there exists any risk of loss of these leasehold rights given the terms and provisions of the subject leases and the nature and identity of the third party lessors  however  in the unlikely event of any loss of these leasehold rights  operations could be disrupted or otherwise adversely impacted as a result of increased costs associated with retaining the necessary land use 
tax risks to our common unitholders if we were to become subject to entity level taxation for federal or state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the internal revenue service irs on this matter 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of 
distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses  deductions or credits would flow through to you 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
thus  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in our anticipated cash flow and after tax return to you  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
current law may change  causing us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to entity level taxation 
for example  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us or as an entity  the cash available for distribution to you would be reduced 
a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely impact the market for our common units  and the costs of any contest will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions that we take  even positions taken with the advice of counsel 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the prices at which they trade 
moreover  the costs of any contest between us and the irs will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders 
even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us  you will be required to pay taxes on your share of our taxable income 
you will be required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income  whether or not you receive cash distributions from us 
you may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from your share of our taxable income 

table of contents tax gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be different than expected 
if you sell your units  you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those units 
prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income you were allocated for a unit  which decreased your tax basis in that unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to you if the unit is sold at a price greater than your tax basis in that unit  even if the price you receive is less than your original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income to you 
tax exempt entities and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts known as iras and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax  including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file united states federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
we will treat each purchaser of our units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of our units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of units  we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from your sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns 
you will likely be subject to state and local taxes and income tax return filing requirements as a result of investing in our units 
in addition to federal income taxes  you will likely be subject to other taxes  such as state and local income taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property 
you will likely be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  you may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we may own property or conduct business in other states in the future 
it is your responsibility to file all federal  state and local tax returns 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state and local tax consequences of an investment in our units 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests within a month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a month period 
a termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income for the year in which the termination occurs 
thus  if this occurs you will be allocated an increased amount of federal taxable income for the year in which we are considered to be terminated as a percentage of the cash distributed to you with respect to that period 
although the amount of increase cannot be estimated because it depends upon numerous factors including the timing of the termination  the amount could be material 
our termination  currently would not affect our classification  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred

table of contents item properties coal reserves we must obtain permits from applicable state regulatory authorities before beginning to mine particular reserves 
applications for permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation  and must address a variety of environmental  health  and safety matters associated with a proposed mining operation 
these matters include the manner and sequencing of coal extraction  the storage  use and disposal of waste and other substances and other impacts on the environment  the construction of water containment areas  and reclamation of the area after coal extraction 
we are required to post bonds to secure performance under our permits 
as is typical in the coal industry  we strive to obtain mining permits within a time frame that allows us to mine reserves as planned on an uninterrupted basis 
we begin preparing applications for permits for areas that we intend to mine sufficiently in advance of our planned mining activities to allow adequate time to complete the permitting process 
regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance  and the public has rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including intervention in the courts 
for the reserves set forth in the table below  we are not currently aware of matters which would significantly hinder our ability to obtain future mining permits on a timely basis 
our reported coal reserves are those we believe can be economically and legally extracted and produced at the time of the filing of this annual report on form k and are in accordance with guidance from sec industry guide no 
in determining whether our reserves meet this economical and legal standard  we take into account  among other things  our potential ability or inability to obtain a mining permit  the possible necessity of revising a mining plan  changes in estimated future costs  changes in future cash flows caused by changes in mining permits  variations in quantity and quality of coal  and varying levels of demand and their effects on selling prices 
at december   we had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland  pennsylvania  and west virginia 
all of the estimates of reserves which are presented in this annual report on form k are of proven and probable reserves as defined below 
for information on location of our mines  please read mining operations under item business

table of contents our reserve estimates are prepared from geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff of geologists and engineers 
this data is obtained through our extensive  ongoing exploration drilling and in mine channel sampling programs 
our drill spacing criteria adhere to standards as defined by the us geological survey 
the maximum acceptable distance from seam data points varies with the geologic nature of the coal seam being studied  but generally the standard for a proven reserves is that points of observation are no greater than mile apart and are projected to extend as a mile wide belt around each point of measurement and b probable reserves is that points of observation are between and miles apart and are projected to extend as a mile wide belt that lies mile from the points of measurement 
reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect evolving market conditions  mining activities  additional analyses  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestment of reserve holdings  modification of mining plans or mining methods  and other factors 
reserves represent that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced  and reflect estimated losses involved in producing a saleable product 
all of our reserves are steam coal 
the million tons of reserves listed as pounds of so per mmbtu are compliance coal which means coal that meets sulfur emission standards imposed by phase i and ii of the caa 
assigned reserves are those reserves that have been designated for mining by a specific operation 
unassigned reserves are those reserves that have not yet been designated for mining by a specific operation 
btu values are reported on an as shipped  fully washed basis 
shipments that are either fully or partially raw will have a lower btu value 
we control certain leases for coal deposits that are near  but not contiguous to  our primary reserve bases 
the tons controlled by these leases are classified as non reserve coal deposits and are not included in our reported reserves 
as of december   these non reserve coal deposits are as follows dotiki million tons  pattiki million tons  hopkins county million tons  gibson north million tons  gibson south million tons  and warrior million tons 
we lease almost all of our reserves and generally have the right to maintain leases in force until the exhaustion of mineable and merchantable coal located within the leased premises or a larger coal reserve area 
these leases provide for royalties to be paid to the lessor at a fixed amount per ton or as a percentage of the sales price 
many leases require payment of minimum royalties  payable either at the time of the execution of the lease or in periodic installments  even if no mining activities have begun 
these minimum royalties are normally credited against the production royalties owed to a lessor once coal production has commenced
