item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of future results 
overview since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of blood safety systems and  more recently  immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease 
with the exception of a non recurring gain recognized in  we have been generally unprofitable since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
except for the platelet system  for which the european union approved issuance of a ce mark  all of our product candidates are in the research and development stage 
in late  we filed an ind for crs  a product candidate employing our attenuated listeria technology platform  and we have elected to re enter phase i human clinical trials in the united states for the red blood cell system  which we plan to initiate in our primary source of revenue is from milestone and development funding from our collaborative partners and we have not received significant revenue to date from product sales 
we must conduct significant research  development  preclinical and clinical evaluation  commercialization and regulatory compliance activities on our product candidates that  together with anticipated general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial losses at least until after commercialization of additional products 
our ability to achieve a profitable level of operations in the future will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our immunotherapy and blood safety product candidates 
we may never achieve a profitable level of operations 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from an ongoing development agreement with medimmune and commercialization agreements with bioone 
under the agreements with medimmune and bioone  we are receiving development funding and may receive contingent milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
as of december   we have received million of upfront and milestone payments from medimmune under the terms of the agreement  consisting of a million up front payment and a million milestone payment  and have received a total of million in cash payments and equity securities from bioone 
we are also receiving development funding from medimmune and recognized million and million of development funding during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also entered into cooperative agreements with the armed forces of the united states to conduct certain research and development activities  and we recognized million under funding awards received in connection with these agreements during the year ending december  of the million recognized under the armed forces agreements during the year ending december   million related to our blood safety programs and million related to our immunotherapy programs 
we recently discontinued a collaboration with the pharmaceutical division of kirin brewery co 
ltd 
under which we were developing and marketing products for stem cell transplantation 
we recognized approximately million in deferred revenue in the period ending december   that would have been recognized in future periods had the collaboration continued 
effective february   we entered into a new agreement with baxter related to the intercept blood system 
under terms of the agreement  we gained worldwide rights to the intercept platelet and plasma systems previously held by baxter  excluding certain asian countries covered in agreements with bioone 
we previously acquired worldwide commercialization rights for the red blood cell system from baxter 
we will pay baxter royalties on future product sales  with a rate of of net sales for the platelet system  for the plasma system and for the red blood cell system 
the payment of royalties replaces the terms of previous agreements in which we received a defined share of gross profit from product sales 
under the terms of the february agreement  baxter has agreed to supply certain transition services to us in at our expense  including 
table of contents regulatory  technical and back office support  and to conduct certain continued development efforts relating to the plasma system at its expense 
for the year ended december   we applied million of baxter s million commitment to expenses we incurred during the period in preparing an application for ce mark approval of the plasma system  which was recognized as development funding revenue 
we will record gains and deferred gains of approximately million in the period ending march   resulting largely from the disbursement to us of funds that remain from the million commitment described above 
in february  we also repaid the million promissory note plus accrued interest owed to baxter capital that had originally been due in december under the terms of february agreement  we are responsible for the commercialization and development of the platelet and plasma systems  except in parts of asia  and we expect that our spending over the next year in support of research  development and commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems will be in excess of the contribution from product sales to customers and from milestone payments and development funding for such programs from baxter  bioone  the armed forces of the united states  or armed forces  and others 
we also anticipate increasing our expenditures in support of clinical trials and device development of our red blood cell system  as well as the preclinical and early stage clinical development of our immunotherapy programs in both cancer and infectious disease 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to collaborative arrangements  contract research and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  preclinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue and research and development expenses revenue related to the cost reimbursement provisions under development contracts is recognized as the costs on the project are incurred 
revenue related to at risk milestones specified under development contracts is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
to date we have not received license fees or milestone payments that are refundable 
to the extent that they are subject to future performance criteria  we recognize as revenue ratably over the estimated license or development period 
we have received up front payments from collaboration agreements 
these up front payments are deferred and recognized over the period to which the payments relate 
we receive certain united states government grants that support our research effort in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
revenue associated with these grants is recognized as costs under each grant are incurred 
short term investments we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents consist principally of short term money market instruments and commercial paper 
we have classified all debt securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 

table of contents accrued liabilities we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  preclinical safety studies  external laboratory studies and development activities performed by baxter  for research and development services performed 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
results of operations compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding  which includes amounts received from baxter  bioone  medimmune and kirin  increased to million from million for the increase was primarily due to revenue recognized from up front payments received from bioone and medimmune that were deferred in and are being recognized ratably over respective development terms  increased development funding and a milestone payment received from medimmune under the april agreement 
milestone and development funding from baxter  bioone  medimmune and kirin was   and  of milestone and development revenue respectively for the year ended december  revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million in the year ended december   from million for  due primarily to increased government funding for both blood safety and vaccines programs 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of product sales revenue from our share of sales of the platelet system in europe 
as a result of a loan dispute with baxter capital that was subsequently resolved  we also recognized approximately million in product sales revenue from that was deferred until february the platelet system is currently undergoing experience studies  regulatory review and reimbursement review in many european countries 
we do not expect sales of the platelet system in europe to significantly change until at least the platelet system is approved for sale and reimbursement levels are established in the larger market european countries 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for scientific personnel  payments to consultants  payments for licensed technologies  supplies and chemicals used in in house laboratories  costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of equipment and external contract research expenses  including clinical trials  preclinical safety studies  manufacturing development and other laboratory studies 
research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended december   from million for increased spending on vaccines programs  particularly in support of development of crs and crs  was offset by reduced spending for our blood safety programs 
our total research and development costs included million for our blood safety programs and million for our immunotherapy programs for the year ended december   and million for our blood safety programs and million for our immunotherapy programs for the comparable period in we anticipate that our research and development expenses for will increase relative to  primarily as a result of our entering phase i clinical trials with crs and the red blood cell system  as well as conducting more extensive preclinical studies for crs due to the inherent uncertainties and risks associated with developing biomedical and biopharmaceutical products  including but not limited to intense and changing government regulation  uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainty associated with manufacturing  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the costs to complete these research and development projects 
we face numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the successful completion of our research and development projects 
see risk factors above 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for  due principally to reduced headcount costs 
table of contents in which result from the restructuring of our operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses will rise modestly for our domestic operations in  primarily reflecting increased headcount in functions supporting both our blood safety and vaccines programs 
we expect to incur modest incremental selling  general and administrative costs in europe as a result of the february restructured agreements with baxter 
restructuring 
on june   we announced that we realigned our operations to better match our cost structure to our operations 
as a result of the realignment  we reduced our workforce by approximately and reduced our operating expenses 
we recorded aggregate charges of million during the second and third quarters of related to this restructuring 
restructuring costs primarily include severance benefits to employees terminated as part of the restructuring 
we do not expect to record further costs related to the restructuring 
gain on loan settlement 
concurrent with the restructured agreements between baxter and us  baxter capital and we entered into an agreement under which we immediately paid million to baxter capital and entered into a promissory note for million  payable with interest in december baxter capital agreed to accept these payments in full satisfaction of the loan obligation  and the parties dismissed all related legal actions 
as a result  we recorded a non operating gain of million that reflected the difference between loan principal and accrued interest balances recorded through  less amounts paid in february and remaining accrued liabilities as a result of the settlement  and long term debt of million  representing the note due to baxter capital in december  which accrues interest at 
the gain on the loan settlement was recognized in the period ending march   when the settlement occurred 
as a result of the february agreement with baxter  we will record gains and deferred gains of approximately million in the period ending march   resulting largely from the disbursement of escrow funds that remain from the million commitment from baxter associated with the restructured agreements 
also as a result of the agreement  we repaid the million promissory note plus accrued interest owed to baxter capital that was originally due in december net interest and other income expense 
net interest and other income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest and other expense of million for net interest and other income for the year ended december  includes the million gain realized under the baxter restructured agreement as discussed in the preceding paragraph 
the change in net activity of million is primarily the result of the repayment of million to baxter under the terms of a loan dispute settlement with baxter in february  offset by slightly lower interest income 
net interest income was million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the reduced interest income in compared to was due to lower investment account balances 
we expect to earn interest income at market rates in proportion to the marketable securities balances we maintain 
in  interest was accrued at on the million note payable to baxter capital 
in  interest was accrued at on the million loan from baxter capital 
compared with revenue 
for the year ended december   milestone and development funding from baxter increased to million from million for the increase was primarily due to the termination of the phase iii clinical trials for the red blood cell system in september  for which baxter was incurring greater expenses than us 
development funding is in the form of balancing payments made by baxter to us  if necessary  to reimburse us for development spending in excess of the levels determined by baxter and us 
development funding from baxter was of total revenue for development funding from other sources  which included medimmune  bioone  kirin and the nmdp  increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to development 
table of contents funding from medimmune and from up front payments received from medimmune and bioone that were deferred and are being recognized ratably over the respective development periods 
revenue recognized from kirin in and was from the up front payment that was deferred and recognized ratably over the development period 
there is no development activity co funded by kirin currently ongoing or planned at cerus 
the agreement with the nmdp expired on march  development funding from medimmune  bioone  kirin and the nmdp was   and less than  respectively  of total revenue for revenue from government grants and cooperative agreements increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to increased program expenditures under the cooperative agreements with the armed forces  largely in support of research and development applicable to the intercept blood system for plasma 
during  we also recognized million of revenue from eight separate research grants from the national institutes of health  including amounts recognized under a million grant to develop an anthrax vaccine 
we may not receive additional government grants in the future 
we recognized million of product sales revenue in from sales of the intercept blood system for platelets in europe 
as a result of the loan dispute with baxter capital  recognition of product sales revenue in was deferred and recognized in the first quarter of  when payment of such revenue was collected from baxter 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to reduced development spending by baxter  the termination of phase iii clinical trials in the red blood cell program in september and our june restructuring 
our total research and development costs for included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs  including vaccine programs  while research and development costs in included million for the intercept blood system program and million for all other programs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to fewer administrative personnel and consultants in as a result of our june restructuring 
restructuring 
on june   we announced that we realigned our operations to better match our cost structure to our operations 
as a result of the realignment  we reduced our workforce by approximately and reduced our operating expenses 
we recorded aggregate charges of million during the second and third quarters of related to this restructuring 
restructuring costs primarily include severance benefits to employees terminated as part of the restructuring 
net interest and other income expense 
net interest and other income expense was million of net expense for  down slightly from million of net expense in in and  we accrued interest expense at on the million loan from baxter capital 
interest expense accrues at on a million note payable to baxter capital 
interest income from investments was million for compared to million for the change was primarily due to more favorable yields on investments as a result of increases in market interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of capital to date have primarily consisted of public offerings  private placements of equity securities  loans from baxter capital  payments received under our agreements with baxter  bioone  medimmune and others  united states government grants and cooperative agreements and interest income 
to date  we have not received significant revenue from product sales and we will not derive significant revenue from 
table of contents product sales unless and until one or more additional products receive regulatory approval and achieve market acceptance 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in cash used in our operating activities during was impacted by the increase in our deferred revenues mainly due to agreements with bioone and changes in other operating assets and liabilities  offset by net income of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million resulted primarily from sales and maturities of short term investments exceeding the purchases of short term investments and capital improvement made during the year 
working capital increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the settlement of the loan dispute with baxter capital in in february  we entered into an agreement with baxter capital under which we paid million to baxter capital and entered into a promissory note for million  payable with interest in december baxter capital agreed to accept these payments in full satisfaction of the million loan and accrued interest under the previous loan obligation  and the parties agreed to dismiss all related legal actions 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements with baxter  we agreed to immediately repay the million promissory note and accrued interest to baxter capital upon receipt of a disbursement from baxter representing remaining funds held in escrow from baxter s million allotment for commercialization of the platelet and plasma systems in europe  less certain specified amounts 
we believe that our available cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from existing development and grant arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through at least mid these near term capital requirements are dependent on various factors  including the development progress and costs of the intercept blood system and our therapeutic vaccine programs  payments from our development and commercialization partners  including medimmune and bioone  and from the united states government  and costs related to creating  maintaining and defending our intellectual property 
our long term capital requirements will be dependent on these factors and on the outcome of ongoing securities class action and derivative lawsuits against us  our ability to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financings or through additional collaborative arrangements or government grants  development progress in our vaccine programs  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of the intercept blood system and other product candidates  competitive developments and regulatory factors 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to our investors  and may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
in august  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock and or debt securities 
in june  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock with gross proceeds of million under the shelf registration statement 
we may raise additional capital by selling securities at any time  though we have no current commitments to offer or sell additional securities pursuant to this registration statement
