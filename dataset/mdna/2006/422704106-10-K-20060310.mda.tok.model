item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
many of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control  including the volatility of metals prices  interest rates  global or regional political or economic policies  inflation  developments and crises  governmental regulations  continuity of orebodies  and speculation and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors 
we cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience net losses in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors including expectations for inflation  speculative activities  relative exchange rates of the us dollar  global and regional demand and production  and political and economic conditions 
these factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration  development or operations  or incur asset write downs at one or more of our properties 
the following table sets forth the average daily closing prices of the following metals for   and each year thereafter through silver per oz

hedging activities could expose us to losses 
from time to time  we enter into hedging activities  such as forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option contracts  to manage the metals prices received on our products and in an attempt to insulate our operating results from declines in those prices 
however  hedging may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract 
in addition  we may experience losses if a counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity or for any other reason 
at december   we had no outstanding forward sales contracts  commodity put and call options contracts or other hedging positions 
our costs are subject to currency fluctuations 
our products are sold in world markets in united states dollars  although a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies  primarily the venezuelan bolivar and mexican peso 
foreign exchange fluctuations may materially increase our production costs  future exploration activities and costs of capital 
for more specific information with regard to foreign currency as it relates to our operations in venezuela  see la camorra segment in md a 
our profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities 
our business activities are highly dependent on the costs of commodities such as fuel  steel and cement 
the recent prices for such commodities have significantly increased and have increased our costs of production and development 
a material increase in costs at any of our operating properties could have a significant effect on our profitability 
for additional discussion  see results of operations in md a 
failure to comply with debt covenants could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
in september  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement that includes various covenants and other limitations related to our indebtedness and investments that require us to maintain customary measures of financial performance 
at december   we had million outstanding under the credit agreement and were in compliance with our covenants 
we believe we will be able to comply with such requirements in the future  although failure to do so could adversely affect our results or financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations  future metals prices  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments  including long lived assets and investments  and reserves for contingencies and litigation 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information  see critical accounting policies in md a and the risk factors our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated  our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise and our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
material weaknesses relating to our internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect our financial results or condition and share price 
in our annual report on form k  management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting in place at december  were ineffective due to three material weaknesses 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
during  these material weaknesses were remediated and we reported no material weaknesses at december  however  there can be no assurance that material weaknesses regarding our internal controls will not be discovered in the future  which could result in costs to remediate such controls or inaccuracies in our financial statements 
a material weakness in controls over financial reporting may result in increased difficulty or expense in transactions  such as financings  or a risk of adverse reaction by the market generally that would result in a decrease of our stock prices 
operation  development and exploration risks our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks 
we currently conduct significant mining operations and exploration projects in venezuela and mexico 
we anticipate that we will continue to conduct significant operations in these and possibly other international locations in the future 
because we conduct operations internationally  we are subject to political and economic risks such as the effects of local political  labor and economic developments and unrest  significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate  exchange controls and export or sale restrictions  currency fluctuations and repatriation restrictions  invalidation of governmental orders  permits  or agreements  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits and contracts  recurring tax audits and delays in processing tax credits or refunds  corruption  demands for improper payments  expropriation  and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security  disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to us laws and regulations  fuel or other commodity shortages  illegal mining  laws or policies of foreign countries and the united states affecting trade  investment and taxation  civil disturbances  war and terrorist actions  and seizures of assets 
consequently  our exploration  development and production activities outside of the united states may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
for more information regarding our operations in mexico and venezuela  see md a  item property descriptions and other various risk factors relating to our foreign operations 
political  social and regulatory instability in venezuela may adversely affect us 
the success of our la camorra unit is dependent on the political  social and regulatory stability of venezuela 
we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully 
however  we face continued uncertainty relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  exportation and exchange controls  and the possible effects of all of these uncertainties on our operations 
risks due to changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages  seizures of assets  relationships with small mining groups in the vicinity of our mining operations and the impact on commodities necessary to operate  mean there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations 
any such factors or occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
specifically  we are currently subject to the following business risks in venezuela  which are discussed in more detail in md a requirement to sell of our production within venezuela 
markets for gold sales within venezuela are limited  which could result in delays in sales  lower realized sales prices and operating cash flows 
a fixed exchange rate of venezuelan currency with the us dollar  which has impacted our costs and operating cash flows 
a new criminal exchange law imposes strict sanctions  both criminal and economic  for currency exchanges outside the officially designated methods or for obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses 
we are involved in litigation with the venezuelan tax authority concerning alleged unpaid tax liabilities that predate our purchase of la camorra in  as well as tax audits of our venezuelan tax returns for the years ended december  and the venezuelan government announced its intention to rescind inactive  non compliant mining concessions and created a state agency that is responsible for exploration  exploitation  processing and industrialization of gold and other minerals in venezuela 
in february  the venezuelan national guard impounded a shipment of our dor due to alleged irregularities in documentation that accompanied the shipment 
the dor was returned to us in july of that year  and all subsequent shipments of dor have been exported without intervention by venezuelan government authorities 
our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated 
capitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate  including the lucky friday level expansion  development of mina isidora in venezuela and the recently completed shaft at the la camorra mine in venezuela  which was placed into service in august if we are unable to realize a return on these investments  we may incur a related asset write down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
our ability to sustain or increase our current level of production of metals partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and or expand existing mining operations 
before we can begin a development project  we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so 
this determination is based on estimates of several factors  including ore reserves  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  future metals prices  facility and equipment costs  availability of economic sources of power and adequacy of water supply  exploration and drilling success  capital and operating costs of a development project  environmental considerations and permitting  adequate access to the site  including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  currency exchange and repatriation risks  applicable tax rates  foreign currency fluctuation and inflation rates  political risks and regulatory climate in the foreign countries in which we operate  and availability of financing 
these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data  which may be imprecise 
as a result  actual cash operating costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates as a result of which it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project 
our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise 
our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals 
you are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves 
reserves are estimates made by our technical personnel  and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions 
our reserve estimates  particularly those for properties that have not yet started producing  may change based on actual production experience 
further  reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices  which may not be consistent among our operating and non operating properties 
the economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of the various metals we mine  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  increase in the dilution of the ore  and reduced recovery rates 
short term operating factors relating to our ore reserves  such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may adversely affect our cash flow 
we may use forward sales contracts and other hedging techniques to partially offset the effects of a drop in the market prices of the metals we mine 
however  if the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period  we could experience delays in new project development  net losses  reduced cash flow  reductions in reserves  and write downs of asset values 
efforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful  which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock 
one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
thus  we must continually replace depleted ore reserves 
our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration program 
mineral exploration  particularly for silver and gold  is highly speculative and expensive 
it involves many risks and is often nonproductive 
even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit  it may be several years before production is possible 
during that time  it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic  regulatory  political or other reasons 
as a result of high costs and other uncertainties  we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted  which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
our joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful 
it is possible we will enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties  similar to our joint venture arrangements related to the greens creek unit and hollister development block project 
in a typical joint venture arrangement  the partners own a proportionate share of the assets  are entitled to indemnification from each other party and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to its interest in the joint venture 
if a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement  we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro rata share of the joint venture 
we face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy 
mines have limited lives  which is an inherent risk in acquiring mining properties 
we are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties 
although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our investors  these pursuits are costly and often unproductive 
inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the united states and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and or production activities  and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks 
in addition to the risk associated with mines limited lives  we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices  failure to obtain permits  labor problems  changes in regulatory environment  an inability to obtain financing and other factors previously described 
acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic  political  operating  and geological risks 
in addition  we face strong competition for new properties from other mining companies  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  and we may be unable to acquire attractive new mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable 
our business depends on good relations with our employees 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers  managers  employees and other personnel including those residing outside of the us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of such employees 
we compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry in connection with the recruiting and retention of qualified employees knowledgeable in mining operations 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
many of our employees are represented by unions 
we anticipate that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with each union  although there can be no assurance that this can be done or that it can be done without disruptions to production 
during  labor strikes and work slow downs adversely affected our production in mexico and venezuela  and similar labor problems could continue to affect our financial results or condition in the future 
for additional discussion of these strikes and work slow downs  see results of operations in md a 
mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production 
production may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents  unfavorable ground conditions  work stoppages or slow downs  ore grades are lower than expected  the metallurgical characteristics of the ore are less economical than anticipated  or our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected 
our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards  political and country risks  civil unrest or terrorism  industrial accidents  labor disputes or strikes  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  cave ins  explosive rock failures  and unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
such risks could result in personal injury or fatalities  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities  environmental damage  delays in exploration  development or mining  monetary losses  and legal liability 
for some of these risks  we maintain insurance to protect against these losses at levels consistent with our historical experience  industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  too expensive for us  and  therefore  we do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flow and overall profitability 
legal  market and regulatory risks we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
there are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved 
if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us  is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise impacts our operations  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we may ultimately incur environmental remediation costs substantially in excess of the amounts we have accrued and the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings may be awarded substantial damages  which costs and damages we may not be able to recover from our insurers 
for a description of the lawsuits in which we are involved  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental and lessor approvals and permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex  time consuming and costly process 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control 
obtaining environmental permits  including the approval of reclamation plans  may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and  if obtained  that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation 
we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
our business is subject to extensive us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing development  production  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  use of toxic substances  environmental regulations  mine safety and other matters 
see risks titled our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made and our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks 
we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage or otherwise violating environmental laws  and we may be subject to similar lawsuits in the future 
new legislation and regulations may be adopted at any time that result in additional operating expense  capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining  production or development of our properties 
from time to time  the us congress considers proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
there has been no significant activity with respect to mining law reform in congress during the past several years 
the extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of us congressional action is difficult to predict 
although a majority of our existing us mining operations occur on private or patented property  changes to the general mining law  if adopted  could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands 
see also our foreign operations are subject to additional inherent risks and political  social and regulatory instability in venezuela may effect us  and item  management discussion analysis 
our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are subject to significant environmental obligations  particularly in northern idaho 
at december   we had accrued million as a provision for environmental remediation  million of which relates to our various liabilities in idaho  and there is a significant risk that the costs of remediation could materially exceed this provision 
for an overview of our potential environmental liabilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged 
unpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings  the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested 
although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings  title review does not necessary preclude third parties from challenging our title 
in accordance with mining industry practice  we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property 
therefore  while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties  some titles may be defective 
the price of our common stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future 
our common and preferred stocks are listed on the new york stock exchange 
the market price for our common shares has been volatile  often based on fluctuating proven and probable reserves  factors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects such as global economic developments and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries  changes in metals prices  particularly gold and silver  our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  foreign political and regulatory risk  the success of our exploration program  ability to meet production estimates  environmental and legal risk  the extent of analytical coverage concerning our business  and the trading volume and general market interest in our securities 
the market price of our common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long term value  and may prevent shareholders from realizing a profit on their investment 
our preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
we may not be able to pay preferred stock dividends in the future 
in july  we paid outstanding dividends in arrears on our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock totaling approximately million 
since july  we have continued to pay regular quarterly dividends on our series b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
the annual dividend payable on the preferred stock is currently million 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not declared preferred dividends since the second quarter of there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that transaction would be beneficial to stockholders 
these impediments include the rights issued in connection with our stockholder rights plan that will substantially dilute the ownership of any person or group that acquires or more of our outstanding common stock unless the rights are first redeemed by our board of directors  at its discretion 
furthermore  our board of directors may amend the terms of these rights  at its discretion  including an amendment to lower the acquisition threshold to as low as of the outstanding common stock  the classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval  a provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors  a provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our entire board of directors  a prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders  a provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock  a provision that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders  a prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the interest  or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination  and a prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock 
the existence of the stockholder rights plan and these provisions may deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell our stock at a premium over prevailing prices 
the potential inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock

item property descriptions operating properties the la camorra unit the la camorra unit refers to our venezuelan operating properties and exploration projects  which are discussed below 
for additional information with regard to our venezuelan operating properties  see the la camorra segment in md a 
at the present time  the la camorra mine is operating and development of mina isidora is continuing 
limited production of ore in from mina isidora was achieved and mina isidora will be ramping up to a full production rate in mid all ore from mina isidora is shipped to the mill at the la camorra mine for processing 
the mill uses a conventional carbon in leach process 
the ore is crushed with a three stage system consisting of a primary jaw crusher with secondary and tertiary cone crusher with a multi deck vibrating screen 
the grinding circuit includes a primary and a secondary ball mill 
the ground ore is mixed with a cyanide solution and clarified  followed by countercurrent carbon in leach gold adsorption 
the carbon is then stripped and the gold recovered and poured into gold bars for shipment to a third party refiner 
mill recovery averages approximately 
all mill equipment  infrastructure and facilities are in good condition 
the mill was constructed in and has been periodically upgraded 
the mill is capable of processing approximately tons per day 
during  we started a custom milling program for small mining cooperatives working in the area of mina isidora 
the cooperatives sell their ore to us for further processing at our la camorra mill 
see custom milling business below 
information with respect to the la camorra unit s production and average costs per ounce of gold produced is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  production ore processed tons gold ounces average cost per ounce of gold produced cash operating costs total cash costs total production costs during  and    and  tons milled  respectively  and   and  gold ounces produced were generated from our custom milling business and other purchases of ore from third parties not mined at la camorra 
cash costs per ounce of gold represent measurements that are not in accordance with gaap that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations 
we believe cash costs per ounce of gold provide an indicator of profitability and efficiency at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in item  md a  under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the la camorra mine the la camorra mine is located approximately miles southeast of puerto ordaz in the eastern venezuelan state of bolivar 
the mine is accessed via a gravel road that we maintain and is six miles east of state highway  which is a paved two lane road running from upata south to the brazilian border 
we acquired the la camorra mine in from monarch resources investments limited monarch  and it is owned by us through our venezuelan subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv 
the purchase agreement includes a provision to pay monarch a net smelter return nsr royalty on production exceeding a cumulative total of  ounces of gold from the properties acquired in venezuela from monarch 
the royalty is based on a sliding scale that is dependent on the price of gold 
when the gold price is below per troy ounce  there is no royalty  when the price is between and per troy ounce the royalty is  when the price is between and per troy ounce  the royalty is  and when the price is and above  the royalty is 
the  ounce production milestone was reached during the second quarter of gold production since that time has been subject to the provisions of the royalty agreement  the payments of which have been offset by our costs incurred related to on going tax litigation  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the la camorra mine is located on an exploration concession granted by the ministry of energy and mines in that has been converted to a fifty year exploitation license 
the mine is a high grade underground gold mine that exploits two shear zone hosted quartz veins known as the main zone and the betzy vein 
it lies in the botanamo greenstone belt of the precambrian guayana shield and is hosted by the caballape group of volcanoclastic rocks 
the formations most likely date from archean to proterozoic in age and consist primarily of intermediate volcanics with subordinate metasediments 
gold mineralization at la camorra is confined to narrow  near vertical quartz veins hosted in an east west trending  left lateral shear zone 
most economic mineralization in the la camorra veins occur in distinct ore shoots 
gold occurs both as free particles in quartz and attached to  or included in  pyrite 
locally  gold is also seen on chloritic partings 
at the end of  the principal working levels of the la camorra mine lay between the elevations of and meters below sea level 
the proven and probable reserves extend to the meter elevation and exploration drill holes have intersected gold mineralization below the current reserve limits at the meter level 
at the end of  the mine had been developed to the meter level 
engineering studies undertaken in and indicated that the combination of ventilation and haulage requirements and logistics would make mining below the meter level extremely difficult and marginally economic without the development of a shaft 
in august  the board of directors approved the development of a production shaft at the la camorra mine based on the long lead time necessary to construct the shaft and to develop further ore reserves 
the production shaft is complete and was commissioned during the second half of the shaft loading station is at the meter level and is meters below sea level 
access to the underground workings at the la camorra mine is made via the shaft and a ramp from the surface excavated at a grade and connecting numerous levels 
the main access ramp has been developed to a depth of approximately meters below sea level 
ore is mined primarily by longhole stoping and is extracted from the stopes using rubber tired equipment and hauled to the surface in mine haulage trucks and during the second half of  the production shaft 
sub economic material is used to backfill and stabilize mined out stopes 
the mine is currently producing approximately tons of ore per day 
site infrastructure  equipment and facilities are in good condition and includes a water supply system  maintenance shop  warehouse  living quarters  a dining facility  administration building and a national guard post 
we also share a housing facility located near the town of el callao with units for approximately families 
mine electric power is purchased from eleoriente a state owned electric company 
diesel powered electric generators are available on site for operation of critical equipment during power outages 
at december   the net book value of the la camorra mine property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million 
our reclamation plan has been approved by the ministry of environment and natural resources 
planned activities include regrading and revegetation of disturbed areas 
the reclamation and closure accrual as of december   was million 
at december   there were hourly and salaried employees associated with the la camorra mine 
the hourly employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  the contract for which will expire in october in addition  there were employees contracted to fill in for vacation and absentee purposes  and employees at the administrative office in puerto ordaz as of december  information with respect to the la camorra mine s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  proven and probable ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces the company s estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on a gold price of  and per ounce  respectively  in  and proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
an independent audit of the year end reserves at the la camorra mine was completed in by roscoe postle associates inc rpa 
following the audit  rpa made several recommendations for our proven and probable reserve calculation  all of which we reviewed and addressed in the proven and probable reserves  which were not subject to audit by rpa 
the year end proven and probable reserves decrease in tonnage and grade  as well as an associated decrease in ounces when compared to the year end proven and probable reserves  are a result of a combination of new drill data and underground sampling information  a revision of ore shoot limits and the depletion of reserves by mining 
the year end reserves show an increase in tonnage and decrease in grade resulting in a decrease in ounces when compared to the year end reserves 
the changes are a result of a combination of new drill data and underground sampling information  a revision of ore shoot limits and the increase in mine dilution being applied to the betzy vein material together with a depletion of reserves by mining 
proven and probable ore reserves at the la camorra mine are based on drill spacing of to meters and closely spaced chip sample information 
cutoff grade assumptions are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs 
the cutoff grade at la camorra is grams of gold per tonne 
in addition  we have the exploration rights to approximately  hectares square miles adjacent to the la camorra mine 
this property is controlled through eight different contracts with the venezuelan state owned development company  corporacion venezolana de guayana  as well as five different concessions with the ministry of basic industries and mines formerly the ministry of energy and mines 
the contracts and concessions were granted at various times with expiration dates between and  and most are renewable for a period of to years 
in  proven and probable reserves decreased at the la camorra mine as the deposit exhibited lower ore grades 
no significant exploration results were returned from drilling on the la camorra veins during in  exploration activity will focus on strike extensions to the main and betsy veins and other known veins on the concession and on the properties surrounding the mine  once the appropriate permits are granted 
the block b concessions in march  we acquired the block b exploration and mining lease near el callao in the venezuelan state of bolivar from cvg minerven  a venezuelan government owned gold mining company 
the lease runs through march the area s mining history dates back to the s 
block b is a seven square mile property position in the el callao gold mining district and contains many historic mines including the chile  laguna and panama mines  which collectively produced over million ounces of gold between and pursuant to the lease agreement  we will pay cvg minerven a royalty of to on production from block b  based on production levels 
the royalty terms are i if the price of gold is below per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment  ii if the price of gold is equal or greater than and equal to or below per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment  and iii if the price of gold is greater than per ounce of refined gold during the month preceding payment 
as a result of limited production in  million in royalty expense was incurred 
prior to inception of production  we made lease payments of  in and  in to cvg minerven 
the el callao area is accessed on a maintained  asphalt highway that runs from puerto ordaz  on the south side of the river orinoco  through to santa elena on the brazilian border 
overall good infrastructure exists and an kw electricity power line supplies the area predominantly populated by miners operating underground small scale mines 
the population of el callao is approximately  people 
geologically  the gold is found in shear zone hosted quartz veins and stockworks in proterozoic greenstone volcanics  primarily andesitic to basaltic lavas and pyroclastics 
gold occurs as free gold in quartz and is also commonly associated with coarse grained pyrite 
upon acquisition  exploration began on the chile vein system  which we believed to host high grade gold mineralization 
the chile mine itself was an important gold producer that historically produced more than  ounces of gold at an average grade of over one ounce per ton 
since the mine shut down in the s  two phases of exploration drilling were undertaken prior to our work in the block b lease area  one in the s  and more recent drill testing in the s that encountered high grades west of the old mine 
we completed a detailed exploration drilling campaign including drill holes and  meters of drilling resulting in the discovery of what we refer to as mina isidora formerly the chile mine  which we anticipate will be accessible by both a ramp and an inclined shaft 
mina isidora reported limited production during  tons  resulting in approximately  ounces of gold 
mina isidora ore is shipped to the mill at the la camorra mine for processing 
at december   the net book value for the development of mina isidora totaled million 
in addition  we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of million 
at december   there were salaried and hourly employees associated with block b 
information with respect to mina isidora s proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the table below 
years ended december  proven and probable ore reserves  total tons gold ounces per ton contained gold ounces proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
associated mining consultants  ltd  whom has referred to mina isidora as the isidora gold project within their consent included as exhibit to this document  completed an independent audit of the year end reserves at mina isidora in our estimates of proven and probable reserves were based on a gold price of  and per ounce  respectively  in  and proven and probable ore reserves at mina isidora are based on diamond drill hole spacing of to meters  geostatistical modeling 
cutoff grade assumptions are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and cash operating costs 
the changes to the mina isidora ore reserves in compared to are attributed to additional drill data  changes in modeling techniques  changes in mining assumptions and costs 
the cutoff grade at isidora is grams of gold per tonne 
outside the mina isidora area  other exploration work on the block b concessions has included geologic mapping  geophysical surveying  geochemical sampling and  meters of exploration diamond drilling 
this work has lead to the discovery of two mineralized zones  the twin and conductora mineralized zones  located approximately one kilometer northeast of the mina isidora orebody 
the twin structure was discovered through drilling during in the second quarter of  and is host to a large mineralized zone known as the twin mineralized zone 
the twin mineralized zone has a minimum strike length of meters and a minimum vertical extent of meters  and is still open down dip and along strike 
mineralization is somewhat erratic with values ranging from three grams per tonne to over grams per tonne and widths from one meter to over meters 
the gold mineralization is associated with disseminated pyrite in a moderate to strong schistose shear zone  with moderate to intense ankerite sericite alteration and minor quartz veining 
additional drilling is planned for the conductora structure  which is a possible extension to the northeast of the twin structure  is a second shear zone that has been traced over a strike length of about meters and is still open in both directions along strike and also down dip 
the structure is host to the conductora mineralized zone  which has erratic gold values associated with sulphides in narrow  quartz veins and or wide zones of quartz veinlets in moderate to intensely schistose rocks with strong ankerite sericite alteration 
geological interpretation is continuing to determine the relationship between the twin and conductora structures and mineralized zones 
the significance of the twin conductora discovery is that it outlines a previously unidentified shear structure and a new style of mineralization on the block b concession that might exist in other unexplored areas 
custom milling business during  we completed construction of a small scale crushing and sampling plant on the block b concessions that allows us to purchase ore produced from small underground mines in the area 
ores purchased from the small mines are initially crushed  sampled and assayed at the sampling plant  and then trucked to the mill at the la camorra mine for further processing 
the sampling plant is designed to process up to tons of purchased ore per day  and includes an assay lab  operated by an outside analytical assay firm  where ore samples are ground and assayed 
ore is received from small mining groups  crushed  sampled and assayed  and then payment for the ore is calculated and made to the miners generally within three days of receipt of the ore 
as a part of this program  we provide small mine operators with financing and technical assistance  including technical advice on mining techniques  grade controls and safety standards 
the small mine activity in venezuela is a significant part of the country s mining industry  and we believe working with the miners provides goodwill and develops positive relationships with local mining groups  as well as assistance to the communities that are impacted by our operations 
we have received a positive response from local and national politicians and citizens for our efforts in helping the small mining cooperatives to improve their practices  and for assisting in providing a stimulus to the local economy 
as part of the custom milling business  we enter into contracts with the small mining groups and advance funds in the form of equipment and working capital  and collect such advances from ore delivered to the sampling and crushing plant 
as of december   we had a receivable from small mining cooperatives totaling million  net of a reserve of million 
the net book value of the plant and equipment associated with the custom milling business was million at december  in addition  we had an accrual for future reclamation and closure costs of million 
the san sebastian unit the san sebastian mine is located approximately miles northeast of the city of durango  mexico  on concessions acquired in access to san sebastian is via mexico highway  approximately kilometers east of guadalupe victoria  and then approximately kilometers of paved rural road through the towns of ignacio allende and emiliano zapata 
the processing plant is located near velarde a  durango  mexico  and was acquired in april our concession holdings cover approximately square miles  including the francine vein  the don sergio vein and multiple outlying active exploration areas 
production from the francine vein has been from a high grade silver vein with significant gold credits 
production from the don sergio vein has been from a high grade gold vein with some silver credits 
mineral concession titles are obtained and held under the laws of mexico  and are valid for years with the possibility of extending another years 
there are work assessment and tax requirements that are variable and increase with the time that the concession is held 
several epithermal veins within the saladillo valley include the francine  profesor  middle and north vein systems that are proximal to each other and hosted within a series of shales with interbedded fine grained sandstones interpreted to belong to the cretaceous caracol formation 
the don sergio  jessica  andrea and antonella veins located in the cerro pedernalillo area  about six kilometers from francine  are hosted by the same formation with the addition of dioritic intrusive rocks 
underground development along the francine vein started in may  and reached full production during the second quarter of mining of economic ore on the upper francine vein was completed during the first quarter of the mine has been placed on care and maintenance as exploration continues on the property including the hugh zone  which is located several hundred meters below historic mining 
mining of economic ore on the don sergio vein was completed in the fourth quarter of and reclamation of this portion of the mine site is underway 
san sebastian s life of mine production over four years was million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold 
during  surface drilling will continue on the hugh zone 
if such results are favorable  a decision to initiate an underground exploration and feasibility program could be made before the end of the francine vein strikes northwest and dips southwest and is located on the southwestern limb of a doubly plunging anticline 
the vein ranges in true thickness from more than four meters to less than half a meter  and consists of several episodes of banded quartz  silica healed breccias and minor amounts of calcite 
the vein is oxidized to a depth of approximately vertical meters and the wall rocks contain an alteration halo of less than two meters next to the vein 
mineralization within the oxidized portion of the vein contains limonite  hematite  silver halides and various copper carbonates 
higher grade gold and silver mineralization is associated with disseminated hematite and limonite after pyrite and chalcopyrite  copper carbonates including malachite and azurite and hydrous copper silicates including chrysocolla 
native gold occurs associated with hematite and limonite 
mineralization in the sulfide portion of the francine vein contains pyrite  chalcopyrite  sphalerite  galena  native silver  argentite and trace amounts of aguilarite 
access to both underground workings has been through ramps from the surface connecting one or more levels 
ore has been mined by the cut and fill stoping method and extracted from the stopes using rubber tired equipment and hauled to the surface in trucks 
run of mine ore has been hauled in trucks by contractors to our processing facility near velarde a 
the mill has been a conventional leach  counter current decantation and merrill crowe precipitation circuit 
the ore has been crushed in a two staged crushing plant consisting of a primary jaw  a secondary cone crusher and a double deck vibrating screen 
the grinding circuit includes a primary ball mill and cyclone classifiers 
the ground ore has been thickened followed by agitated leaching and four stages of counter current decantation to wash solubilized silver and gold from the pulp 
the solution bearing silver and gold has been clarified  deaerated and zinc dust added to precipitate silver and gold that is recovered in plate and frame filters 
the precious metal precipitate was smelted and refined into dor  and was then shipped to a third party refiner 
processing of economic ore was completed during the fourth quarter of  and the mill has been placed on care and maintenance 
at december   the net book value of the san sebastian unit property and its associated plant and equipment was million 
the mill was constructed in and is capable of processing approximately tons per day 
site infrastructure includes a water supply system  maintenance shop  warehouse  laboratory  tailings impoundment and various offices 
equipment and facilities  including the mill  are in good condition and have been supported by ongoing diagnostic and preventative maintenance programs 
long term future operations at the mill would require replacement of the water supply pipeline 
as of december   million has been accrued for reclamation and closure costs  and there were hourly and salaried employees performing exploration  care and maintenance  reclamation and security functions 
due to the curtailment of mining activity  the collective bargaining agreement with the national mine and mill workers union for hourly mill employees was terminated during the fourth quarter of electric power is purchased from comisi n federal de electricidad a mexico federal electric company 
information with respect to the san sebastian unit s production  average cost per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves are set forth in the table below 
years ended december  production ore milled tons silver ounces gold ounces average cost per ounce of silver produced  cash operating costs total cash costs total production costs proven and probable ore reserves  total tons silver ounces per ton gold ounces per ton contained silver ounces contained gold ounces silver and gold production during was impacted by a strike initiated in october  by hourly employees at the velarde a mill  as well as by the curtailment of mining activity discussed above 
the strike ended in june  with a satisfactory labor agreement that we believe will not inhibit our ability to work in the area in the future 
the low costs per silver ounce are due in part to significant by product credits from gold production and an increase in price over the last three years 
for the years ended december   and  gold by product credits were approximately  and per silver ounce  respectively  and were deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs per ounce 
if our accounting policy had been changed to treat gold production as a co product  the following total cash costs per ounce would have been reported silver gold cash costs per ounce of silver represent measurements that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations that are not in accordance with gaap 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver provide an indicator of profitability and efficiency at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties

our estimates of proven and probable reserves have been based on the following metals prices december  silver gold proven and probable reserves were exhausted during the fourth quarter of the greens creek unit we hold a interest in the greens creek unit through a joint venture arrangement with kennecott greens creek mining company and kennecott juneau mining company 
the term of the joint venture arrangement continues for years after the effective date may  and for so long thereafter as products are produced from the properties or the participants continue to have an ownership interest in the assets  unless the arrangement is terminated earlier or is extended 
the partners of the joint venture arrangement are obligated to contribute funds to adopted programs in proportion to their respective participating interests 
a participant s interest in the joint venture arrangement would change upon election to contribute less to an adopted budget than the percentage reflected by its participating interest  in the event of a participant s default in making its agreed upon contribution to an adopted budget  followed by the election of the other participant to invoke remedies as permitted in the agreement  transfer by a participant of less than all of its participating interest in accordance with the terms of the agreement  or acquisition by a participant of some or all of the other participant s interest  however arising 
the greens creek orebody contains silver  zinc  gold and lead  and lies adjacent to the admiralty island national monument  an environmentally sensitive area 
the greens creek property includes patented lode claims and one patented mill site claim  in addition to property leased from the us forest service 
greens creek also has title to mineral rights on  acres of federal land adjacent to the properties 
the entire project is accessed and served by miles of road and consists of the mine  an ore concentrating mill  a tailings impoundment area  a ship loading facility  camp facilities and a ferry dock 
the greens creek deposit is a polymetallic  stratiform  massive sulfide deposit 
the host rock consists of predominantly marine sedimentary  and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks  which have been subjected to multiple periods of deformation 
these deformational episodes have imposed intense tectonic fabrics on the rocks 
mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites and a structural footwall of graphitic and calcareous argillite 
major sulfide minerals are pyrite  sphalerite  galena  and tetrahedrite tennanite 
pursuant to a land exchange agreement  the joint venture transferred private property equal to a value of million to the us forest service and received exploration and mining rights to approximately  acres of land with mining potential surrounding the existing mine 
production from new ore discoveries on the exchanged lands will be subject to federal royalties included in the land exchange agreement 
the royalty is only due on production from reserves that are not part of greens creek s extralateral rights 
thus far  there has been no discovery triggering payment of the royalty 
the royalty is if the average value of the ore during a year is greater than per ton of ore  and if the value is per ton or less 
the benchmark of per ton is escalated annually by the gross domestic product percentage increase until the year greens creek is an underground mine which produces approximately  tons of ore per day 
the primary mining methods are cut and fill and longhole stoping 
the ore is processed on site at a mill  which produces lead  zinc and bulk concentrates  as well as dor containing silver and gold 
the dor is sold to a precious metal refiner and the three concentrate products are sold to a number of major smelters worldwide 
concentrates are shipped from a marine terminal located on admiralty island about nine miles from the mine site 
the greens creek unit is currently powered by diesel generators located on site 
however  an agreement was reached during to purchase excess hydroelectric power from the local power company  and installation of the necessary infrastructure is expected to be complete during the first half of it is estimated that to of the diesel generated power will be replaced  as a result of this project  through construction of a new hydroelectric plant by the local power company is anticipated by  at which time it is estimated that it will have the capacity to supply of greens creek power 
the employees at greens creek are employees of kennecott greens creek mining company  and are not represented by a bargaining agent 
there were employees at the greens creek unit at december  our interest in the net book value of the greens creek unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million 
all equipment  infrastructure and facilities  including camp and concentrate storage facilities  are in good condition 
as of december   we have accrued million for reclamation and closure costs 
a reclamation trust fund has been established and funded for million  into which we have paid approximately million 
this fund replaced other forms of security that had been provided to regulatory agencies 
kennecott greens creek mining company s geology and engineering staff computes the estimated ore reserves for the greens creek unit with technical support from rio tinto plc 
we review geologic interpretation and reserve methodology  but the reserve compilation is not independently confirmed by us in its entirety

estimates of proven and probable ore reserves for the greens creek unit as of december  and are derived from successive generations of reserve and feasibility analyses for different areas of the mine each using a separate assessment of metals prices 
the weighted average prices used were december  silver gold lead zinc ore reserves represent in place material  diluted and adjusted for expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries of ore reserve grades differ by ore zones and are expected to be in the range of for silver  for gold  for zinc and for lead 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to depletion by mining 
additional information from drilling and sampling resulted only in minor reserve increases that did not offset production 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to addition of new drill data  increases in forecast precious metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates for certain orebodies  partially offset by depletion due to production 
proven and probable reserves at the greens creek unit are based on average drill spacing of to feet 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by orebody and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
cutoff grades range from per ton net smelter return to per ton net smelter return 
independent reviews by amec e c  inc were completed for reserve models in for the south  and southwest bench deposits  and in for the northwest west zones 
no third party reviews were conducted in the lucky friday unit since  we have owned and operated the lucky friday unit  a deep underground silver and lead mine located in the coeur d alene mining district in northern idaho 
lucky friday is one quarter mile east of mullan  idaho  and is adjacent to us interstate the principal ore bearing structure mined at the lucky friday unit through was the lucky friday vein  a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d alene mining district 
the orebody is located in the revett formation  which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of orebodies in the coeur d alene mining district 
the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet 
its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite 
the ore occurs as a single continuous orebody in and along the lucky friday vein 
the major part of the orebody has extended from the  foot level to and below the  foot level 
during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high grade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property  approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings 
this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the level 
we control the gold hunter property under a long term operating agreement with independence lead mines company independence expiring in february and renewable thereafter  that entitles us  as operator  to an interest in the net profits from operations from the gold hunter property 
we will be obligated to pay a net profits interest of to independence after we have recouped our costs to explore and develop the property 
as of december   unrecouped costs totaled approximately million 
all of our commitments under the operating agreement have been met 
for a description of a legal claim involving the lucky friday unit and independence  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access  cut and fill 
this method utilizes rubber tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the orebody 
once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein  it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed  either above or below  from the ramp system 
the ore produced from lucky friday is processed in a  ton per day conventional flotation mill 
in  ore was processed at a rate of approximately tons per day 
the flotation process produces both a silver lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  lead and zinc

our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices december  silver lead zinc reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
we are currently developing the level  which is expected to reach full production levels in mid due to increased data made possible from this development  proven and probable reserves reported at december   doubled after accounting for production during the changes in reserves in versus are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work together with increases in forecast metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
ultimate reclamation activities contemplated include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed in  and at december   approximately million had been accrued for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant and equipment was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to  and are in good physical condition 
in  we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries 
additions included a third stage crushing system  increased flotation capacity and a new flash cell  new column cells and tailings thickeners 
the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside trade specialists as required 
at december   there were employees at the lucky friday unit

the earn in agreement  as modified by the parties in march  provides us with an option to earn a working interest in hollister in return for funding the first stage of an advanced exploration and development program and funding of the second stage 
we estimate the cost to achieve our interest to be a maximum of million  with our share of the total project to reach full production levels at approximately million 
we are the manager of the exploration and development activities and if we complete earn in activities  and if we achieve successful exploration results and upon completion of a favorable feasibility study  we will be the operator of the property 
our project costs through total million 
hollister is defined by a  foot by  foot project boundary  or acres  within a larger claim block held by newmont mining corporation and great basin gold 
the most recent operation was the hollister mine  operated from through  consisting of two open pit gold mines and a heap leach facility 
the underground exploration project consists of approximately  feet of underground excavation  including a decline access to the mineralized structures  crosscuts  diamond drill stations  muck bays and miscellaneous openings 
approximately  to  tons of bulk samples from the different veins within the system are planned  along with approximately  feet of diamond drilling from underground locations 
surface support facilities for the underground exploration project are located in the existing east hollister pit  thereby limiting most surface disturbance to areas associated with previous mining activities 
in  construction of the surface facilities was completed and physical exploration efforts underground continued 
by the end of  a total of  feet of openings had been created  and one of the veins had been intersected 
forty nine full time employees work on the project  with an additional eight contractor part time employees performing support roles 
all surface facilities and systems have been installed and are operational  with the exception of the waste rock dump evaporation sump 
the originally conceived sump system has not been constructed due to high groundwater levels below the surface 
modifications to the sump design have been approved by federal and state regulatory agencies 
in  we anticipate completing physical exploration by driving another  feet of openings  and to complete approximately  additional feet of diamond drilling from underground drill platforms 
metallurgical testing is expected to be conducted  negotiations with potential milling facilities are likely to be pursued and a feasibility study is expected to be compiled 
a decision on the viability of a commercial operation is anticipated to be made during if a production decision was not favorable  closure and reclamation activities would commence pursuant to the stipulations in the earn in agreement 
in april  hecla ventures corporation filed a lawsuit in elko county  nevada  against great basin and rodeo creek gold inc  to resolve contractual disagreements involving the earn in agreement 
in march  the parties agreed to amend the original earn in agreement to reflect changing conditions at the project  revise certain deadlines and to dismiss all litigation 
the main modifications to the earn in agreement were as follows we have committed to complete and fund of the remaining stage earn in activities by march   we and great basin will fund stage equally  although we will fund great basin s stage activities until we deliver the feasibility study  at which time great basin will reimburse us for their stage expenses  if the decision is made to develop and operate a mine  we must achieve full production by august  as a condition of earning a working interest in the project  we are entitled to the proceeds of the first  ounces of gold or equivalent up to the actual costs of stage activities plus  not to exceed million  from stage activities  thereafter any revenues will be shared equally  and we and great basin have agreed to terminate the litigation

exploration properties noche buena noche buena is located in the state of sonora  mexico  miles northwest of caborca  and is owned through our wholly owned subsidiary  minera hecla  sa de sa purchased in   hectares are held under two concessions 
an operating permit was received in in early  we initiated an updated feasibility study  and since have drilled  meters of core in holes  which were added to an existing database containing results from  meters of core drilling in holes and  meters of reverse circulation drilling in holes 
a new geologic interpretation was completed along with an updated model 
other activities have included collecting samples for additional column leach tests  engineering studies for an open pit heap leaching operation and investigations into updating the existing operating permit 
we completed the feasibility study in and determined the project did not meet our economic requirements 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected to market the concessions 
several companies have expressed interest in acquiring noche buena and at december   we had granted one such company exclusive right to evaluate the property in detail and are continuing to negotiate in an effort to reach a definitive agreement  although there can be no assurance this evaluation and negotiation will result in the sale of noche buena 
idle properties the grouse creek mine the grouse creek gold mine is located in central idaho  miles southwest of the town of challis in the yankee fork mining district 
mining at grouse creek began in late and ended in april  due to higher than expected operating costs and less than expected operating margins  primarily because the ore occurred in thinner  less continuous structures than had been originally expected 
in  we notified state and federal agencies that the grouse creek mine would proceed to a permanent suspension of operations 
we signed an agreement with the state of idaho and a voluntary administrative order on consent with the us forest service and us environmental protection agency the agencies in which we agreed to dewater the tailings impoundment  complete a water balance report and monitoring plan for the site  and complete certain studies necessary for closure of the tailings impoundment 
the voluntary administrative order on consent requires that a work plan for final reclamation and closure of the tailings impoundment be submitted by us no later than one year prior to estimated completion of the tailings impoundment dewatering  currently anticipated to be in we currently expect the work plan to be submitted to us during the third quarter of in  we received authorization from the agencies to start direct discharge of tailings impoundment waters  with the discharge process ongoing to date 
as of december   approximately of the site area has been reclaimed 
projects completed through include demolition of mill facility and site cleanup  reclamation of exploration roads and drill pads in the grouse deposit area  reclamation of acres around the waste rock storage facility and sunbeam pit  reshaping and stabilization of slopes below the grouse underground haul road  hydroseeding and revegetation of approximately acres  application of soil supplements to reclaimed areas  and stockpiling rock and topsoil for future reclamation 
by mid  the tailings impoundment is expected to be sufficiently dewatered for reclamation to begin within the impoundment 
the reclamation cost estimate includes costs of site reclamation as well as administration  water management  and closure planning 
the reclamation accrual balance as of december   was million

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a precious metals company engaged in the exploration and development of mineral properties and the mining and processing of silver  gold  lead and zinc  primarily in the united states  mexico and venezuela  and generate revenues  income and cash flows from the sale of these metals 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto 
looking back during  we believe that we continued to lay the foundation for long term growth of our operations through significant investments in exploration and development on or near our existing operating properties 
our focus was to continue progress on major capital projects underway  exploration and development of new and existing targets and low cost production 
we increased expenditures with respect to exploration and pre development activities in each of the past three years and we anticipate to continue this level of expenditure in during  we accomplished the following completion of a production shaft at the la camorra mine in venezuela  significantly advanced development of the level expansion at lucky friday in idaho and mina isidora in venezuela  both of which are expected to report increased production in  doubled proven and probable silver ounce reserves at lucky friday after accounting for production  construction of surface facilities was completed and physical exploration efforts underground continued at the hollister development block in nevada 
by the end of  a total of  feet of openings had been created  and one of the veins had been intersected  the discovery of the hugh zone at the san sebastian unit  and completion of a processing plant upgrade project at lucky friday 
our commitment to growth has impacted our bottom line  resulting in net losses of million in and million and million in and  respectively 
we recorded cash flow used in operations of million in  from cash flow provided by operations of million in and million in capital expenditures were over million in both and  up from million spent in our debt balance went to million outstanding at december   under a new million revolving credit facility entered into in september  from no balance outstanding at december  during  we filed two shelf registration statements with the securities and exchange commission sec 
in july  we filed a registration statement that allows us to sell up to million in common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt in order to raise capital for general corporate purposes 
in december  we filed a registration statement that allows us to issue up to million in common stock and warrants in connection with business combination transactions 
both registration statements have been declared effective by the sec 
we have not issued securities pursuant to either of these registration statements 
in january  we sold our shares of alamos gold inc  generating a million pre tax gain and netting million of cash proceeds 
in late and early  we acquired our interest in alamos for approximately million  which is recorded at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet at december  and  under short term investments million 
looking forward in  we anticipate production of approximately million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold  reduction of capital expenditures below the current level  completion of mine development projects at lucky friday and mina isidora  and continuation of our exploration efforts on all existing operations or concessions  including the hugh zone in mexico  where drilling will continue and the decision to initiate an underground exploration and feasibility program could be made by the end of the year  and the hollister development block  where underground drilling will take place  with the anticipation of completing a feasibility study in on whether the deposit will be economically feasible to mine 
our strategy to increase production and expand our proven and probable reserves is to be implemented by development and exploration  as well as potential future acquisitions 
one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
this has been the case historically  although despite a year operating history at lucky friday  at december   we are reporting as many or more proven and probable reserves there than at any other time 
in  we anticipate exploration and pre development expenses of approximately million in the united states  million in mexico  and million in venezuela  with potential for an additional million in mexico where we may pursue underground exploration on san sebastian s hugh zone 
we continue to face risks associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities and it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities may change in the future 
for a more comprehensive discussion of our environmental litigation and liabilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with our environmental policy  our operating activities will be conducted in a manner that attempts to minimize risks to public health and safety 
we believe that natural resources can be developed and utilized in a manner consistent with proper stewardship for the environment and our projects will be designed and managed in an attempt to reasonably minimize risk and mitigate negative impacts to the environment 
we will continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of approximately million  compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the increased loss in was primarily the result of the following a strike at our velarde a mill and the suspension of mine and mill operations at our san sebastian unit  which prevented production for six months in see further discussion in the san sebastian segment section below  decreased production and operating income at our la camorra unit due to a work slowdown initiated by a new labor union  lower gold ore grades and higher labor and material costs see the la camorra segment section below  increased exploration costs due to continued exploration efforts in venezuela on the block b concessions and at our la camorra mine  and in mexico  increased pre production development costs  as we continued advancement of the underground exploration decline at the hollister development block gold project in nevada  rising fuel  steel and cement prices that impacted most of our operations during  and increased general and administrative costs see further discussion in the corporate matters section below 
these negative effects were partially offset by the following increased average prices for all metals produced at our operations  and increased production and operating income at our greens creek and lucky friday units see greens creek segment and lucky friday segment sections below 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded losses applicable to common shareholders of approximately million per common share  million per common share and million per common share  respectively  which included preferred stock dividends of million  million and million 
the and dividends included non cash charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to exchanges of preferred stock for common stock 
in  all preferred dividends previously not declared and in arrears have been paid 
the la camorra segment the table below provides a comparison of operating results and key production statistics for our la camorra unit  which consisted of the la camorra mine  a custom milling business and exploration and development activities on the block b concessions for the years ended december   and during  we commenced development of an additional operating gold property  mina isidora  which is located on the block b concessions 
mina isidora reported limited production during  and is anticipated to reach full production by mid in thousands  except production statistics years ended december  sales cost of sales and other direct production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization exploration expense foreign exchange gains losses and other income expense income loss from operations tons of ore milled gold ounces produced gold ounce per ton total cash cost per gold ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
income from operations at the la camorra unit decreased by over during compared to  and by during compared to  primarily due to the following lower production of gold in  caused by an decrease in the gold ore grade  a strike at our la camorra mine  which suspended operations for days during the third quarter of  although labor issues continued to affect operational output that considerably lowered planned production  escalating costs due to higher cost of mining at greater depths at the la camorra mine  which are anticipated to be reduced in the future due to the recently competed shaft  increased exploration expenditures  decreased foreign exchange gains that reduced cost of sales due to our inability to access us dollars outside venezuela as discussed further below under criminal exchange law  costs of establishing the custom milling operation and block b activities  and a foreign exchange loss in march due to an increase in the government fixed exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar at  to previously set at  to 
in order to mine more efficiently at the greater depths of the la camorra mine and potentially develop further proven and probable reserves  in we made the decision to construct a production shaft based on the long lead time necessary to construct the shaft 
we completed construction of the shaft  which was placed into service during the third quarter of in  proven and probable ore reserves decreased  as the mine exhibits lower ore grades  and no significant results were returned from drilling on the la camorra veins 
we have commenced depreciation of the shaft  for which we had million in depreciation expense as of december   which also contributed to the negative variances in operating results when compared to the period 
declining proven and probable ore reserves at a lower ore grade will have an impact on any decisions for longer term plans at the la camorra mine 
the negative factors above were partially offset by a and increase in the realized price of gold in versus and versus  respectively per ounce in  in and in 
our realized gold prices during and were less than the average london final price by and per ounce due to forward gold sales contracts at per ounce for a portion of our production 
we delivered on all outstanding forward gold sales contracts by the end of the construction of the production shaft was more costly than originally anticipated and we are disputing some of the shaft construction costs submitted by the contractor 
pursuant to the construction agreement  we submitted the matter to arbitration in november the contractor has asserted million more in construction costs that we dispute 
we claim approximately million in damages against the contractor for various claims and back charges related to the construction of the shaft 
we believe we have grounds to dispute the claims  although there can be no assurance that the matter will be arbitrated in our favor and we may have to pay additional amounts for construction costs 
business risks in venezuela export of production the central bank of venezuela maintains regulations concerning the export of gold from venezuela 
under current regulations  of our gold production from venezuela is required to be sold in venezuela 
prior to our acquisition of the la camorra mine  the previous owners had sold substantially all of the gold production to the central bank of venezuela and built up a significant credit to cover the requirement  which we assumed upon our acquisition 
since we began operating in venezuela in  all of our production of gold has been exported and no sales have been made in the venezuelan market 
in may  we applied for a waiver with the central bank of venezuela on the requirement to sell of our gold in country  however  no action has been taken 
in june  the central bank of venezuela informally notified us that our past credits for local sales had been exhausted  and that we would have to withhold of our production from export 
markets within venezuela are limited  and historically the central bank of venezuela has been the primary customer of gold 
there can be no assurance that the central bank of venezuela will purchase gold from us and we may be required to sell gold into a limited market  which could result in lower sales and cash flows from gold as a result of discounts 
as of december   our product inventory included  ounces of gold in product inventory until such time as we find a suitable purchaser within venezuela for our gold or the central bank of venezuela grants us a waiver of its requirement 
product inventory at la camorra was million at december   compared to million at december   for which the increase also resulted in the lower sales reported by the la camorra unit in criminal exchange law the venezuelan government announced new regulations effective april   and a new criminal exchange law effective october   which affect the export of goods and services from venezuela 
the criminal exchange law imposes strict sanctions  criminal and economic  for the exchange of venezuelan currency with other foreign currency  except through officially designated methods  or for obtaining foreign currency under false pretenses 
under the criminal exchange law  the government of venezuela may impose penalties on anyone in violation 
as mentioned above  the venezuelan government has fixed the exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar  however  markets outside of venezuela have reflected a devaluation of the venezuelan currency from such fixed rates 
prior to the criminal exchange law  we recognized foreign exchange gains of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  which partially offset costs recorded for capital expenditures  cost of goods sold and exploration activities 
during the fourth quarter of  the criminal exchange law impacted our costs and venezuelan cash flows and could continue to do so in the future  as well as impact our profitability of operations and gold production 
there can be no assurance that further developments or interpretations of venezuelan laws and regulations are limited to the impact we have described herein 
seniat our wholly owned subsidiary  minera hecla venezolana  ca mhv  which owns and operates our la camorra mine  is involved in litigation with the venezuelan tax authority seniat concerning alleged unpaid tax liabilities that predate our purchase of la camorra from monarch resources investments limited monarch in pursuant to our purchase agreement  monarch has assumed defense of and responsibility for a pending tax case in the superior tax court in caracas 
in april  seniat filed with the superior tax court in bolivar city  state of bolivar  an embargo action against all of mhv s assets in venezuela to secure the alleged unpaid tax liabilities 
in order to prevent the embargo  in april  mhv made a cash deposit with the court of approximately million  at exchange rates in effect at that time 
in june  the superior tax court in caracas ordered suspension and revocation of the embargo action filed by seniat  although the court has maintained the million until such tax liabilities are settled 
in october  mhv and seniat reached a mutual agreement to settle the case  which is awaiting approval by the court 
the terms of the agreement provide that mhv pay approximately million in exchange for a release of the alleged tax liabilities and release of the cash bond 
in a separate agreement  monarch will reimburse mhv for all amounts in settling the case  including defense costs  through a reduction in mhv s royalty obligations to them 
although we believe the cash deposit will continue to prevent any further action by seniat with respect to the embargo related with this case and that mhv s settlement efforts will be successful  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this proceeding until a final settlement is executed and entered by the court 
if the tax court in caracas or an appellate court were to subsequently award seniat the previously requested embargo  it could disrupt our venezuela operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
in february  we were notified by seniat that it had completed its audit of our venezuelan tax returns for the years ended december  and in the notice  seniat has alleged that certain expenses are not deductible for income tax purposes and that calculations of tax deductions based upon inflationary adjustments were overstated  and has issued an assessment that is equal to taxes payable of million 
we have reviewed seniat s findings and have submitted an appeal 
any resolution could be significantly delayed  and involve further legal proceedings  additional related costs and further uncertainty 
we have not accrued any amounts associated with the tax audits as of december  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against the tax assessment  that there will not be additional assessments in the future  or that seniat or other governmental agencies or officials will not take other actions against us  whether or not justified  which  in each case  could disrupt our operations in venezuela and have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
in october  we responded to news articles concerning an accounting review of our taxes to be performed by seniat in response to claims of irregularities by the local labor union  which had recently been replaced 
we have not received notice of an audit from seniat regarding such a review  although we have undergone such reviews in the past with satisfactory results 
we believe any future review by seniat will be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties  although there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our venezuelan operations 
venezuelan state mining company in september  the venezuelan government announced its intention to rescind inactive  non compliant mining concessions and incorporate a state mining company  which would administer such mining rights 
in december  the government authorized the creation of empresa de producion social minera nacional  ca  which will be responsible for exploration  exploitation  processing and industrialization of gold and other minerals in venezuela 
we have several mining contracts  two concessions and one lease  which could be subject to review 
to the best of our knowledge  we have fully complied with the requirements necessary to maintain our concessions 
however  there can be no assurance we will be able to comply with these requirements in the future or that a state mining company will not adversely affect our ability to develop and operate our venezuelan properties 
additionally  we believe we have gone beyond the mandated requirements in community and social development  and believe we are generally perceived as having an overall positive impact on the region 
seizure of assets in february  the venezuelan national guard impounded a shipment of approximately  ounces of gold dor produced by us  allegedly due to irregularities in documentation that accompanied the shipment 
in june  the superior tax court in caracas ordered the return of our impounded gold  which had been stored at the central bank of venezuela 
although we encountered difficulties  delays and costs in enforcing such order  the impounded gold was returned in july all subsequent shipments of gold dor have been exported without intervention by venezuelan government authorities  although there can be no assurance that such impoundments will not occur in the future or  that  if such were to occur  they would be resolved in a similar manner or time frame or upon acceptable conditions or costs 
other although we believe we will be able to manage and operate the la camorra unit and related exploration projects successfully  there is a continued uncertainty relating to political  regulatory  legal enforcement  security and economic matters  as well as exportation and exchange control 
this uncertain state of affairs could affect our operations  including changes in policy or demands of governmental agencies or their officials  litigation  labor stoppages  seizures of assets  relationships with small mining groups in the vicinity of our mining operations  and an impact on our supplies of oil  gas and other supplies 
as a result  there can be no assurance we will be able to operate without interruptions to our operations  and any such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
the san sebastian segment the following is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our san sebastian segment and various exploration activities in mexico dollars are in thousands years ended december  sales cost of sales and other direct production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization exploration expense foreign exchange gain loss income loss from operations tons of ore milled silver ounces produced gold ounces produced silver ounces per ton gold ounces per ton total cash cost per silver ounce gold by product credits gold by product credit per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the loss from operations and the decrease in income from operations in  compared to  resulted primarily from two factors a strike at our velarde a mill  which prevented production during most of the fourth quarter of and first half of  and the conclusion of certain operations in october  as we reached the end of the known mine life on the francine and don sergio veins 
the strike was initiated by the national miners union in october in an attempt to unionize employees at the san sebastian mine 
during the strike  costs related to our mining operations were included in the valuation of our stockpile inventory  while costs related to the idle mill were expensed as incurred 
the mine and mill are currently on care and maintenance status as we continue exploration efforts there 
gold has been considered a by product credit at the san sebastian unit 
the significant increases in by product credit per silver ounce in our total cash cost per silver ounce produced calculation in from and  were due to higher average gold prices for each year  and the reduction in silver ounces produced as discussed above 
while value from by product gold has been significant for san sebastian  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with gold as a by product  was appropriate because we have historically presented san sebastian as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  san sebastian is in a mining district historically identified with silver  exploration has been directed toward silver  and recent exploration results have shown a predominant silver content  and our mining methods and production planning target silver as our primary product  which has been accompanied by a significant gold presence 
costs related to the velarde a mill strike and care and maintenance of the mine and mill of million were not included in the calculation of total cash costs per ounce  while in  the total cash costs per ounce calculation excluded strike related costs of million 
the greens creek segment the following is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our greens creek segment dollars are in thousands and reflect our share years ended december  sales cost of sales and other direct production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization exploration expense income from operations tons of ore milled silver ounces produced gold ounces produced zinc tons produced lead tons produced silver ounces per ton gold ounces per ton zinc percent lead percent total cash cost per silver ounce by product credits by product credit per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in reconciliation of total cash costs to costs non gaap of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in income from operations during  compared to was primarily the result of higher average metals prices and improved silver ore grades  partially offset by the effects of mine rehabilitation work and higher diesel prices 
allocation of equipment and manpower resources to rehabilitation work related to ground falls in various areas of the mine negatively affected production during the second half of the improvement in income from operations during compared to was primarily attributed to higher average metals prices 
the greens creek operation is currently powered by diesel generators  and therefore  production costs have been significantly affected by increasing fuel prices 
as a result  infrastructure is currently being installed that will allow hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by alaska electric light and power company ael p  via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
the submarine cable and substations on north douglas island are in place  electric poles and transmission lines have been installed  and the expected project completion date is during the first half of ael p has agreed to supply its excess power to greens creek  which will replace an estimated to of the diesel generated power through completion of a new hydroelectric plant by ael p is anticipated by  at which time it is estimated they will supply of greens creek power 
this project is anticipated to reduce production costs at greens creek in the future 
the increase in total cash costs per silver ounce in  compared to  is due to higher production costs  partially offset by increased by product credits  as the prices for gold  lead and zinc have continued to rise 
the decrease in total cash cost per silver ounce in  versus  is also attributed to improved by product credits 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  and in most of its working areas  greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset increases in operating costs due to increased prices 
the lucky friday segment the following is a comparison of the operating results and key production statistics of our lucky friday segment dollars are in thousands years ended december  sales cost of sales and other direct production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization exploration expense income from operations tons of ore milled silver ounces produced lead tons produced zinc tons produced silver ounces per ton lead percent zinc percent total cash cost per silver ounce by product credits by product credit per silver ounce a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found below in reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
the increase in operating income in  compared to and  primarily resulted from higher average metals prices  partially offset by increased costs related to mining at greater depth 
full production on the level expansion is expected to be reached in approximately  ounces of silver were mined from the level during  with the revenue associated with those ounces offsetting capital costs incurred with the project 
this deposit is located on property we have been mining at the lucky friday unit for the past several years under a long term lease agreement negotiated in the increase in total cash costs per silver ounce in  as compared to and  is attributed to increased production costs and longer ore haulage  partially offset by improved by product credits in each year resulting from increasing average lead and zinc prices 
while value from lead and zinc is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver accounts for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset increases in operating costs due to the increased average prices 
total cash costs per ounce at lucky friday are anticipated to decrease beginning in  a result of increased production from the level expansion  as well as  increased efficiencies of newly installed mill components during the fourth quarter of additions to the mill included a third stage crushing system  increased flotation capacity and a new flash cell  new column cells and tailings thickeners 
corporate matters the following are explanations of significant variances affecting the results of our operations as compared to accruals made for closed operations and environmental matters decreased significantly during  as accrual increases were recorded in for estimated future environmental and reclamation expenditures in idaho s coeur d alene basin million and for the grouse creek mine clean up in central idaho million for additional information on the accruals made in  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and the grouse creek mine property description in part i  item  the increase in pre development expense is due to increased activity at the hollister development block in nevada  higher general and administrative expenses in  the result of increased accounting and audit fees  increased stock compensation accruals and increased employee medical costs  lower income tax provision due to variances in foreign withholding taxes payable and foreign income taxes payable for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  increased other operating expenses due to increased foreign exchange losses in venezuela and higher corporate insurance  severance and legal expenditures  partially offset by reduced expenses related to variable plan accounting on certain stock options  and increased interest income from recovery of value added taxes from the government of mexico  offset by lower interest income of decreased cash balances 
significant variances relating to results of operations compared to are as follows general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to the addition of personnel  offset by decreased employee incentive compensation  increased exploration expense  the result of increased exploration in mexico on the don sergio vein  areas at or near san sebastian and at the noche buena project in northern mexico  and in venezuela on the block b concessions and at or near the la camorra mine  pre development costs increased due to increased activity at the hollister development block  other operating expenses  net of other operating income  increased primarily due to a one time million cash litigation settlement received during and increased legal  consulting and accounting costs incurred in related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  partially offset by decreased accruals related to variable plan accounting on certain stock options  the provision for closed operations and environmental matters was substantially lower than the provision  due to higher accruals in for the coeur d alene basin million and the grouse greek mine clean up million  interest income decreased  due to interest received in from the mexican government on unpaid value added tax balances  partially offset by increased income generated from short term investments  interest expense decreased significantly  the result of lower average borrowings  including no outstanding debt at december   increased income tax provision  as a result of an increase in the deferred tax provision relating to an increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets in mexico  and a positive cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  relating to the adoption of sfas no

costs totaling million and million have been excluded from the determination of silver costs per ounce in and  respectively  as they relate to the strike at the velarde a mill during the fourth quarter of and for most of the first six month of  and the curtailment of mining activity during the fourth quarter of these costs are not representative of operating costs 
gold has been accounted for as a by product at the san sebastian unit whereby revenues from gold have been deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs per ounce

in july  we filed a registration statement that allows us to sell up to million in common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt in order to raise capital for general corporate purposes 
in december  we filed a registration statement that allows us to issue up to million in common stock and warrants in connection with business combination transactions 
both registration statements have been declared effective by the sec 
we have not issued securities pursuant to either of these registration statements 
in september  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement for an initial two year term  with the right to extend the facility  for two additional one year periods  on terms acceptable to us and the lender 
under the credit agreement  we are subject to various covenants and other limitations related to our indebtedness and investments  as well as other information and reporting requirements 
during  we incurred loan initiation  commitment and legal fees of million related to the establishment of the facility 
at december   the outstanding balance on the revolving line was million 
we have pledged our interest in the greens creek joint venture as collateral under the credit agreement 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  we sold our shares of alamos gold inc  generating a million pre tax gain and netting million of cash proceeds 
in late and early  we acquired our interest in alamos for approximately million  which is recorded at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet at december  and  under short term investments 
the unrealized gain at december   was million and was included as a component of shareholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income 
operating activities operating activities used cash of million in  in contrast to cash provided in totaling million 
the most significant change over the two years was a million increase in our net loss in compared to  primarily due to increased pre development activity at the hollister development block and by decreased income from operations from our la camorra and san sebastian units totaling million 
in addition  the non cash elements affecting net loss were million lower in due to higher recognition in of a provision for reclamation and closure costs 
however  working capital  which increased in both years  required million less cash in than in  due substantially to collections of value added taxes  decreased working capital for the custom milling operation in venezuela and liquidation of most of our inventory at the san sebastian operation 
conversely  product inventory in venezuela increased in due to a requirement that of our sales be within the country  which we had not yet met as of december  investing activities we used million less cash for investing activities in than in our restricted investments used million less cash in as we deposited million for a greens creek reclamation surety and in venezuela in in addition  net liquidations of short term investments other than equity securities yielded million cash in  million more than in however  additions to properties  plants  and equipment were million higher in due to completion of the shaft project in venezuela  a mill upgrade project at lucky friday and ongoing development costs at lucky friday and mina isidora  and we used million more in than for purchase of available for sale securities 
financing activities financing activities  nearly breakeven in  used million less cash than in net repayments of debt in contrasted with net borrowings in by a total of million as we ended the year debt free  but ended the year with a balance of million on our revolving credit facility 
a use of cash in that did not occur in was payment of million in dividends to preferred shareholders  including million dividends in arrears since the fourth quarter of other we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u 
s 
employees and provide certain post retirement benefits for qualifying retired employees 
as of december   we reviewed our pension assumptions regarding benefit plans based upon current market conditions  current asset mix and our current compensation structure  and reduced our discount rate from to effective january we maintained our assumptions regarding compensation increases at  and our expected rate of return on plan assets at  which represents approximately of our past five year s average annual return rate of 
as of the measurement date for pension obligations september   plan assets totaled million and exceeded the benefit obligation by million 
as a result  we do not expect to make contributions to the plans in for additional information related to our pension plans  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the table below presents our fixed  non cancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily related to our outstanding purchase orders  certain capital expenditures and lease arrangements as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total purchase obligations long term debt contractual obligations operating lease commitments total contractual cash obligations paid in february  including accrued interest of  in september  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement subject to an interest rate of above the london interbank offered rate or an alternate base rate plus 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we were committed to approximately million for various capital projects at the lucky friday and greens creek units 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
we maintain reserves for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our reserves for these matters totaled million  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a wide variety of estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution of the uncertainties increases  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have identified our most critical accounting policies below that are important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters  including by product metals  are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement 
sales from our san sebastian  greens creek and lucky friday units include significant value from by product metals mined along with net values of each unit s primary metal 
due to the time elapsed from the transfer to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the price at which our metals will be sold in reporting our profitability and cash flow 
recorded values are adjusted to month end metals prices until final settlement 
if a significant variance was observed in estimated metals prices or metal content compared to the final actual metals prices or content  our monthly results of operations could be affected 
sales of metals in products tolled  rather than sold to smelters  are recorded at contractual amounts when title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer 
third party smelting  refinery costs and freight expense are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
our sales are based on a provisional sales price containing an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of the sale 
the embedded derivative  which does not qualify for hedge accounting  is adjusted to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement 
changes in the market price of metals significantly affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control  such as political and economic conditions  demand  forward selling by producers  expectations for inflation  central bank sales  custom smelter activities  the relative exchange rate of the us dollar  purchases and lending  investor sentiment  and global mine production levels 
the aggregate effect of these factors is impossible to predict 
because our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
proven and probable ore reserves at least annually  management reviews the reserves used to estimate the quantities and grades of ore at our mines which management believes can be recovered and sold economically 
management s calculations of proven and probable ore reserves are based on in house engineering and geological estimates using current operating costs and metals prices 
periodically  management obtains external audits of reserves 
during the first half of  we obtained third party audits of our reserves at the la camorra unit 
additionally  a partial audit of reserves at greens creek was concluded during the fourth quarter of reserve estimates will change as existing reserves are depleted through production and as production costs and or metals prices change 
a significant drop in metals prices may reduce reserves by making some portion of such ore uneconomic to develop and produce 
changes in reserves may also reflect that actual grades of ore processed may be different from stated reserve grades because of variation in grades in areas mined  mining dilution and other factors 
estimated reserves  particularly for properties that have not yet commenced production  may require revision based on actual production experience 
declines in the market prices of metals  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit or an increase in the dilution of the ore or reduced recovery rates may render ore reserves uneconomic to exploit unless the utilization of forward sales contracts or other hedging techniques are sufficient to offset such effects 
if our realized price for the metals we produce were to decline substantially below the levels set for calculation of reserves for an extended period  there could be material delays in the development of new projects  net losses  reduced cash flow  restatements or reductions in reserves and asset write downs in the applicable accounting periods 
reserves should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of current or future operations 
no assurance can be given that the estimate of the amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
depreciation and depletion the mining industry is extremely capital intensive 
we capitalize property  plant and equipment  and depreciate these items consistent with industry standards 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using straight line and unit of production methods 
depletion is computed using the unit of production method 
as discussed above  our estimates of proven and probable ore reserves may change  possibly in the near term  resulting in changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization rates in future reporting periods 
impairment of long lived assets management reviews the net carrying value of all facilities  including idle facilities  on an annual basis or more frequently if conditions or assumptions materially change that could negatively impact any net carrying value 
we estimate the net realizable value of each property based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows that will be generated from operations at each property  the estimated salvage value of the surface plant and equipment and the value associated with property interests 
these estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are dependent upon the future metals price estimates over the estimated remaining mine life 
if undiscounted cash flows and the asset fair value are less than the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recognized 
management s estimates of metals prices  recoverable ore reserves and operating  capital and reclamation costs are subject to risks and uncertainties of change affecting the recoverability of our investment in various projects 
although management believes it has made a reasonable estimate of these factors based on current conditions and information  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur in the near term which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from our operating properties and the need for asset impairment write downs 
all estimates and assumptions are inherently subjective to some extent and may be impacted by bias  error or changing conventions in the methodology of their determination  or in changing industry conditions 
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the major environmental laws to which we are subject include  among others  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law 
cercla can impose joint and several liability for cleanup and investigation costs  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site  as well as those who generate  or arrange for the disposal of  hazardous substances 
the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the mining industry 
we own or operate properties  or have previously owned and operated property  used for industrial purposes 
use of these properties may subject us to potential material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminants and claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to  or release of  hazardous substances 
at our operating properties  we accrue costs associated with environmental remediation obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record a liability for the present value of our estimated environmental remediation costs and the related asset created with it in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the liability will be accreted and the asset will be depreciated over the life of the related asset 
adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be made 
at our non operating properties  we accrue costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they are reasonably estimable from a range of reasonable estimates in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and aicpa statement of position environmental remediation liabilities 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations have historically been recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study for such facility and are charged to provision for closed operations and environmental matters 
we periodically review our accrued liabilities for costs of remediation as evidence becomes available indicating that our remediation liabilities have potentially changed 
such costs are based on management s then current estimate of amounts expected to be incurred when the remediation work is performed within current laws and regulations 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
future closure  reclamation and environment related expenditures are difficult to estimate in many circumstances due to the early stages of investigation  uncertainties associated with defining the nature and extent of environmental contamination  the uncertainties relating to specific reclamation and remediation methods and costs  application and changing of environmental laws  regulations and interpretations by regulatory authorities and the possible participation of other potentially responsible parties 
reserves for closure costs  reclamation and environmental matters totaled million at december   and we anticipate that the majority of these expenditures relating to these reserves will be made over the next years 
it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost of remediation could change in the future and that changes to these estimates could have a material effect on future operating results as new information becomes known 
for environmental remediation sites known as of december   if the highest estimate from the range based upon information presently available were recorded  the total estimated liability would be increased by approximately million

foreign exchange in venezuela the venezuelan government has fixed the exchange rate of their currency to the us dollar at  bolivares to  which is the exchange rate we utilize to translate the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary included in our consolidated financial statements 
rules and regulations regarding the implementation of exchange controls in venezuela have been published and periodically revised and or updated 
due to the exchange controls in place  the la camorra unit recognized foreign exchange gains  which reduced our cost of sales  capital expenditures and exploration activities by million in  million in and million in  due to the use of multiple exchange rates in valuing us dollar denominated transactions 
as discussed above  the venezuelan government has fixed the exchange rate of the bolivar to the us dollar at  to  however  markets outside of venezuela have reflected a devaluation of the venezuelan currency from such fixed rates 
by product credits cash costs per ounce are consistent with how costs per ounce are calculated within the mining industry 
cash costs per ounce of silver include significant credits from by product metals production  including gold  lead and zinc 
our current view of our proven and probable reserves indicates that our treatment of gold  lead and zinc as by products at the san sebastian  greens creek and lucky friday units continues to be appropriate 
however  management periodically assesses the relationships between metals produced to ensure that presentation of by product credits in our calculation of cash costs per ounce remains appropriate 
cash costs per ounce of silver at the san sebastian unit included significant by product credits from gold production due to strong prices 
while value from by product gold has been significant for san sebastian  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with gold as a by product  was appropriate because we have historically presented san sebastian as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  san sebastian is in a mining district historically identified with silver  exploration has been directed toward silver  and recent exploration results have shown a predominant silver content  and our mining methods and production planning target silver as our primary product  which has been accompanied by a significant gold presence 
strike and shutdown related costs have been excluded from and costs per ounce 
for the year ended december   the total cash cost was per silver ounce  compared to per silver ounce in  and a negative per silver ounce in for the years ended december   and  gold by product credits were approximately   and per silver ounce  respectively 
by product credits at the san sebastian unit are deducted from operating costs in the calculation of cash costs per ounce 
if our accounting policy were changed to treat gold production as a co product  the following total cash costs per ounce would be reported silver gold significant by product credits are also used in calculation of cash costs per ounce of silver at the greens creek and lucky friday units 
for these operations  we view zinc  lead and gold strictly as by products because we have historically presented greens creek and lucky friday  as well as san sebastian  as producers primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  silver represents a higher value that any other metal  silver is the primary object of the cost structures at greens creek and lucky friday  which utilize selective mining methods for recovery of silver rather than bulk methods for recovery of lower value base metals  and by products include two other metals for lucky friday  and three other metals for greens creek 
the values of all by products per ounce of silver produced  net of treatment and freight costs  were greens creek lucky friday cash costs per ounce of silver or gold represent measurements that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations that are not in accordance with gaap 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver or gold produced provide management and investors an indication of net cash flow  after consideration of the realized price received for production sold 
management also uses this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
venezuela value added taxes value added taxes vat are assessed in venezuela on purchases of materials and services 
vat is recorded as an account receivable on our consolidated balance sheet  with a balance of million net of a reserve for anticipated discounts totaling million at december   and million at december  net of a reserve for anticipated discounts of million 
as an exporter from venezuela  we are eligible for refunds from the government for payment of vat  and we prepare a monthly filing to obtain this refund 
refunds are given by the government in the form of tax certificates  which are marketable in venezuela 
we received our most recent certificate from the venezuelan government in march  for all periods through november while we believe that we will receive certificates for all outstanding vat from the venezuelan government  issuance of certificates is slow and the likelihood of recovery at our recorded value may diminish over time 
we have established a reserve of and of face value at december  and  respectively  with reserves established by our analysis of past collections and the likelihood of future collections 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  we have measured compensation cost for stock option plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recording in the financial statements of the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for such award 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   and have selected the modified prospective method 
for all newly granted awards and awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january   the effect on net income loss and earnings per share in the periods following adoption of sfas no 
r are expected to be consistent with our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 as reported in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  except that estimated forfeitures will be considered in the calculation of compensation expense under sfas no 
r 
additionally  the actual effect on net income loss per share will vary depending upon the number and fair value of options granted in future years compared to prior years 
as of december   all of our outstanding stock options were vested and will not impact future year s net income loss under sfas no 
r  with the exception of certain options purchased under our deferred compensation plan 
the expense associated with these options will not be material 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
fin no 
provides clarification of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in paragraph a of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset  and states that an entity shall recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin no 
became effective for us in december  and its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no
