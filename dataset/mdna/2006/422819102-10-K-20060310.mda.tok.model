executive overview our business we are a premier provider of executive search and leadership consulting services 
we help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment  management and deployment of personnel for their executive management and board positions 
in addition to executive search  we provide a range of leadership consulting services  including succession planning  executive development and top team effectiveness 
we provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of consultants located in countries throughout the world 
our executive search services are provided on a retained basis 
revenue before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled 
in addition  if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we often are authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search 
our compensation model our compensation model closely aligns the interests of our consultants  our company and our shareholders 
consultants are rewarded for individual performance based on a system that directly ties compensation to the amount of net revenue for which the consultant is responsible for generating and delivering 
actual compensation is adjusted  up or down  based on our annual performance against company wide and regional profitability targets approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
each quarter  we evaluate the expected annual performance of the consultants  the respective region and the company as a whole 
as annualized performance estimates are revised each quarter  compensation accruals are adjusted in each region 
as a result  the variable portion of compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents in  we adopted a new compensation policy in order to better align consultants interests with those of the shareholders and increase consultant share ownership 
under the new policy  of consultant and management bonuses will be paid in the form of restricted stock units that vest ratably over a three year period from the date of grant 
the restricted stock units will be issued in the month of march following the year in which the bonuses are earned 
compensation expense related to these restricted stock units is recognized over the service period which  for this year  is considered to have begun on january  as bonuses are earned through the final vesting date three years from the date of grant 
as allowed under the new policy  senior management has elected to receive of their bonuses in the form of restricted stock units 
overview in the first quarter of  we consolidated the management teams of our north america and latin america operations and created the position of the president of the americas 
in doing so  we created a new combined americas region 
consistent with this management change  segment information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current segment classifications 
we now operate our executive search and leadership consulting services in three geographic regions the americas  which includes the united states  canada  mexico and latin america  europe  which includes the middle east and africa  and asia pacific 
consistent with the changes in our reportable segments  we announced the promotion of bonnie w 
gwin to president of the americas 
also  in the first quarter of  we announced the promotion of l 
kevin kelly to president of europe 
mr 
kelly also remains in his role as president of asia pacific 
in the first quarter of  we announced that we expected to record restructuring charges beginning in the second quarter of in connection with initiatives to improve operating margin in order to improve our cost structure  principally in europe 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
the charges include severance and other employee related costs of million related to reductions in workforce  primarily in europe  and costs related to the consolidation of office space of million 
included in this net charge was the reversal of million of restructuring accruals  which originated in a prior year  related to a renegotiated sublease for one of our search offices 
in  the search industry continued to show moderate signs of recovery which favorably affected the demand for our services 
the recovery in europe was not as strong as in other regions of the world 
consolidated net revenue increased  or million in  compared to double digit increases were reported in the americas and asia pacific while europe reported an increase of approximately 
all of our industry groups experienced increases in net revenue with the exception of the health care industry group  which experienced a modest decline 
consultant productivity increased as executive search revenue per consultant increased  to million in  compared to million in as a percent of net revenue  salary and employee benefits expense decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses were of net revenue in compared to in we recorded an income tax benefit in of million despite having income before income taxes of million 
the income tax benefit reflects a significant reversal of the us valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
we ended the year with a cash and short term investment balance of million  a decrease of million  compared to million including million of auction rate securities at december  this decrease is primarily the result of the net repurchases of our common stock  a deferred compensation payment  and payments related to the restructuring charges offset by increased cash flows from operations 
the deferred compensation payment was made to our chief executive officer  thomas j 
friel  representing his share of the net proceeds from the september monetization of our google warrants 
see note  significant warrant monetization  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents outlook as we look forward to  we believe that the improved cost structure we established in  as well as the growth initiatives we are currently executing  will allow us to achieve more profitable growth going forward 
we have already begun to strategically invest in hiring and training new consultants and will continue that effort into  with a goal to grow our current consultant base by in in  we also expect further leverage of our fixed costs 
results of operations we operate our executive search and complementary leadership consulting services in three geographic regions the americas  europe  and asia pacific 
for segment purposes  reimbursements of out of pocket expenses classified as revenue are reported separately and therefore are not included in the net revenue by geographic region 
we believe that analyzing trends in revenue before reimbursements net revenue and analyzing operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue more appropriately reflects our core operations

table of contents salaries and employee benefits 
consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  or  to million in from million in fixed salaries and employee benefits increased million and performance related compensation expense increased million 
the increase in fixed salaries and employee benefits expense of million was primarily attributable to a increase in average consultant headcount year over year 
also  fixed stock based compensation expense was higher by million in as compared to primarily as a result of the restricted stock units granted in the first quarter of the net expense related to our german pension plan decreased million in see note  pension plan and life insurance contract  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
performance related compensation expense increased million in compared to primarily as a result of increased net revenue 
we adopted a new compensation policy in whereby of consultant and management bonuses will be paid in the form of restricted stock units that vest ratably over a three year period from the date of grant 
compensation expense related to these restricted stock units is recognized over the service period which  for this year  is considered to have begun on january  as bonuses are earned through the final vesting date three years from the date of grant 
this resulted in a deferral of million of compensation expense from bonus awards as compared to  during which of the annual bonus was being recognized in that fiscal year as it was paid entirely in cash 
excluding a negative impact of million due to exchange rate fluctuations  a comparison which management believes provides a better indication of operational performance  consolidated salaries and employee benefits increased approximately in compared to as a percentage of net revenue  salaries and employee benefits expense was in  compared to in general and administrative expenses 
consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in an increase of million in operating expenses associated with higher net revenue levels and discretionary spending related to marketing and business development activities was offset by certain expenses recorded in that did not recur in among these items are the costs associated with the our worldwide partners meeting that was held in also  we recorded million of legal settlement costs in  of which million was later determined to be covered by our insurance carrier and reimbursed to us in in addition  bad debt expense was million in compared to a net reduction in expense of million in resulting in a net increase of million year over year 
the net reduction in bad debt expense in is related to an adjustment recorded to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on favorable collection experience 
depreciation expense decreased million in along with a decrease of million of other infrastructure costs 
the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on general and administrative expenses was less than one percentage point 
as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in reimbursed expenses 
we incur certain out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by our clients 
historically  we have not established a receivable for reimbursable expenses incurred but not yet billed as the amount was determined to be immaterial 
during the fourth quarter of  we enhanced our estimation technique related to reimbursable expenses resulting in a non recurring favorable impact to operating income of million 
we have accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate 
this change in accounting estimate did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations in future periods 
restructuring charges 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these initiatives focused primarily on europe and included charges of million for severance and other employee related costs related to reductions in workforce and million related to the consolidation of office space 
the 
table of contents workforce reduction affected employees  primarily in europe  and included executive search consultants 
included in the office related charge of million is the reversal of million of restructuring accruals  which originated in a prior year  related to a renegotiated lease for one of our search offices 
by segment  the restructuring charges recorded in are million in the americas  million in europe and million in corporate 
during the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our restructuring accruals and recorded million of restructuring charges to reflect changes in lease estimates primarily due to a tenant default on a sublease and the final determination and payment of certain severance related restructuring accruals 
we expect that cash outlays over the next twelve months related to restructuring charges accrued at december  will be million 
the remaining accrued restructuring charges of million are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms of vacated properties  which extend through operating income 
our consolidated operating income was million in compared to million in the following table summarizes our consolidated operating income for the years ended december  and  respectively operating income loss change in millions total regions corporate operating income before restructuring charges restructuring charges consolidated operating income note totals and subtotals may not equal the sum of individual line items due to rounding 
the decrease in the consolidated operating income was primarily due to improved net revenue and profitability in the geographic regions offset by increased restructuring charges 
in the americas  operating income in increased million to million from million in as net revenue increased by million  salaries and employee benefits expense increased by million 
fixed salaries and employee benefits expense increased by million primarily as a result of higher stock based compensation expense related to restricted stock units granted in the first quarter of performance related compensation expense increased million primarily as a result of increased net revenue 
in addition  we adopted a new compensation policy in whereby of consultant and management bonuses will be paid in the form of restricted stock units that vest ratably over a three year period from the date of grant

compensation expense related to these restricted stock units is recognized over the service period which  for this year  is considered to have begun on january  as bonuses are earned through the final vesting date three years from the date of grant 
this resulted in a million reduction in compensation expense in as compared to  during which of the annual bonus expense was being recognized in that fiscal year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million is a result of higher discretionary spending of million offset by a million of lower infrastructure expenses 
in addition  bad debt expense was million in compared to a net reduction in expense of million in resulting in a net increase of million year over year

net non operating income 
net non operating income was million in  compared to million in interest income in increased million to million primarily due to higher cash balances and higher investment returns on the invested cash

income taxes 
in  we reported income before taxes of million and recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the effective tax benefit rate for  including discrete items was  which is significantly lower than the statutory rate 
the effective tax rate before discrete items of was lower than the statutory rate because the valuation allowance was reduced throughout the year as tax deductions related to deferred tax assets were used to reduce current taxable income  significantly reducing federal and state income tax provision for the current year 
also  the total annual effective tax benefit rate was substantially impacted by additional discrete reversals of portions of the tax valuation allowance established in against net deferred tax assets 
in recent years  we began generating pre tax book income on a consistent basis and expect to continue to do so 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  a company must continually evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and reduce the allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the associated benefits of the deferred tax assets will be utilized 
in  we concluded it was more likely than not that a majority of our us deferred tax assets would be recoverable and  as a result  reversed million of the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
in  as a result of a significant warrant monetization in the third quarter of  we determined that a lesser valuation allowance was required relating to our net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in and recorded a million reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance 

table of contents in  the effective tax rate was  which is significantly lower than the statutory rate  primarily as a result of the partial reduction of the previously recorded valuation allowance relating to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in and the utilization of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards

we receive warrants for equity securities in client companies  in addition to the cash fee  for services rendered on some searches 
some of the warrants meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its subsequent amendments 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
these derivative instruments are initially recorded at their fair value  using the black scholes model  in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding amount recorded as net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
compensation 
table of contents expense related to this net revenue is also recorded 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses  net of the consultants share of the gains losses 
other warrants received and which do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas no 
are initially recorded at their fair value  using the black scholes model  in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding amount recorded as net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
compensation expense related to this net revenue is also recorded 
these warrants are accounted for using the cost method  and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized

any equity securities arising from the exercise of a warrant are accounted for as available for sale investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities

upon the sale of these investments  the company records a realized gain loss  net of the consultants share of the gain loss and other costs 
in  we received warrants to purchase  shares of class b common stock of google at a price of per share issued in connection with recruitment fees 
on august   we exercised the warrants pursuant to their cashless exercise feature and received  shares of google common stock 
in multiple transactions on september  and september   we sold all the shares of common stock of google that we held in ordinary brokerage transactions at an average price of less expenses associated with the transaction resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
during  we recognized realized gains of million  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs  including million related to the monetization of our shares of common stock of google

net other non operating expense was million in compared to million in other non operating expense consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and which are not considered permanent in nature 
income taxes 
in  we had a pre tax loss of million and recorded income tax expense of million 
the income tax provision includes a non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
judgment is required in developing our income tax provision  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
in  and  we reported net losses  primarily due to restructuring activities necessary to align our cost structure with expected net revenue levels 
sfas no 
 accounting for income 
table of contents taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
in considering how the loss was created  evidence indicating that the loss was unusual  infrequent  or an aberration  rather than a continuing condition is an example of positive evidence that might support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence 
until the fourth quarter of  we considered the fact that the cumulative losses were primarily the result of the restructuring charges along with other positive evidence to be sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance was not needed 
however  when we recorded a restructuring charge totaling million in the fourth quarter of  management no longer felt it appropriate  for purposes of sfas no 
 to regard the restructuring charges as unusual  infrequent  or as an aberration  based on the number of restructuring charges recorded from through and the magnitude of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of as a result  the significant negative evidence of cumulative losses in recent years could not be overcome by other positive evidence  most of which was subjective in nature 
based upon the provisions of sfas no 
 we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense recorded in also includes an expense of million  recorded in the first half of  to reduce certain deferred tax assets  representing the excess of expense for accounting purposes over the deduction for tax purposes  required to be recorded upon the vesting of restricted stock units 
in prior years  a portion of executive search consultant and management compensation was granted in restricted stock units at the then average market price of approximately per share 
this price served as the basis for the compensation expense and the related tax benefit and deferred tax asset 
the restricted stock units vested in at an average market price of approximately per share 
as this share price serves as the basis for the current tax deduction  we will realize a smaller tax benefit than initially recorded 
accordingly  we adjusted the deferred tax asset to reflect the lower tax benefit 
at the time we recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets  we anticipated that we would generate a loss for us income tax purposes in  due primarily to the timing of tax deductions related to restructuring charges recorded in prior years  and therefore did not anticipate recording or paying any us federal income tax in these tax estimates excluded the affects of any warrant monetizations due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of such transactions 
as a result of a significant warrant monetization in the third quarter of  we generated income in for us income tax purposes 
accordingly  we determined that a lesser valuation allowance is required related to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in and recorded a million reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance 
in  the effective tax rate was  which is significantly lower than the statutory rate  primarily as a result of the partial reduction of the previously recorded valuation allowance relating to net deferred tax assets associated with tax deductions that will be available for carryback to recover taxes paid in and the utilization of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources general 
we continually evaluate our liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of capital resources based on our operating needs 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with the funds expected to be generated from operations and funds available under our committed line of credit will be sufficient to finance our operations for the foreseeable future  as well as to finance the cash payments associated with our restructuring charges 
we historically have paid a portion of our bonuses in december and the remainder in march 
employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the company s performance and the performance of the individual employee 
our ability to undertake acquisitions may depend  in part  on access to additional funds

in the ordinary course of business  we have at times performed executive search services for certain related parties that are considered immaterial in nature and amount and have been consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arms length transactions 
lines of credit 
in december  we entered into a million committed revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility replaced a million committed revolving credit facility and a million uncommitted credit facility 
under this facility  we may borrow us dollars  euros  sterling and other major traded currencies  as agreed by the banks 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at the existing alternate base rate or libor plus a margin as determined by our compliance with certain tests of financial condition 
the facility has financial tests that we must meet or exceed relating to fixed charge coverage defined as consolidated ebitdar minus consolidated capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rental obligations plus restricted payments 
ebitdar is defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rental expense plus interest income  leverage defined as consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda plus interest income  current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  and net worth 
the facility sets limits on our ability to make acquisitions without bank approval and to incur additional debt outside of the facility 
we must pay a facility fee whether or not the facility is used during the year 
in march  we amended the facility to reduce the net worth covenant from million to million 
this amendment was required as a result of the non cash income tax expense of million  recorded in the fourth quarter of  which provided a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets related to the us and foreign operations which comprise the us income tax entity 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the lines of credit existing at december  or december   nor were there any borrowings during the years ended december  and  respectively  under the then existing lines of credit 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the facility  and no event of default existed 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  a decrease of million  compared to million at december  included in these amounts are million and million of commercial paper at december  and  respectively 

table of contents auction rate securities in the amount of million have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments in the december  consolidated balance sheet to conform to the fiscal presentation 
accordingly  the consolidated statement of cash flows for reflects the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
this change in classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in addition  this change in classification does not affect the financial covenants of the facility

we intend  from time to time and as market conditions warrant  to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated block trades 
no time limit has been set for completion of this program 
through december   we have purchased  shares of our common stock for million under the september authorization 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents our known contractual obligations as of december  and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations payments due for the years ended december  contractual obligations total and and thereafter in millions office space and equipment lease obligations accrued restructuring charges severance asset retirement obligations total see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
see note  restructuring charges  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
represents the fair value of the obligation associated with a retirement of tangible long lived assets  primarily related to our obligation at the end of the lease term to return office space to the landlord in its original condition 
the obligation is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table  we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans 
these liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at december  the obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in note  employee benefit plans  and note  pension plan and life insurance contract 
as the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain  we have not included these obligations in the above table 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from 
table of contents these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue before reimbursements for out of pocket expenses net revenue is recognized when earned and realizable and therefore when the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee to our client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation of the position to be filled 
if actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we are generally authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
net revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance  in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the arrangements 
net revenue in excess of the retainer  resulting from actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeding estimated compensation  is recognized upon completion of the executive search when the amount of the additional fee is known 
our assumptions about the duration of the time and extent of efforts for search teams to complete our services in an executive search engagement require significant judgment as these variables have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
these assumptions are updated annually or whenever conditions exist to indicate that more frequent updates are necessary 
accruals related to the consolidation and closing of offices recorded as part of our restructuring charges 
in  we began the restructuring of our business to better align costs with expected net revenue levels 
these initiatives included the consolidation and closing of offices where we had long term leases 
at the time of the office closings and consolidations  we accrued the estimated costs associated with these actions 
for initiatives which were announced prior to january   the accruals were established in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
for cost reduction initiatives announced after december   the accruals were established in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
inherent in these accruals are estimates concerning vacancy periods  expected sublease income  and costs to terminate the leases 
these accruals are periodically updated to reflect information concerning the commercial real estate markets in which the offices are located 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges to increase accruals for leased properties that had been identified as excess in previous office consolidation charges 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges to reflect changes in lease estimates primarily due to a tenant default on a sublease and the final determination and payment of certain severance related restructuring accruals 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  which include million for severance and other employee related costs related to reductions in workforce and million related to the consolidation of office space 
included in the office related charge of million is the reversal of million of restructuring accruals  which originated in a prior year  related to a renegotiated lease for one of our search offices 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to accruals for the consolidation and closing of offices is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to changes in the commercial real estate markets and the local regional economic factors where this leased office space is located 

table of contents income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in our us and foreign operations during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
while we expect to be profitable in and beyond  there is no assurance that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to our income tax provision  deferred tax assets and liabilities and income taxes payable and recoverable is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to our ability to generate taxable income in our us and foreign operations in future years and to adequately provide for potential income tax related liabilities 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill of the reporting unit would be considered impaired 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill shall be determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units was determined using a combination of valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company methodology  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the discounted cash flow approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities  and other variables to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
these assumptions are updated annually  at a minimum  to reflect information concerning our reportable segments 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  is recognized 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable from our customers are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable balances 
we determine the allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts through an analysis of several factors  including the aging of our accounts receivable  historical write off experience  and specific account analyses 
we consider current and projected economic conditions and historical trends when determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from our estimates due to changes in future economic or industry conditions or specific customers financial condition 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement requires that the costs of all employee share based payments be measured at fair value on the award s grant date and be recognized in the financial statements over the requisite service period 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
and its related interpretations  and eliminates the alternative use of the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb no 
 which the company is currently using 
under sfas no 
r  we have the option of adopting the new requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  however this method also allows us to restate prior period financial statements based on the pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method as of january   the required effective date for calendar year companies 
additionally  the new standard requires companies to measure the fair value of its options using either a black scholes option pricing model or a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based on our evaluation of acceptable models available to value its options as well as the type and number of stock options we anticipate granting in the future  we have elected to continue using the black scholes model to value our options 
sfas no 
r requires companies who previously had a policy of recognizing the effects of forfeitures associated stock based awards as they occurred to begin estimating forfeitures as awards are granted and make adjustments to those estimates based on actual results 
we will begin estimating forfeitures for all new awards granted after adoption of sfas no 
r 
additionally  we previously did not estimate forfeitures for our stock based awards 
we will be required to make an estimate of forfeitures for any previously granted unvested awards in which we recognized compensation expense prior to adoption of sfas no 
r and in  will record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which is not expected to be material 
sfas no 
r includes several modifications to the way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements 
additionally  sfas no 
r requires companies to report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as a financing cash flow instead of an operating cash flow as required under the current accounting literature 
this requirement will result in a reduction of net operating cash flows and an increase in net financing cash flows in periods subsequent to the our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the impact on our future cash flows cannot be estimated since it is dependent upon when employees exercise their options 
under sfas no 
r  we will elect to recognize compensation expense for all share based awards with service periods beginning subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   will have a material effect on our financial statements  primarily from the inclusion of stock option expense not required to be recognized under previous accounting literature  resulting in a reduction of net earnings of approximately million 
see note  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for additional information regarding the company s stock based compensation plans 

table of contents in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
which expressed the views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations

provides guidance related to the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies  including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term 
we will incorporate the additional guidance included in sab no 
in conjunction with our adoption of sfas no

in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement requires voluntary changes in accounting principles to be recorded retrospectively for prior periods rather than a cumulative adjustment in the current period 
this same treatment is required for new accounting pronouncements that do not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
does not change the apb opinion guidance of accounting for changes in estimates in the current period and the accounting for errors as restatements of prior periods 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
beginning january   the required effective date

during the first quarter of  we announced that we would record restructuring charges beginning in the second quarter of in connection with initiatives to improve operating margin in order to meet company wide profitability objectives 
certain of the costs associated with the restructuring initiatives that began in the second quarter of were recognized in subsequent periods when liabilities were incurred  in accordance with sfas no 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a realized gain of million  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs  including million related to the monetization of our shares of common stock of google 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
we receive warrants for equity securities in our client companies  in addition to our cash fee  for services rendered on some searches 
some of the warrants meet the definition of a derivative instrument under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its subsequent amendments 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
these derivative instruments are initially recorded at their fair value using a black scholes model  in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding amount recorded as net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
bonus expense related to this net revenue is also recorded 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses  net of the consultants share of the gains losses 
upon a value event such as an initial public offering or an acquisition  the warrants are monetized  resulting in a realized gain  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs 
in  and  we recorded realized gains  net of the consultants share of the gain and other costs  of million  million  million  respectively  related to the equity and warrant portfolio 
currency market risk 
with our operations primarily in the americas  europe and asia pacific we conduct business using various currencies 
revenue earned in each country is generally matched with the associated expenses incurred  thereby reducing currency risk to earnings 
however  because certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  changes in currency rates may cause fluctuations in the valuation of such assets and liabilities 
as the local currency of our subsidiaries has been designated as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currency financial statements into us dollars 
outside of the americas  europe is our largest region in terms of net revenue 
a change in the average exchange rate of the british pound and the euro would have increased or decreased our net income less than million
