overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
plan of liquidation on may   the company s board approved the plan and on november   the company s stockholders adopted the plan 
the plan contemplates the orderly sale of each of the company s remaining assets  which are either owned directly or through the company s joint ventures  the collection of all outstanding loans from third parties  the orderly disposition or completion of construction of development properties  the discharge of all outstanding liabilities to third parties and  after the establishment of appropriate reserves  the distribution of all remaining cash to stockholders 
the company currently contemplates that approximately months after the approval of the plan any remaining assets and liabilities would be transferred into a liquidating trust 
the liquidating trust would continue in existence until all liabilities have been settled  all remaining assets have been sold and proceeds distributed and the appropriate statutory periods have lapsed 
after the approval of the plan by the stockholders  the company completed the sale of its largest asset  the three residential rental phases of its palomino park project for  on december   the company made the initial liquidating distribution of per share  aggregating approximately  to its stockholders 
for all periods preceding stockholder approval of the plan on november   the company s financial statements are presented on the going concern basis of accounting 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  the company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting as of the close of business on november  under the liquidation basis of accounting  assets are stated at their estimated net realizable value and liabilities are stated at their estimated settlement amounts  which estimates will be periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate 
the following paragraphs summarize certain of the material actions and events which have occurred regarding the plan and certain decisions of the board 
in march  the company reported that the board authorized and retained the financial advisory firm  lazard ltd  to advise the company on various strategic financial and business alternatives available to it to maximize stockholder value 
such alternatives included a recapitalization  acquisitions  disposition of assets  liquidation  the sale or merger of the company and other alternatives that would keep the company independent 
on may   after consideration of the alternatives available  the company announced that its board approved the plan 
in march  the board authorized the marketing of the three residential rental phases of palomino park 
in the second quarter of  the company engaged a broker to market these phases 
in august  the company entered into an agreement to sell these phases for  subject to  among other things  stockholder approval of the plan 
the sale closed on november the following transactions  which are consistent with the intent of the plan  occurred prior to the november  adoption of the plan by the stockholders i in september  the company s interest in its wellsford whitehall joint venture was redeemed for approximately  ii by may  the company retired  of tax exempt bond financing  iii in april  the company redeemed its outstanding  of debentures and iv in november  the company received  for its interest in second holding 
on october   the board met to review with management the cash distributions which the company expected stockholders to receive in connection with the plan in view of the recent redemption of the company s interest in wellsford whitehall  the impending sale of the three residential rental phases of palomino park and the recent decision for the company to continue to incur the costs of operating as a public company through the liquidation period 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the board determined to increase by per share  the range for the aggregate cash distributions it expects stockholders will receive as a result of the plan from the previously announced range of to per share to and per share 
the board also estimated that the initial liquidating distribution would be per share  which was at the high end of the previously estimated range of and per share 
the initial liquidating distribution of per share was made on december  to stockholders of record on december  at december   the company reported in the accompanying financial statements that its net assets in liquidation aggregated  or per share based upon  common shares outstanding at december  this amount presents development projects at estimated net realizable value after giving effect to the discounting of estimated net proceeds therefrom 
all other assets are presented at estimated net realizable value on an undiscounted basis 
the amount also includes a reserve for future estimated general and administrative expenses and other costs during the liquidation 
estimated net realizable value reflects economic changes and various other changed circumstances over recent months 
there can be no assurance that these estimated values will be realized 
such amount should not be taken as an indication of the timing or amount of future distributions to be made by the company see the liquidation basis of accounting disclosure below 
the timing and amount of interim liquidating distributions if any and final liquidating distributions will depend on the timing and amount of proceeds the company will receive upon the sale of the remaining assets and the extent to which reserves for current or future liabilities are required 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that there will be any liquidating distributions prior to a final liquidating distribution 
selected significant accounting policies management has selected the following accounting policies which it believes are significant in understanding the company s activities  financial position and operating results 
basis of presentation liquidation basis of accounting with the approval of the plan by the stockholders  the company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting effective as of the close of business on november  under the liquidation basis of accounting  assets are stated at their estimated net realizable value and liabilities are stated at their estimated settlement amounts  which estimates will be periodically reviewed and adjusted as appropriate 
a statement of net assets in liquidation and a statement of changes in net assets in liquidation are the principal financial statements presented under the liquidation basis of accounting 
the valuation of assets at their net realizable value and liabilities at their anticipated settlement amounts represent estimates  based on present facts and circumstances  of the net realizable values of assets and the costs associated with carrying out the plan and dissolution based on the assumptions set forth below 
the actual values and costs associated with carrying out the plan are expected to differ from the amounts shown herein because of the inherent uncertainty and will be greater than or less than the amounts recorded 
such differences may be material 
in particular  the estimates of the company s costs will vary with the length of time it operates 
in addition  the estimate of net assets in liquidation in the accompanying statement of net assets in liquidation  which except for projects under development  does not incorporate a present value discount 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the aggregate amount or timing of future distributions to stockholders and no assurance can be given that the amount of liquidating distributions to be received will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets in liquidation presented in the accompanying statement of net assets in liquidation or the price or prices at which the company s common stock has traded or is expected to trade in the future 
valuation assumptions under the liquidation basis of accounting  the carrying amounts of assets as of the date of the adoption of the plan november  were adjusted to their estimated net realizable values and liabilities including the estimated costs associated with implementing the plan were adjusted to estimated settlement amounts 
the following are the significant assumptions utilized by management in assessing the value of assets and the expected settlement values of liabilities included in the statement of net assets in liquidation at november  and december  net assets in liquidation real estate assets under development are primarily reflected at net realizable value which is based upon the company s budgets for constructing and selling out the respective project in the orderly course of business 
sales prices are based upon contracts signed to date and budgeted sales prices for the unsold units or homes 
sales prices have been determined in consultation with the respective third party company who is the sales agent for the project  where applicable 
costs and expenses are based upon the company s budgets which have been reviewed with the third party construction company or joint venture partner 
in certain cases  construction costs are subject to binding contracts 
the company has assumed that existing construction financing will remain in place during the respective projects planned construction and sell out 
anticipated future cost increases for construction are assumed to be funded by the existing construction lenders and the company at the present structured debt to equity capitalization ratios in which event the company will make additional equity contributions 
for one project  the company has assumed that a construction loan will be obtained at currently existing libor spreads and customary industry debt to equity capitalization levels 
the expected net sales proceeds have been discounted on a quarterly basis at to annual rates to determine the estimated net realizable value of the company s equity investment 
the east lyme land parcel acquired in november is stated at cost which is the current estimated net realizable value 
the reis valuation amount is based upon offers reis is currently considering from potential purchasers as of march  see forward looking statements and risk factors for additional disclosure regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding reis and the possible sale of that company 
assets of the deferred compensation plan are included in restricted cash and investments and primarily stated at their respective market values and are equal to the related deferred compensation liability 
the beekman assets are presented at the company s aggregate cost which equals its net realizable value 
on january   a company which is owned by messrs 
lynford and lowenthal  the principal of the company s joint venture partner in the east lyme project and others acquired the beekman project for an amount equal to costs and expenses incurred by the company 
cash  deposits and escrow accounts are presented at face value 
the company s remaining assets  that the company has determined to have a cash value  are stated at estimated net realizable value which is the expected selling price or contractual payment to be received  less applicable direct costs or expenses  if any 
the assets that have been valued on this basis include receivables  joint venture investments and other investments 
all assets  other than as described above  were assigned no value at november  and december  mortgage notes and construction loans payable  construction payables and accrued expenses and other liabilities are stated at settlement amounts 
reserve for estimated costs during the liquidation period under the liquidation basis of accounting  the company is required to estimate and accrue the costs associated with implementing and completing the plan 
these amounts can vary significantly due to  among other things  the timing and realized proceeds from sales of the projects under development and the sale of reis to a third party  the costs of retaining personnel and others to oversee the liquidation  including the cost of insurance  the timing and amounts associated with discharging known and contingent liabilities and the costs associated with cessation of the company s operations including an estimate of costs subsequent to that date which would include reserve contingencies for the appropriate statutory periods 
as a result  the company has accrued the projected costs  including corporate overhead and specific liquidation costs of severance and retention bonuses  professional fees  and other miscellaneous wind down costs  expected to be incurred during the projected period required to complete the liquidation of the company s remaining assets 
also  the company has not recorded any liability for any cash operating shortfall that may result at the projects under construction during the anticipated holding period because management currently expects that projected operating shortfalls could be funded from the operating profits overall from the sale of homes and condominium units and interest earned on invested cash 
these projections could change materially based on the timing of any such anticipated sales  the performance of the underlying assets and changes in the underlying assumptions of the cash flow amounts projected 
these accruals will be adjusted from time to time as projections and assumptions change 
the following is a summary of the changes in the reserve for estimated costs during the liquidation period november  transfers and payments december  payroll  benefits  severance and retention costs    professional fees    other general and administrative costs   total    going concern basis of accounting for all periods preceding the approval of the plan on november   the company s financial statements are presented on the going concern basis of accounting 
such financial statements reflect the historical basis of the assets and liabilities as of december  and the historical results of operations related to the company s assets and liabilities for the period from january  to november  and the years ended december  and  as well as all preceding years 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and include the assets and liabilities contributed to and assumed by the company from the trust  from the time such assets and liabilities were acquired or incurred  respectively  by the trust 
investments in entities where the company does not have a controlling interest were accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
these investments were initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investment s income loss and additional contributions or distributions through the adoption of the liquidation basis of accounting 
investments in entities where the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions among the company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
variable interests during  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities 
the company evaluates its investments and subsidiaries to determine if an entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under the provisions of finr 
an entity is a vie when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity from financing its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity holders either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity or investment is deemed to be a vie  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie or receives a majority of the residual returns is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
the following table and footnotes identify the company s vies vie at december  requires entity a consolidation wrp convertible trust i n a yes no b non qualified deferred compensation trust yes yes yes c reis yes yes no d second holding n a e no f wellsford mantua yes yes yes g claverack yes yes yes h beekman yes yes no i a for additional information regarding these entities  see footnotes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
b the entity that issued the convertible trust preferred securities is a vie  however  it is not appropriate to consolidate this entity under the provisions of finr as equity interests are variable interests only to the extent that the investment is considered to be at risk 
since the company s investment was funded by wrp convertible trust i  it is not considered to be at risk 
accordingly  the company de consolidated the entity during the first quarter of the entity ceased operations when the convertible trust preferred securities were redeemed in april c the non qualified deferred compensation trust rabbi trust or deferred compensation plan is a vie as it does not have its own equity 
the company is the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trust as the assets would be subject to attachment in a bankruptcy 
the company consolidated the assets and liabilities of the rabbi trust at december  and  as well as for periods prior to the issuance of finr as appropriate under other existing accounting literature 
d reis is a vie because as of the last capital event for that entity in the triggering event for vie evaluation purposes  it was determined that reis did not have sufficient capital to support its business activities at that time 
consolidation of reis is not required by the company as it would not be the primary beneficiary 
e the company sold its investment in second holding in november f second holding was a vie at december   however  the company was not the primary beneficiary because it would not expect that it would absorb a majority of second holding s probability weighted expected losses  nor would it ever receive a majority of the residual returns 
therefore  consolidation was not required under finr nor was consolidation appropriate under then existing accounting literature 
the company used the equity method of accounting to account for this investment 
g wellsford mantua is a vie as the venture does not have sufficient equity to support its operations as the company provides of the financing to this entity and the owners have deminimus equity in the entity 
the company is the primary beneficiary and consolidates this entity 
h claverack  an entity in which the company owns a interest in equity and profits except if returns exceed per annum as defined is considered a vie  since the original capital is insufficient to support its contemplated activities 
claverack is consolidated  even though the two members share business decisions equally  since the company would be the primary beneficiary of profits or absorber of losses 
at december   claverack had  of restricted cash and was subject to  of construction debt which was jointly guaranteed by the company and the principal of its joint venture partner 
i beekman is a vie  however  since the company s investment was a mortgage interest  the company has no gaap equity in the entity and would not be the primary bearer of losses  consolidation is not appropriate 
real estate  other investments  depreciation  amortization and impairment costs directly related to the acquisition  development and improvement of real estate are capitalized  including interest and other costs incurred during the construction period 
costs incurred for significant repairs and maintenance that extend the usable life of the asset or have a determinable useful life are capitalized 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
the company expensed all lease turnover costs for its residential units such as painting  cleaning  carpet replacement and other turnover costs as such costs were incurred 
depreciation was computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straight line basis  principally years for residential buildings and improvements and two to twelve years for furnishings and equipment 
the company has historically reviewed its real estate assets  investments in joint ventures and other investments for impairment i whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable for assets held for use and ii when a determination is made to sell an asset or investment 
under the liquidation basis of accounting  the company will evaluate the fair value of real estate assets owned and under construction and make adjustments to the carrying amounts when appropriate 
revenue recognition commercial properties were leased under operating leases 
rental revenue from office properties was recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
residential units were leased under operating leases with typical terms of six to fourteen months and such rental revenue was recognized monthly as tenants were billed 
interest revenue is recorded on an accrual basis 
fee revenues were recorded in the period earned  based upon formulas as defined by agreement for management services or upon asset sales and purchases by certain joint venture investments 
sales of real estate assets  including condominium units and single family homes  and investments are recognized at closing subject to receipt of down payments and other requirements in accordance with applicable accounting guidelines 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting  including the liquidation basis of accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances with respect to deferred income tax assets are recorded when deemed appropriate and adjusted based upon periodic evaluations 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
changes in net assets and results of operations changes in net assets in liquidation from november  to december  during the period from november  through december   the company realized operating income of  which primarily represents interest income earned from cash and cash equivalents offset in part by operating costs of properties under development

the loss in the period is primarily attributable to i a  impairment charge recorded by the company at september  related to the sale of its interest in second holding  ii the company s net  share of a write down of one of second holding s investments during the first quarter of and iii the company s share of losses aggregating  from wellsford whitehall  including impairment provisions recorded at december  related primarily to classifying assets as held for sale and writing down the assets to expected selling prices  less closing costs  and losses from operations  net of net gains from asset disposition transactions 
as described above  the company sold its largest asset on november  and thereby ceased all rental operations  eliminating all rental income and property operating expenses  management  real estate taxes  depreciation and certain other costs for these assets 
in addition  as described above  the liquidation basis of accounting requires the company to establish a liability for all costs expected to be incurred in executing the plan 
accordingly  effective november   all subsequent general and administrative costs incurred are charged against this liability 
other than as described below  the palomino park sale and the adoption of the liquidation basis of accounting accounts for the differences between the period and the period

fee revenue decreased  the decrease is primarily attributable to fees earned from second holding in of  with no equivalent as this investment was sold in november this decrease was partially offset by an increase of  in asset disposition fees payable by whitehall derived from wellsford whitehall sales as such fees were  during  as compared to fees of  earned in the period 
as a result of the redemption of the company s interest in wellsford whitehall  fee revenue will no longer be earned by the company 
depreciation expense decreased  this decrease primarily relates to the impact of a full year s worth of depreciation expense on the palomino park assets in  as well as the amortization related to the clairborne fordham venture recorded in the period  and the write off of unamortized second holding costs in november as a result of the sale of that investment  with no equivalent expense 
interest expense for mortgages decreased  the decrease is primarily attributable to net capitalized interest of  in as compared to  in as the period includes interest capitalization on projects with construction financing and on the company s invested capital as capitalization on these projects commenced in the later part of in addition  the outstanding principal balances with respect to the palomino park phases amortizing loans were retired upon the sale of these assets in november  as well as the  of palomino park bonds during 
interest expense for debentures decreased  as a result of the redemption in april  offset in part by a write off of the related balance of the unamortized deferred debt costs in excess of normal amortization 
general and administrative expenses increased  based upon prorated expenses  primarily due to increases in salaries and incentive payments based upon contractual obligations  increases in accruals for legal and accounting based upon higher costs in these categories and transaction costs in excess of amounts to accomplish the plan

the loss is primarily attributable to an impairment provision by the wellsford whitehall venture and related charges during the fourth quarter of annually  after the preparation of budgets for the following year and as part of the financial statement closing process  wellsford whitehall performs evaluations for impairment on all of its real estate assets 
as part of the fiscal evaluation  wellsford whitehall recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to assets in the portfolio during the fourth quarter of the provision was not the result of a change in the intended use of such assets 
however  it was the result of several factors including  but not limited to  a continued deterioration of and outlook for the suburban office submarkets where wellsford whitehall s properties are situated 
specifically  these included decreasing market rents  slower absorption trends and greater tenant concession costs 
the company s share of this impairment charge was approximately  in additionally  as a result of the wellsford whitehall charge  the company wrote off the balance of unamortized warrant costs of  related to wellsford whitehall and determined at that time that it was not appropriate to carry the balance of the net deferred tax asset attributable to nol carryforwards and recorded a valuation allowance of  in the fourth quarter of rental revenue decreased  this decrease is due to the impact of rent concessions in excess of the period at all phases of palomino park  and the gradual elimination of rental operations at the silver mesa phase resulting from unit sales and all units being classified as sales inventory by december   whereas more units were being rented during the period as compared to the period  offset by increased average physical occupancy of for from for at the blue ridge  red canyon and green river phases at palomino park revenues from sales of residential units and the associated cost of sales from such units were  and  respectively  from silver mesa unit sales during and were  and  respectively  from sales during the corresponding period

fee revenue decreased  asset disposition fees payable by whitehall derived from wellsford whitehall sales amounted to  during  as compared to fees of  earned in the period 
the company s management fees for its role in the second holding investment decreased  for the period from the period 
fee revenue during the current period was impacted by changes in the amount of assets under management by second holding as a result of the decision not to purchase any new assets and allow the run off of existing investments and by the sale of the company s interest in the venture in november property operating and maintenance expense decreased  this decrease is primarily the result of a decline in operating expenses for the silver mesa phase from continuing unit sales during and of  see sales discussion above  offset by the effect of net increases for property operating and maintenance expenses at the other phases of palomino park of  including increases in replacements  advertising  payroll and utility costs  offset by decreases in certain maintenance cost categories and period costs in for the consolidated development projects of the decrease in real estate taxes of  is primarily attributable to reduced taxes from fewer silver mesa units from continuing sales  and reduced taxes on the gold peak land from a lower assessment and the commencement in september of capitalizing taxes to the project basis during development 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  this decrease is primarily attributable to the company expensing  of unamortized warrant costs in  including the remaining unamortized balance of  which was written off at december  in connection with the impairment charge recorded by wellsford whitehall with no comparable expense in the period 
the decrease is additionally impacted by no depreciation expense recorded on the silver mesa units as all of the units were transferred from operations to residential units available for sale during  offset by additional amortization related to the clairborne fordham venture recorded during  and the write off of unamortized second holding basis differences of  upon the sale of the company s investment in november aggregate interest expense increased  this increase is attributable to interest expense and deferred cost amortization on  of debentures during the period  as a result of the adoption of finr and the de consolidation of the convertible trust preferred securities  as previously described  whereas such expense was treated as a distribution in the period 
the increase is also attributable to the green river phase as the period includes interest for the entire period at a higher fixed rate on a larger average outstanding balance on the permanent financing  whereas during the period  there was a lower variable interest rate on a lower amount of construction financing until the permanent financing was in place in february 
in addition  the period had a higher average base interest rate on the palomino park bonds as compared to the period  due to rising interest rates during these increases were offset by lower average outstanding principal balances with respect to the other palomino park phases loans  and capitalized interest of  in with only  capitalized in the period

the amount also includes reserving all of the assets where the tax basis is greater than the liquidation value and a portion of the reserve for estimated liquidation costs 
the amount also includes reserving the differences in the basis of the company s investment in wellsford whitehall 
as a result of the significant tax gain on the sale of the company s palomino park rental project together with the realization for tax purposes of almost all of the wellsford whitehall tax basis differences and the utilization of a portion of available nols to offset the palomino park gain  the company was able to reduce the valuation allowance from the amount

ownership changes set forth in section may have occurred during any limitation on the utilization of nols may be mitigated as a result of recognizing any net unrealized built in gains that existed at ownerhip change dates

the continuing increases in energy costs  construction materials such as concrete  lumber and sheetrock and interest rates could adversely impact our home building businesses 
as these costs increase  our product becomes more expensive to build and profit margins could deteriorate 
in order to maintain profit margin levels  we may need to increase sale prices of our condominiums and homes 
the continuing rise in energy costs and interest rates may negatively impact our marketing efforts and the ability for buyers to afford our homes at any price level  which could result in the inability to meet targeted sales prices or cause sale price reductions
