overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new therapeutics for the treatment of short stature and other endocrine disorders 
our first commercial product is increlex  a dna derived recombinant human insulin like growth factor  or rhigf we obtained approval of long term increlex replacement therapy for severe primary insulin like growth factor deficiency  or severe primary igfd  from the fda in august  and increlex was granted seven years of orphan drug marketing exclusivity for the long term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary igfd 
see the section entitled risks related to our business under item a above for further details related to our orphan drug marketing exclusivity 
in january  we launched increlex in the united states 
we also submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  to the european medicines agency  or emea  for approval to market increlex in the european union for the long term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary igfd or with growth hormone gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to growth hormone  or gh 
we licensed the rights of genentech  inc to develop  manufacture and commercialize rhigf products for a broad range of indications  including short stature  worldwide 
our current focus is on marketing and selling increlex for the treatment for severe primary igfd  and developing increlex as a replacement therapy for primary igf deficiency  or primary igfd 
we define the indication primary igfd to mean a child who has a height standard deviation score  or height sds  and an igf standard deviation score  or igf sds  of less than minus two  and the indication severe primary igfd to mean a child who has a height sds and igf sds of minus three or less  in each case in the presence of normal or elevated levels of growth hormone 
we are developing increlex for use in the broad population of children with primary igfd 
we are currently conducting two late stage clinical trials for the use of rhigf in primary igfd 
we are assessing our increlex development strategy for other indications 
tercica  inc s predecessor  tercica limited  a new zealand company  was formed in october tercica medica  inc was incorporated in delaware in december  adopted the calendar year as its fiscal year and subsequently changed its name to tercica  inc in early  tercica  inc 
acquired at amounts approximating tercica limited s historical net book value an immaterial amount of assets  including intellectual property rights  from tercica limited as its operations were moved from new zealand to california 
in march  tercica limited made a final  immaterial distribution to its stockholders in connection with its legal liquidation 

table of contents in april  we licensed from genentech intellectual property to develop and commercialize rhigf for a broad range of indications  including short stature and diabetes in the united states 
in december  we entered into a development and commercial supply contract for the manufacture of bulk rhigf drug substance with cambrex bio science baltimore  inc  or cambrex baltimore 
in july  we signed an international license and collaboration agreement with genentech obtaining its rights to develop and commercialize rhigf products outside of the united states for all indications other than diseases and conditions of the central nervous system 
in addition  we must enter into a written agreement with another company if we desire to commercialize increlex for the treatment of diabetes outside of the united states 
in january  we entered into a loan agreement with venture leasing lending iv  inc  or vll  under which we had the option to draw down funds in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
this facility expired on december  with no borrowings from this facility 
in october  we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge  which entitles us to sell and obligates kingsbridge to purchase a maximum of approximately million newly issued shares of our common stock over a three year period for cash up to an aggregate of million  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
see the discussion below under committed equity financing facility for further details on the ceff 
as of december   we had not issued any shares under this facility 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have funded our operations since inception through the private placement of equity securities and public offerings of our common stock 
in  we raised million through the sale of shares of our series a preferred stock 
in  we raised million through the sale of shares of our series b preferred stock 
on march   we completed our initial public offering of common stock in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million and received an additional million of net cash proceeds on april  in connection with the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional shares 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering of common stock in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million 
on january   we completed another follow on public offering of common stock in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million 
revenues we began generating revenue from the sale of our current product  increlex  in january research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with manufacturing development activities and clinical and regulatory activities 
manufacturing development activities include pre fda approval preparation activities for current good manufacturing practices cgmp  regulatory inspection preparation  technology transfer  process development and validation  quality control and assurance activities  analytical services  personnel and related benefits and depreciation 
clinical and regulatory activities include the preparation  implementation  management of our clinical trials and assay development  as well as regulatory compliance  data management and biostatistics 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on manufacturing development activities at our contract manufacturers  including clinical supplies manufacturing  manufacturing process development  validation and qualification activities  analytical development  and compliance related support  inspection preparation and clinical and regulatory development activities related to severe primary igfd and primary igfd 
prior to receiving regulatory approval  we charged all drug supply production costs to research and development 
some of these drug supply costs incurred subsequent to august are included in inventory as our product received regulatory approval that month  and the subsequent cost of sales of these inventories may not be indicative of future costs of sales 
because we licensed non clinical  clinical and manufacturing data and know how related to rhigf from genentech in  we did not incur 
table of contents significant development expenses prior to during  our research and development activities were primarily focused on two projects the transfer of our rhigf manufacturing process and the development project for primary igfd 
at the end of  we began to manage the development project for severe primary igfd as a separate project from the development project for primary igfd and completed the technology transfer of our manufacturing process to our contract manufacturers 
our primary focus in research and development in was associated with the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers and preparations for the anticipated nda filing for severe primary igfd 
during  our research and development activities primarily centered around our nda filing  process validation  quality control and assurance  and analytical services in preparations for fda inspections at our contract manufacturers and development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd 
development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd consists primarily of clinical and regulatory activities  including costs associated with clinical trials 
the fda approved our nda in august and granted increlex seven years of orphan drug marketing exclusivity for the long term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary igfd 
we expect to be primarily focused on clinical activities in primary igfd 
our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel  executive management  corporate administration  legal fees  pre launch commercial planning activities  facility costs  insurance  information technology and accounting services 
during  we continued to expand our corporate staffing and infrastructure and initiated planning for sales and marketing activities 
during  we expanded our corporate staffing and infrastructure  increased our pre launch activities and implemented section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect total selling  general and administrative expenses in to increase primarily due to commercial activities associated with marketing increlex for severe primary igfd  partially offset by decreased legal costs associated with our litigation with insmed incorporated and avecia limited 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows stock compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
 and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb no 
the 
table of contents information regarding net loss as required by sfas no 
has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of that statement 
stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option grants at exercise prices below the reassessed fair value of the underlying common stock resulting in our recording stock compensation associated with these grants 
stock compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
from inception through january   we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
at december   we had a total of million of deferred stock compensation remaining to be amortized over the vesting period of the stock options of approximately two years 
in the year ended december   we reversed million of deferred stock compensation due to the forfeiture of unvested stock options from employee terminations 
we have not recorded any additional deferred stock compensation subsequent to january  the total unamortized deferred stock compensation recorded for all option grants through january   net of the amounts reversed associated with forfeited stock options will be amortized as follows million for the year ending december  and million for the year ending december  on december   the fasb issued an amendment to sfas no 
 share based payment  sfas no 
r 
we have adopted sfas no 
r as of january  sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
companies are required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to be used for valuing share based payments and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards 
we have also selected the modified prospective transition method  whereby compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of sfas no 
r beginning with the effective date a for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we believe that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our results of operations 
we expect to continue to grant stock based compensation to employees 
our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  the number of stock based awards our board of directors may grant in the future  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of inventories for increlex  which was approved by the fda in august cost is determined using the first in  first out basis 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demands for our products  however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  inventory write downs may be required that could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations 
clinical trial expenses we contract with third party clinical research organizations to perform various clinical trial activities 
we recognize research and development expenses for these contracted activities based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other 
table of contents activity based factors 
we match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers  we record prepaid expenses and accruals relating to clinical trials based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events as specified in each clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjust estimates accordingly 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development relates to in licensed technology  intellectual property and know how 
the nature of the efforts for completion of research and development activities surrounding rhigf generally include completion of clinical trials  completion of manufacturing validation  interpretation of clinical and preclinical data and obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other foreign regulatory bodies  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to determine 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with timely completion of development projects  including clinical trial results  manufacturing process development results  and ongoing feedback from regulatory authorities  including obtaining marketing approval 
in addition  products under development may never be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals  the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting  changes in the reimbursement environment  or the introduction of new competitive products 
as a result of the uncertainties noted above  we charge in licensed intellectual property and licenses for unapproved products to acquired in process research and development 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
we did not generate any revenues from increlex for the years ended december  and we began generating revenue from the sale of increlex in january research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the million in expenses for the year ended december  were comprised primarily of personnel and related costs of million  costs associated with the process validation  quality control and assurance  analytical services and preparations for pre approval inspections at our contract manufacturers totaling million  costs related to our development projects for primary igfd and severe primary igfd  which consists primarily of costs associated with the implementation and management of our clinical trials totaling million and a milestone payment of million to genentech upon receiving fda approval of increlex 
in the year ended december   total research and development expenses decreased by million over the same period in this decrease was primarily due to lower costs related to manufacturing activities  which decreased by million from the same period in manufacturing development expenses in included establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers and cgmp preparations for the anticipated nda filing in severe primary igfd  neither of which were required in costs in associated with our development projects for primary igfd and severe primary igfd decreased by million due primarily to the timing of certain start up clinical trial expenses incurred in these decreases were partially offset by higher personnel costs of million and a milestone payment to genentech of million 
we expect to be primarily focused on clinical activities in primary igfd 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the million increase was attributable to increased legal fees primarily associated with our litigation with insmed and avecia of million  increased personnel costs of million and increased corporate administration expenses including consulting  professional fees  insurance  facilities and other expenses of million 
we 
table of contents expect total selling  general and administrative expenses in to increase primarily due to increased personnel and commercial activities associated with marketing increlex for severe primary igfd  partially offset by decreased legal costs associated with our litigation with insmed and avecia 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development expense was million in the year ended december  we did not incur acquired in process research and development expenses in the same period in the costs in resulted from a million payment to genentech related to the exclusive license to genentech s worldwide rights  including the united states  to igf combined with igfbp for all indications  other than diseases and conditions of the central nervous system  and  of costs resulting from the execution of a patent license 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  we did not incur any interest expense in the comparable period in interest expense in represented the value of  shares of common stock we issued in in connection with our loan agreement with vll of million and  of commitment fees related to our loan agreement with vll 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to interest income on higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of the cash proceeds received from our initial public offering in march and our follow on public offering in february and the impact of higher interest rates in compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the million in expenses for the year ended december  were comprised of project costs associated with the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at cambrex baltimore totaling million  internal personnel and other costs totaling million  and our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd totaling million 
in the year ended december   project costs for the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process increased million from the same period in  and were driven primarily by production and validation activities at cambrex baltimore 
the costs associated with our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd for the year ended december  increased by approximately million from the same period in the severe primary igfd and primary igfd project costs related primarily to conducting several small studies  the analyses of clinical trial data  nda filing preparations for severe primary igfd and start up costs related to the trials in primary igfd 
personnel costs for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase of million was attributable to increased personnel costs of million  increased sales and marketing expenses of million and increased corporate administration expenses such as legal  insurance  information technology and other expenses of million 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development expense decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in the costs in resulted from a million payment to genentech related to the exclusive license to genentech s worldwide rights  including the united states  to igf combined with igfbp for all indications  other than diseases and conditions of the central nervous system  and  of costs resulting from the execution of a patent license 
the costs in resulted from the execution of our international license 
table of contents and collaboration agreement with genentech and were comprised of cash of million 
this agreement allows us to market and sell increlex outside of the united states for all indications other than diseases or conditions of the central nervous system 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase was due to interest income on higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of the cash proceeds received from the issuance of series b preferred stock in july and from our initial public offering in march preferred stock dividend 
in july  we sold  shares of series b preferred stock at per share  for total cash proceeds of approximately million 
the difference between the preferred stock sales price and the reassessed value per share of common stock on the transaction date resulted in a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of million 
the beneficial conversion feature has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the statement of operations for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  which was primarily comprised of million of accumulated net losses and million of a non cash deemed dividend related to the beneficial conversion feature of convertible preferred stock 
we have funded our operations and growth from inception through december  with net cash proceeds of million in private equity financings and million from our public offerings of common stock 
on january   we completed a public offering of our common stock under a shelf registration  in which we raised net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  of million  together with the net proceeds of our public offering completed in january and our ceff  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of based on our current business plan 
senior credit facility pursuant to our loan agreement with vll  we had the option to draw down funds in the aggregate principal amount of up to million 
we paid a  fee as part of this loan agreement and issued a total of  shares of our common stock to an affiliate of vll 
the facility expired on december   and we did not borrow any funds under this facility 
committed equity financing facility under the terms of the ceff  kingsbridge committed to purchase a maximum of approximately million newly issued shares of our common stock over a three year period beginning in october  for cash up to an aggregate of million  subject to certain conditions 
we may draw down under the ceff in tranches of up to the lesser of million or of our market capitalization at the time of the draw down of such tranche  subject to certain conditions 
the common stock to be issued for each draw down will be issued and priced over an eight day pricing period at discounts ranging from to from the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the pricing period 
during the term of the ceff  kingsbridge may not short our stock  nor may it enter into any derivative transaction directly related to our stock 
the minimum acceptable purchase price  prior to the application of the appropriate discount for any shares to be sold to kingsbridge during the eight day 
table of contents pricing period  is determined by the greater of or of our closing share price on the trading day immediately prior to the commencement of each draw down 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we intend to exercise our right to draw down amounts under the ceff  if and to the extent available  at such times as we have a need for additional capital and when we believe that sales of our common stock under the ceff provide an appropriate means of raising capital 
however  we are not obligated to sell any of the million of common stock available under the ceff  and there are no minimum commitments or minimum use penalties 
cash flow cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the increase in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in a follow on public offering  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
cash used in operating activities in includes the receipt of a million reimbursement from our landlord for facility improvements which was recognized as deferred rent 
the increase in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of our common stock in our initial public offering  partially offset by cash used in operating activities of million 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities from was primarily due to the increase of our net loss in compared to  which is discussed above in the results of operations  and the capitalization of inventory after we obtained fda approval of increlex  offset by the recognition of the leasehold improvement allowance received from our landlord 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in was due to increased personnel and infrastructure costs  the establishment and validation of our rhigf manufacturing process at cambrex baltimore  and our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities represent purchases  sales and maturities of investments and purchases of property and equipment net against proceeds received from the sale of equipment 
net purchases of short term investments were million in  an increase of million from due to the relatively short term maturities of our investment portfolio during and  the increases and decreases in net purchases of short term investments were primarily due to timing of maturities  sales and purchases of short term investments 
net purchases of short term investments were million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in net purchases of short term investments in compared to was due primarily to the relatively short term maturities of our investment portfolio during resulting in lower net purchases of short term investments and the increased cash inflows from our series b financing in resulting in higher net purchases of short term investments 
purchases of property and equipment were million in  an increase of million from the increase in purchases of property and equipment in primarily relate to the purchase of leasehold improvements and office furniture for our new offices located in brisbane  california  and the purchase of computer equipment and software for new employees hired in proceeds received from the sale of equipment was million in  compared to in purchases of property and equipment were million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in purchases of property and equipment in primarily relate to the timing of property and equipment purchases in compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities primarily relate to net proceeds received from our public offerings of common stock and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans 
net proceeds received from our public offerings of common stock were million and million in and  respectively

table of contents litigation on december   we initiated patent infringement proceedings against avecia limited and insmed incorporated as co defendants in the high court of justice chancery division patents court in the united kingdom 
there is no trial date set for this action 
on december   we  with genentech  initiated patent infringement proceedings against insmed incorporated in the us district court for the northern district of california 
we initiated these litigations because we believe that insmed and avecia are infringing and or have infringed on our patents that cover insmed s product s use and manufacture 
the trial date is november   however  on march   we filed a motion to accelerate the trial date 
we cannot predict the outcome of our litigation against avecia and insmed in the united kingdom or the outcome of our litigation against insmed in the united states 
moreover  we cannot predict the cost of such litigation  which may require a substantial diversion of our financial assets and other resources and consequently prevent us from allocating sufficient resources to the development of our rhigf programs  and which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  if the outcome of our litigation in the united kingdom is not favorable to us  we are likely to be found liable for the opposing parties costs incurred in connection with the litigation  and we could be found liable for an award of additional damages to the opposing parties if the court decides that our claims of patent infringement are without sufficient merit or not pursued in good faith 
if in our litigation in the united states  the court decides that a defendant prevails  and the defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the case is exceptional eg  our claims of patent infringement were not pursued in good faith  we could be liable for an award of the opposing party s costs and legal fees incurred in connection with the litigation and or an award of other damages 
any such award or awards to the opposing parties could substantially increase our costs and exacerbate the negative impact that an unfavorable outcome in the case s could have on our business 
further  it is not uncommon in cases of this kind for a defendant to assert counterclaims  which could significantly increase our costs  potential liability for damages  and other risks arising from these lawsuits  and a court could find us liable for any such damages caused by genentech as well 
on december   we filed a complaint against insmed for false advertising and unfair competition  case no 
c sba  in the us district court  northern district of california 
the complaint alleges that insmed made false  misleading and deceptive statements about increlex and its product 
we are seeking monetary and injunctive relief 
we filed an amended complaint on december  defendant insmed filed a motion to dismiss on january  the motion is scheduled to be heard on march  discovery has not commenced  and no trial date has been set 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments our commitments for operating leases include leases for our present office facility and office equipment 
in  we obtained a  irrevocable letter of credit in conjunction with the lease agreement covering our present facility 
this irrevocable letter of credit is collateralized for the same amount by cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held in a company bank account and has been recorded as restricted cash 
we also have contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
under our license agreements with genentech  aggregate payments of up to million would be due if milestones relating to the initial product approval of rhigf for severe primary igfd in europe are achieved 
additional milestone payments would be due for subsequent indication approvals  including for approvals of products consisting of rhigf or igf binding protein  in the united states or europe 

table of contents under our agreement with cambrex baltimore  we have a non cancelable obligation to reimburse cambrex baltimore on a time and materials and per batch basis in connection with the commercial production of increlex 
we estimate that our total purchase commitment to cambrex baltimore is approximately million through december  further  as we reach certain milestones  we will be committed to make certain future purchases 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  of million  together with the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in january of approximately million and our ceff  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of based on our current business plan 
we plan to make significant expenditures to support our marketing  sales  clinical trial  regulatory  and manufacturing development activities 
we expect to focus on commercial launch activities for severe primary igfd and continue to expand our development projects for severe primary igfd and primary igfd 
we also expect to make significant legal expenditures for our ongoing litigations 
we obtained approval for the long term treatment of growth failure in children with severe primary igfd or with growth hormone gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to growth hormone from the fda in august  and we are marketing increlex for those indications 
in addition  we submitted an maa to emea seeking approval to market increlex in the european union for an indication that is similar 
we are also conducting two late stage clinical trials for the use of increlex in primary igfd as well as other clinical activities 
our projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
these projects may also yield varying results that could delay  limit or change the timing of a project s advancement through various stages of product development and significantly impact the costs to be incurred in bringing a project to completion 
as a result  the costs to complete such projects  as well as the timing of net cash outflows  are not reasonably estimable 
our future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to market and sell sufficient quantities of rhigf  the costs  timing and scope of additional domestic and international regulatory approvals for rhigf  the status of competing products  the commercial readiness of our rhigf manufacturing operations at cambrex baltimore  including the success of our cgmp production activities  the success of drug product manufacturing and results of stability and product comparability studies performed at third party contractors  the rate of progress and cost of our future clinical trials and other research and development activities  and the pace of expansion of administrative expenses 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the costs to complete our projects through product commercialization are not accurately predictable 
results from regulatory review  manufacturing operations and clinical trials may not be favorable 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  our development projects are subject to risks  uncertainties and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
as a result  our capital requirements may increase in future periods 

table of contents we expect that we will require and attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including the ceff 
however  there is no assurance that additional funding will be available to finance our operations when needed or on acceptable terms 
additional funding may also result in dilution to our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate debt securities  commercial paper  federal agency bonds  repurchase agreements and money market funds 
our cash and cash equivalents through december  included liquid money market accounts 
our short term investments included readily marketable debt securities 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
