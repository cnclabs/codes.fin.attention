overview we are a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is comprised of three segments architectural products and services architectural  large scale optical lso and automotive replacement glass and services auto glass 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass and windows primarily comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  a leading fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation  maintenance and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall  and linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  a value added glass and acrylic manufacturer for the custom picture framing market  and a producer of optical thin film coatings for consumer electronics displays 
this segment also provides wall d cor  including pre framed art and mirrors 
our auto glass segment consists of viracon curvlite  a us fabricator of foreign and domestic aftermarket automotive replacement glass arg  and original equipment manufacturers oem and aftermarket recreational and bus windshields 
architectural segment 
our architectural segment is the largest and most cyclical segment in our portfolio 
the segment services the commercial construction markets  which improved during our two most recent fiscal years compared to the prior two years 
we are anticipating market conditions to continue to improve throughout fiscal based on market forecasts provided by external sources 
although we grew at a faster pace than the non residential construction market based on reports by mcgraw hill construction fw dodge  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends  our margins were negatively impacted by a high mix of projects negotiated earlier in the construction cycle and increased material and energy related costs 
improving markets  better project selection processes that should improve project mix and our continued efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiencies leave us optimistic about improved results for this segment in fiscal we continue to execute against our strategic initiative to grow our architectural glass market share with energy efficient  hurricane and blast products for the office high rise condominium  health care  education and institutional markets 
to that end  we expended approximately million to expand and upgrade our glass fabrication facilities in georgia and minnesota in fiscal  and we also announced plans to invest approximately million to construct a new glass fabrication facility in st 
george  utah  which we expect to begin operating in fiscal this new facility will provide the southwest united states market with high performance architectural glass and energy efficient solutions for large complex projects as well as smaller projects with faster turnaround times and reduced delivery costs 

table of contents our second strategy within the architectural segment is to continue to strengthen our businesses that manufacture windows and curtainwall  install glass on new buildings  and renovate and service window and curtainwall systems on older buildings 
much of the focus during fiscal was to integrate the acquisition of architectural wall solutions  inc awalls made in the fourth quarter fiscal into our glass installation business and to streamline part of its operations through centralized manufacturing centers 
these actions strengthened our organization and increased market penetration in the midwest and northwest regions of the united states 
we are leveraging our strong brand to transform our glass installation business into a national company with a local presence 
apogee continued to focus on capturing share in the us metropolitan areas we currently serve  while selectively entering new markets 
the project management skills of our installation business  also the largest in the country  are especially valued in medium to high end projects 
additionally  apogee s commercial window business  well known for its higher end  custom engineered windows  began evaluating opportunities to expand sales of lower cost standard windows for markets such as education and health care 
lso segment 
our picture framing strategy of converting the custom framing market to our value added products continues to thrive as fiscal results for this segment demonstrate 
for the year  we exceeded our goal by increasing value added glass by more than percent 
as a result  we continued to shift the mix of this segment s sales away from the less profitable consumer electronics sector 
going forward  apogee s picture framing business is partnering with customers to increase the conversion to value added glass 
efforts include influencing consumer product choice through marketing programs  as well as making value added framing glass more affordable 
to help framers sell consumers value added products while better operating their businesses  the company is offering framing shops point of sale software 
apogee also is pursuing increased institutional and fine art museum customers  who especially value the preservation and safety features of our framing glass and acrylic 
auto glass segment 
although our remaining auto glass manufacturing business and our distribution joint venture with ppg face market conditions at lower volume and pricing compared to five years ago  we expect they will generate positive cash for apogee during fiscal and into the future 
in july  the supply agreement our manufacturing business had with ppg industries expired  and our business began transitioning its volume from ppg to focus on selling to arg wholesalers and distributors  including ppg  which value our short lead times for aftermarket auto windshields

also  the net proceeds of million from a class action lawsuit settlement with certain flat glass manufacturers with respect to glass purchases from to increased the fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales by percentage points 
offsetting these increases were the effects of the termination in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the pricing amendments to the company s supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture  which negatively impacted the auto glass segment s results and the company s gross profit percentage by percentage points  while positively impacting equity in income of affiliated companies
