the products power systems are incorporated into virtually all electronic products  such as computers and telecommunications equipment  to convert electric power from a primary source  for example a wall outlet or battery source  into the stable dc voltages required by electronic circuits 
because power systems are arranged in a myriad of application specific configurations  the company s basic strategy is to exploit the density and performance advantages of its technology by offering comprehensive families of economical  component level building blocks which can be used to configure a power system specific to a user s needs 
in addition to component level power converters  which serve as modular power system building blocks  the company also manufactures and sells complete configurable power systems  accessory products  and custom power solutions 
the company operates in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of power conversion components and systems 
the company s principal product lines include modular power converters the company currently offers four first generation families of component level dc dc power converters the vi  vi j  mi  and mi j families 
designed to be mounted directly on a printed circuit board assembly and soldered in place using contemporary manufacturing processes  each family comprises a comprehensive set of products which are offered in a wide range of input voltage  output voltage and power ratings 
this allows end users to select products appropriate to their individual applications 
the product families differ in maximum power ratings  performance characteristics  package size and  in certain cases  in target market 
since  the company has introduced four families of its second generation of high power density  component level dc dc converters 
in  the volt input family was introduced  which was designed for the telecommunications market as well as for distributed power systems 
the products consist of modules with the most popular output voltages in all three of the company s second generation standard packages the full size maxi  the half size mini and the quarter size micro 
output power levels from to watts are covered by these second generation products 
in  this was followed by two additional families a volt input for off line rectified or volt ac and distributed power applications  and a volt input specifically designed for use in power factor corrected systems 
this latter family increased the power available to watts 
in  a volt input family was added to the standard second generation product line to address additional telecommunications  industrial and defense market opportunities 
the vicor design assistance computer vdac was introduced for general use in and is a proprietary system which enables vicor s customers to specify on line  and verify in real time  the performance and attributes of second generation dc dc converters 
using patented technology  vdac enables the design of second generation dc dc converters with any output voltage between and volt and with any input voltage from to volt  with an input voltage range of up to  available in all of the vicor established brick standards  full  half and quarter size

in  picor introduced the qpi  the industry s first system in a package sip device designed to integrate the total hot swap function with an active emi filter 
this integrated device enables live insertion of plug in cards and simultaneous emi noise suppression for dc dc converter applications 
customer specific products since its inception  the company has accepted a certain amount of custom power supply business 
in most cases  the customer was unable to obtain a conventional solution that could achieve the desired level of performance in the available space 
by utilizing its component level power products as core elements in developing most of these products  the company was able to meet the customer s needs with a reliable  high power density  total solution 
however  in keeping with the company s strategy of focusing on sales of 
table of contents standard families of component level power building blocks  custom product sales have not been directly pursued 
the company has traditionally pursued these custom opportunities through value added resellers vars and a network of vias see part i  item business the company 
most of the vias are majority owned by the company  while vars are independent businesses 
both vias and vars are distributed geographically and are in close proximity to many of their customers 
european union restriction of hazardous substances rohs the company has elected to comply with the european union s eu directive on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  referred to as rohs or as the lead free directive 
the company has established a formal plan to make vicor products compliant with this directive ahead of the designated july  deadline 
compliance will involve working with certain suppliers and customers  may potentially require the redesign of certain products and may require the modification of certain manufacturing processes see part i  item i risk factors

backlog as of december   the company had a backlog of approximately million compared to million at december  backlog is comprised of orders for products which have a scheduled shipment date within the next months 
the company believes that a substantial portion of sales in each quarter is  and will continue to be  derived from orders booked in the same quarter 
research and development as a basic element of its long term strategy  the company is committed to the continued advancement of power conversion technology and power component product development 
the company s research and development efforts are focused in four areas continued enhancement of the company s patented technology  expansion of the company s families of component level dc dc converter products  development of the new fpa products and power management integrated circuits  and continued development of configurable products based upon market opportunities 
the company invested approximately million  million and million in research and development in  and  respectively 
investment in research and development represented  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
the company plans to continue to invest a significant percentage of revenues into research and development 
manufacturing the company s principal manufacturing processes consist of assembly of electronic components onto printed circuit boards  automatic testing of components  wave  reflow and infrared soldering of assembled components  encapsulation of converter subassemblies  final environmental stress screening of certain products and product test using automatic test equipment 
the company continues to pursue its strategy to minimize manual assembly processes  reduce manufacturing costs  increase product quality and reliability and ensure its ability to rapidly and effectively

the strategy is based upon the phased acquisition and or fabrication  qualification and integration of automated manufacturing equipment 
the company plans to make continuing investments in manufacturing equipment  particularly for the company s new fpa products see part i  item i the products factorized power architecture 
components used in the company s products are purchased from a variety of vendors 
most of the components are available from multiple sources 
in instances of single source items  the company maintains levels of inventories it considers to be appropriate to enable it to meet delivery requirements of customers 
incoming components  assemblies and other parts are subjected to several levels of inspection procedures 
compliance by the company with applicable environmental laws has not had a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
second generation products revenues of second generation products increased by in over  unit production increased  and orders increased 
both first and second generation products are sold to similar customers 
gross margins on second generation products continue to be significantly lower than those of first generation products  principally due to high depreciation expense associated with second generation manufacturing equipment 
the process of converting second generation products to the new fastrak platform is substantially complete  with the last units scheduled for conversion in the first quarter of the last production and shipment of products based on the original second generation platform is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of the conversion to fastrak has resulted in lower unit costs  improved manufacturing yields  improved field reliability and improved gross margins 
the company is actively working towards continued yield improvement and cost reduction on fastrak products 
there can be no assurance that such volumes  yields or cost reductions can be attained 
competition the power conversion industry is highly competitive 
many power supply manufacturers target markets similar to those of the company 
representative examples of these manufacturers are lambda electronics  a subsidiary of tdk corporation  the former power systems business unit of lucent technologies  now a subsidiary of tyco international  ltd  artesyn technologies  astec power  a subsidiary of emerson electric company  power one  inc  and c d technologies  inc  power electronics division 
although certain of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and longer operating histories than the company  the company believes that it has a strong competitive position  particularly with customers who need small  high density power system solutions requiring a variety of input output configurations 
the company bases its competitive strategy on technical innovation  product performance  service and technical support  and in offering a broad product line 
the principal methods of competition in the markets in which the company s products compete are price  performance and the level of service and technical support offered 
patents the company believes that its patents afford advantages by building fundamental and multilayered barriers to competitive encroachment upon key features and performance benefits of its principal product families 
the company s patents cover the fundamental conversion topologies used to achieve the performance attributes of its converter product lines  converter array architectures which are the basis of the products parallelability  product packaging design  product construction  high frequency magnetic structures  and automated equipment and methods for circuit and product assembly 
on february   the united states patent and trademark office issued us patent re  the reissue patent as a reissue of us patent  the reset patent 
the reissue patent includes original claims through of the reset patent plus additional new claims 
the claims in the reissue patent cover non coincident active clamp technology in a broadly defined class of single ended forward converters and enable design of power converters which are smaller and more energy efficient than 
table of contents conventional power supplies 
the claims cover  but are not limited to  so called zero voltage switching technology 
the company believes that its rights under the reset patent and the reissue patent have been infringed 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
the company has been issued patents in the united states which expire between and  in europe which expire between and  and in japan which expire between and 
the company also has a number of patent applications pending in the united states  europe and the far east 
the company intends to vigorously protect its rights under its patents 
although the company believes that patents are an effective way of protecting its technology  there can be no assurances that the company s patents will prove to be enforceable see  eg  part i  item legal proceedings 
while some of the company s patents are deemed materially important to the company s operations  the company believes that no one patent is essential to the success of the company 
licensing in addition to generating revenue from product sales  licensing is an element of the company s strategy for building worldwide product and technology acceptance and market share 
in granting licenses  the company generally retains the right to use its patented technologies  and manufacture and sell its products  in all licensed geographic areas and fields of use 
licenses are granted and administered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  vlt  inc  which owns the company s patents 
revenues from licensing arrangements have not exceeded of the company s consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years 
on march   the company announced that its wholly owned subsidiaries  vicor hong kong ltd 
vhk and vlt  inc vlt  had entered into cooperative agreements with nagano japan radio company  ltd 
njrc 
on march   njrc gave vhk and vlt notice of termination of the agreements  effective september  in january  the company received a final royalty payment from njrc 
on october   the company announced that it entered into a non exclusive license with celestica corporation to manufacture and sell the v i chip product family 
v i chips are the building blocks of the new fpa products that vicor announced in april in september  the company was notified that celestica s power systems division had been acquired by c d technologies  inc and that the license was being assigned to c d 
on june   the company announced that it had entered into a non exclusive license with sony corporation sony to design and manufacture power converters  using v i chip technology and factorized power  for use within its products and for sale to its customers in certain agreed upon applications 
the license also grants sony rights to manufacture certain semiconductor components that are used in v i chips 
royalties are based upon the value of the licensed converters used or sold 
employees as of december   the company employed approximately  full time and part time people 
the company believes that its continued success depends  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
although there is strong demand for qualified technical personnel  the company has not to date experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient engineering and technical personnel to meet its needs see part i  item i risk factors 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
item a risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the risk factors set forth below 

table of contents our future operating results are subject to fluctuations 
our future operating results may be materially affected by a number of factors  including the level of orders and demand from customers  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or our competitors  the ability to achieve yield improvements and cost reductions particularly with fastrak and fpa products  changes in the product mix  and changes in economic conditions in the united states and international markets 
as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and market leading edge  cost effective products 
the power supply industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion for mature products  each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we fail to continue to develop and commercialize leading edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality  our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
specifically  we may not be successful in leveraging the v i chips in standard products to promote market acceptance of factorized power 
our future operating results are dependent on the growth in our customers businesses 
we manufacture modular power components and power systems that are incorporated into our customers electronic products 
our growth is therefore dependent on the growth in the sales of our customers products as well as the development by our customers of new products 
if we fail to anticipate changes in our customers businesses and their changing product needs  our financial position could be negatively impacted 
if we were unable to use our manufacturing facility in andover  massachusetts  we would not be able to manufacture for an extended period of time 
all modular power components  whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries for incorporation into their respective products  are manufactured at our andover  massachusetts production facility 
damage to this facility due to fire  natural disaster  power loss or other events could cause us to cease manufacturing 
any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of this facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our conversion of second generation products to the fastrak platform may not achieve our anticipated results 
the process of converting second generation products to the new fastrak platform is substantially complete 
the conversion to fastrak has resulted in lower unit costs  improved manufacturing yields  improved field reliability and improved gross margins  while supporting the worldwide rohs initiative 
we cannot assure you that the improved results due to the conversion of second generation products to the fastrak platform will continue as expected 
during the second quarter of  we provided additional reserves of approximately  for potential obsolete inventory arising from the rohs initiative and the conversion of second generation products to the fastrak platform 
the remaining product conversion and rohs initiative could result in additional reserve requirements and negatively impact our results of operations 
also  once the conversion is completed  certain second generation automated manufacturing equipment may have little or no future use 
this may result in the impairment of any remaining net book value of those assets 
during the third quarter of  the useful lives of certain equipment in connection with the conversion were shortened  which resulted in higher depreciation expense on this equipment in our revenues may not increase enough to offset the expense of additional capacity 
we have made significant additions to our manufacturing equipment and capacity over the past several years  including equipment for fpa products and the fastrak platform 
if overall revenue levels do not increase enough to offset the increased fixed costs  or significant revenues do not materialize for the fpa 
table of contents products or if there is deterioration in our business  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  asset values could be impaired if the additional capacity is underutilized for an extended period of time 
we rely on third party suppliers and subcontractors for components and assemblies and  therefore  cannot control their availability or quality 
we depend on third party suppliers and subcontractors to provide components and assemblies used in our products 
if suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications  we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected 
in addition  we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties 
in order to grow  we may need to find new or change existing suppliers and subcontractors 
this could cause disruptions in production  delays in the shipping of product or increases in prices paid to third parties 
we are exposed to economic  political and other risks through our foreign sales and distributors 
international sales have been and are expected to be a significant component of total sales 
dependence on foreign third parties for sales and distribution is subject to special risks  such as foreign economic and political instability  foreign currency controls and market fluctuations  trade barriers and tariffs  foreign regulations and exchange rates 
sudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers 
the loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
in particular  we are dependent on the services of dr 
patrizio vinciarelli  our founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of dr 
vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations 
in addition  we depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills that are in high demand and are difficult to replace 
our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel in a very competitive employment market 
if we are unable to attract and retain these employees  our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
we operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies which must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies 
we devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights  and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights 
this protection  however  may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products 
we may be unable to protect or enforce current patents  may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict  or may be unable to acquire patents in the future  and this may have a material adverse affect on our competitive position 
in addition  the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those of the united states 
we have been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents 
we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in and devote significant resources to these efforts which  if unsuccessful  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to resolve 
we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
in the event a 
table of contents third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology  and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement  and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of key personnel 
an adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations and financial condition 
compliance with the eu s rohs may not proceed as planned 
we have elected to comply with the eu directive on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  referred to as rohs or as the lead free directive 
we have established a formal plan to make vicor products compliant with this directive ahead of the designated july  deadline 
compliance will involve working with certain suppliers and customers  may potentially require the redesign of certain products and may require the modification of certain manufacturing processes 
as a result  the following situations could negatively impact our results of operations our suppliers may experience increased demand for rohs compliant components from their customers and therefore  may not be able to meet our specific requirements or delivery schedules  and we may not be able to meet the demand for our products  and our delivery times may be negatively affected 
customers mandate that they will not accept rohs directive compliant product  and such requirements could significantly increase the cost of maintaining business with these customers 
customers transition to rohs compliant product may be unpredictable  and forecast inaccuracy may negatively impact material availability 
the modification of our manufacturing processes may require the additional investment in equipment  which will increase operating expenses 
in  we invested approximately  for new equipment in support of rohs initiatives 
the conversion over to compliant materials could result in excess supplies of raw materials that are no longer needed for non compliant products 
additional inventory reserves could be required for such excess materials and would negatively impact our results of operations 
during the second quarter of  we provided additional inventory reserves of approximately  for potential obsolete inventory from the rohs initiative 
item b unresolved staff comments the company has not received written comments from the securities and exchange commission regarding its periodic or current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  that were received days or more before december  and remain unresolved 
item properties the company s corporate headquarters building  which the company owns and which is located in andover  massachusetts  provides approximately  square feet of office space for its sales  marketing  engineering and administration personnel 
the company also owns a building of approximately  square feet in andover  massachusetts  which houses all massachusetts manufacturing activities 
the company s westcor division owns and occupies a building of approximately  square feet in sunnyvale  california 
item legal proceedings vicor and vlt  inc vlt  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  are pursuing reset patent infringement claims directly against artesyn technologies  lucent technologies and tyco electronics power systems  inc in the united states district court in boston  massachusetts 
the lawsuit against lucent was 
table of contents filed in may and in april  the company added tyco electronics as a defendant in that lawsuit 
the lawsuit against artesyn was filed in february in january  the district court issued a pre trial decision in each of these patent infringement lawsuits relating to claim construction of the reset patent 
the district court s decisions rejected assertions that the reset patent claims are invalid for indefiniteness  and affirmed vicor s interpretation of several terms used in the reset patent claims 
however  the district court adopted interpretations of certain terms of the reset patent claims that are contrary to vicor s position 
on may   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the decisions issued in january by the district court

table of contents the following table sets forth certain items of selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
this table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes of the company contained elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company employs a variety of methodologies to estimate allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
historically  the company estimated reserves for its inventory at all significant locations based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
in the second quarter of  the company revised its method for estimating inventory reserves at the andover location  its principal manufacturing location 
the revised model is based upon a comparison of on hand quantities to projected demand  such that amounts on hand in excess of three year projected usage are fully reserved 
while we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand  due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in predicting future demand  it is possible that actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill 
table of contents and other intangible assets fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company periodically assesses the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
goodwill is tested for potential impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
the company periodically evaluates whether any indicators of impairment surrounding the investment in great wall semiconductor corporation gws are present and  if so  whether any adjustments to the carrying value of the investments in gws should be recorded 
deterioration or changes in the company s or gws business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
warranty the company generally warrants its products for a period of two years 
vicor maintains allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax assets is warranted at december  in reaching this conclusion  the company evaluated all relevant criteria including the existence of significant temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period  primarily depreciation 
the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
in addition  the assessment of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates of future taxable income and to estimate reversals of temporary differences 
changes in the assumptions or other circumstances may require additional valuation allowances if actual reversals of temporary differences differ from those estimates 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is  therefore  subject to a variety of income and related taxes 
the company has provided for potential tax liabilities due in various jurisdictions which it judges to be probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies 
judgment is required in determining the income tax expense and related tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the company believes it has reasonably estimated its accrued taxes for all jurisdictions for all open tax periods 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its tax and related accruals on a quarterly basis and adjusts appropriately as events warrant and open tax periods close 
it is possible that the final tax outcome of these matters will be different from management s estimate reflected in the income tax provisions and accrued taxes 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices for product failure claims or that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others or for other matters 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
in making this assessment  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and 
table of contents circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with fas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  if any  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations

the company s short term and long term investments consist mainly of corporate debt securities 
these debt securities are all highly rated investments  in which a significant portion have interest rates reset at auction at regular intervals 
as a result  the company believes there is minimal market risk to these investments 
our annual interest income would change by approximately  in for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the operations of vjcl and changes in the dollar yen exchange rate 
relative to foreign currency exposure against the yen existing at december   a unfavorable movement in the dollar yen exchange rate would increase the foreign currency loss by approximately  in addition  the functional currency of the company s subsidiaries in europe and hong kong is the us dollar 
therefore  the company believes that market risk is mitigated since these operations are not exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations
