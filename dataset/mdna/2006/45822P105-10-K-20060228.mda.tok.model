item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction  wps resources wps energy services and market price risk management activities wps resources 
facilities in the second quarter of  the allocated emission allowances associated with the sunbury generation station  located in shamokin dam  pennsylvania were sold for approximately million to multiple counterparties 
the sunbury plant will be operated in the future when market conditions make operations economical 
esi has emission allowances available for expected operations in esi will purchase additional emission allowances as needed to support planned operations 
as part of the asset management strategy of wps resources  esi continues to explore opportunities regarding the future of its electric generation and natural gas storage facilities 
opportunities include  but are not limited to sales of certain facilities  joint ventures and long term contracts 
opportunities change and develop with the dynamics of the markets in which we operate 
esi owns and operates electric generation facilities in the midwest and northeast regions of the united states with a total capacity of approximately megawatts 
at december   esi owned of a billion cubic foot natural gas storage field in kimball  michigan 
in february  esi acquired the remaining ownership interest in the facility 
the storage field allows for additional flexibility in supplying natural gas retail and wholesale customers  sale of storage services to the market and potential power generation peaking services 
esi s beaver falls generation facility is currently out of service as a result of damage to its turbine blades 
esi is reviewing its options regarding future operations of the facility 
for additional information regarding generation facilities of esi  see item properties in this annual report on form k 
fuel supply esi s fuel inventory policy varies for each generation facility depending on the type of fuel used and available storage facilities 
esi s merchant generation facilities excluding its gas fired plants historically  burn in excess of million tons of solid fuel annually 
fuel for these facilities includes coal  fluid coke  tire derived fuel and wood 
the majority of these needs will be met through the burning of coal products  including bituminous coal  culm  silt and fluid coke a petroleum product 
actual fuel needs in will depend on market conditions and operational capability of these facilities 
the sunbury facility s inventory policy is to have a to day coal supply on site 
esi has coal supply under contract for all sunbury committed generation 
fuel needs for any additional generation will be purchased on the spot market 
esi also has sufficient transportation services under contract for all of the niagara facility maintains an eight day fuel inventory on site  with additional inventory maintained off site 
currently all fuel needs are purchased in the spot market with no long term fuel contracts in effect 
esi s westwood facility burns waste coal left behind by mining operations and has several years supply on site 
all fuel is located within a seven mile radius of the plant 
the stoneman facility currently has all of its coal needs under contract with options for fuel needs 
esi provides all natural gas supply for the natural gas fired facilities in beaver falls  syracuse and combined locks and currently has adequate transport and supply arrangements for projected needs 
licenses esi is a ferc licensed power marketer with import export authorization through the doe 
esi and certain of its subsidiaries are registered to sell retail electric service in various states including illinois  maine  massachusetts  michigan  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  rhode island  and virginia in the united states and the province of ontario in canada 
in december  esi began to develop a presence in the retail electricity market in texas and expects to be operational before the end of the second quarter of esi is registered to sell natural gas in various states including illinois  iowa  michigan  ohio  pennsylvania  new york and alberta canada 
esi also sells natural gas in wisconsin where no license is required 
esi s subsidiary  wps energy services of canada  is registered in the canadian provinces of alberta  british columbia  manitoba  nova scotia  ontario  quebec and saskatchewan 
esi is also a member of the following regional transmission operators and north american electric reliability council reliability regions independent electricity system operator located in ontario  electric reliability council of texas application pending  iso new england  miso  new brunswick system operator  northern maine independent system administrator  new york independent system operator  and pjm interconnection 
beginning january  and extending to december   ohio established an electric market development period  after which rates would be set at market based prices 
during this market development period  esi contracted to be the supplier for approximately  residential  small commercial and government facilities in the firstenergy service areas under the state of ohio provisions for opt out electric aggregation programs 
the public utilities commission of ohio and firstenergy established electric rates for consumers beginning in because a competitive bid auction ordered by the public utilities commission of ohio did not produce better benefits 
because the firstenergy plan is priced lower than current market power prices  esi discontinued service to customers of the existing aggregation programs after the expiration of these contracts in december the ohio legislature continues to work on the development of a statewide energy policy 
if the regulatory climate and market change esi may re enter the electric power market in ohio 
esi  through its michigan subsidiary  has established itself as a significant supplier to the industrial and commercial markets under the electric choice program in michigan 
recent high wholesale energy prices  coupled with approved and pending tariff changes for the michigan regulated utilities  have significantly lowered the savings customers can obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
as a result  many customers have returned to the bundled tariff service of the resident utility 
this has caused the michigan retail electric business at the beginning of to decline to one third of what it was at the start of future orders of the mpsc should clarify the outlook for electric choice 
the impact on esi could range from maintaining michigan business with little or no growth to an inability to re contract any business  leading to a possible decision by esi to exit michigan s electric market and redirect resources to other markets 
for more information on the legislative activity in michigan and ohio and its impact on esi  see the discussion on industry restructuring in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
all the ferc hydroelectric facility licenses held by esi subsidiaries are current 
the megawatt hydroelectric facility owned in new brunswick  canada  is not subject to licensing 
other matters customer segmentation although esi is not dependent on any one customer  a significant percentage of its retail sales volume is derived from industries related to paper and allied products  food and kindred products  chemicals and paint  and steel and foundries 
esi s concentration of sales in any single market sector is decreasing as it expands into the texas and northeast united states retail electric markets and eastern canada retail natural gas markets 
seasonality esi believes that its business  in the aggregate  is not seasonal  even though certain products sell more heavily in some seasons than in others 
sales of natural gas generally peak in the winter months  while sales of electric energy generally peak in the summer months 
generally in the summer months  the demand for electric energy is high  which increases the price at which energy can be sold 
in periods of high residential fuel consumption  generally the winter months the purchase price of oil and natural gas increases  which increases the production costs at esi s gas and oil fired generation facilities 
esi s business is volatile as a result of market conditions and the related market opportunities available to its customers 
competition esi is a nonregulated energy marketer that competes against regulated utilities  large energy trading companies and other energy marketers 
esi competes with other energy providers on the basis of price  reliability  service  financial strength  consumer convenience  performance and reputation 
the nonregulated energy market has seen a decrease in the number of large energy providers and there continues to be consolidation of small energy marketers 
the liquidity in the nonregulated energy market continues to improve with the increase of well capitalized wholesale market participants 
although this increases competition  it also allows esi to operate more efficiently 
working capital currently  capital requirements of esi are provided through equity infusions  long term debt and short term debt by its parent company  wps resources 
the working capital needs of esi vary significantly over time due to volatility in commodity prices including margin calls  levels of natural gas inventories  the structure of wholesale transactions  the price of natural gas and alternative energy opportunities available to its customers 
wps resources provides guarantees for esi s supply contracts 
these guarantees provide the financial strength needed to participate in the nonregulated energy market

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  when making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us 
we may not successfully integrate pending or future acquisitions into our operations or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we continue to pursue a disciplined acquisition strategy 
while we expect to identify cost savings and growth opportunities before we acquire companies or assets  we may not be able to achieve these anticipated benefits due to  among other things delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets  higher than expected costs or a need to allocate additional resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties  parameters imposed or delays caused by regulatory agencies  reliance on inaccurate assumptions in evaluating the expected benefits of a given acquisition  inability to retain key employees or customers of acquired companies  and assumption of liabilities not identified in the due diligence process 
these risks apply to our pending acquisition of aquila s michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations 
we may not complete construction projects within estimated project costs 
wpsc is currently in the process of constructing the megawatt weston base load generation facility at an estimated cost of million including the coal trains 
wpsc will be responsible for of these costs 
wpsc is also considering the possible construction of additional generation facilities in the future 
these and other projects also may be subject to joint ownership or operation agreements  completion of which will impact estimated project costs 
these are very large and complex construction projects  subject to numerous unpredictable events that could affect our ability to timely complete construction of these projects within estimated costs 
we may not be able to meet these construction estimates due to  among other things fluctuating or unanticipated construction costs  supply delays  legal claims  and environmental regulation 
we may not utilize section synthetic fuel production tax credits 
we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal income tax liability for the past several years through tax credits available to us under section of the internal revenue code for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel from coal 
we have not fully utilized section tax credits previously available to us 
our ability to fully utilize the section tax credits available to us in connection with our interest in the production facility will depend on whether the amount of our federal taxable income and related income tax liability is sufficient to permit the use of such credits 
the internal revenue service strictly enforces compliance with all of the technical requirements of section section tax credits are currently scheduled to expire at the end of any disallowance of some or all of those tax credits could materially affect our tax obligations and may also result in a reduction of the level of synthetic fuel production at the facility  thus reducing the likelihood and amount of future payments from other participants in the project 
future tax legislation and internal revenue service review may also affect the value of the credits and of our share of the facility 
at this time  we cannot predict the potential for or the outcome of any internal revenue service review 
we may not earn section synthetic fuel production tax credits or match related hedge earnings to production due to increasing oil prices 
the internal revenue code provides section tax credits based on the price of crude oil 
as the price of oil rises above certain thresholds  the allowable tax credit decreases 
if the price of oil rises high enough  the credit is eliminated 
in order to manage exposure to the risk that an increase in oil prices could reduce or eliminate the recognizable amount of section credits  esi has entered into a series of derivative contracts options covering a specified number of barrels of oil 
these derivatives mitigate section tax credit exposure related to rising oil prices in hedged and hedged 
however  the accounting period in which gains on these hedge agreements are recognized may not coincide with the accounting period projected for recognition of tax credits 
as a result  if the price of oil rises above the internal revenue code thresholds  income may be recognized in periods other than the period for which the section tax credits are projected 
our operations are subject to risks beyond our control  including but not limited to weather  terrorist attacks or related acts of war 
our revenues are affected by the demand for electricity and natural gas 
that demand can vary greatly based upon weather conditions  seasonality and temperature extremes  fluctuations in economic activity and growth in our regulated service areas  as well as texas  the northeast quadrant of the united states and adjacent portion of canada  and the amount of additional energy available from current or new competitors 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
in addition  the cost of repairing damage to our facilities due to storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events  in excess of reserves established for such repairs  may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist activity and the high cost or potential unavailability of insurance to cover such terrorist activity may impact our results of operations and financial condition in unpredictable ways 
these actions could also result in disruptions of power and fuel markets 
in addition  our natural gas distribution system and pipelines could be directly or indirectly harmed by future terrorist activity 
costs of environmental compliance  liabilities  fines  penalties and litigation could exceed our estimates 
compliance with current and future federal and state environmental laws and regulations may result in increased capital  operating and other costs  including remediation and containment expenses and monitoring obligations 
management cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures including the potential or magnitude of fines or penalties related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up and compliance costs and the possibility that changes will be made to the current environmental laws and regulations 
any future changes in the interpretation of the clean air act s new source review provisions could potentially increase our operating and maintenance costs substantially 
on march   the epa adopted the clean air mercury rule  which is intended to reduce mercury emissions from coal fired generation plants 
the epa has also issued the clean air interstate rule requiring reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions 
in addition  the possibility exists of future regulation of greenhouse gases emitted from generation facilities 
we cannot be certain how these rules will affect us 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liabilities on all potentially responsible parties 
citizen groups that feel there are compliance issues not sufficiently enforced by environmental regulatory agencies may bring citizen enforcement actions against us 
such actions could seek penalties  injunctive relief and costs of litigation 
the sierra club  inc and clean wisconsin  inc 
recently filed a complaint in the united states district court  eastern district of wisconsin  claiming that wpsc s pulliam facility violated provisions of its air permit 
on november   the sierra club filed a petition with the wdnr under section  wis 
stats 
seeking a contested case hearing on the air permit issued for the weston generation station 
in february  the administrative law judge affirmed the weston air permit with modifications to the emission limits for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from the coal fired boiler and particulate from the cooling tower 
the modifications set limits that are more stringent than those set by the wdnr 
wps resources is currently evaluating the impact this decision may have on future operating costs 
any change in our ability to sell electricity generated from our nonregulated facilities at market based rates may impact earnings 
the ferc has authorized us to sell generation from our nonregulated facilities at market prices 
the ferc retains the authority to modify or withdraw our market based rate authority 
if the ferc determines that the market is not workably competitive  that we possess market power or that we are not charging just and reasonable rates  it may require our nonregulated subsidiaries to sell power at a price based upon the costs incurred in producing the power 
our revenues and profit margins may be negatively affected by any reduction by the ferc of the rates we may receive 
fluctuating commodity prices may reduce regulated and nonregulated energy margins 
our regulated energy margins are directly affected by commodity costs related to coal  natural gas and other fuels used in the electric generation process 
the commodity price of market purchases of electricity also directly affects our regulated energy margins 
higher commodity prices increase energy prices and may impact customer demand for energy in the nonregulated market and increase counterparty risk 
this may stress margins at our nonregulated subsidiaries 
esi may experience increased expenses  including interest costs and uncollectibles  higher working capital requirements and possibly some reduction in volumes sold as a result of any increase in the cost of fuel or purchased power 
if market prices for electric energy decline below the cost of production at our nonregulated facilities  these units may be temporarily shut down and alternative sources of energy found to meet energy commitments 
we are subject to changes in government regulation  which may have a negative impact on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state regulatory agencies  which significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers 
in particular  the pscw  mpsc  ferc  sec  epa and the wdnr regulate many aspects of our utility operations  including siting and construction of facilities  conditions of service  the issuance of securities and the rates that we can charge customers 
we are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from these agencies to operate our business 
our acquisition of aquila s natural gas distribution operations in minnesota is subject to the approval of the regulatory commission in the state 
the rates our regulated utilities are allowed to charge for their retail and wholesale services are some of the most important items influencing our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations may require us to incur additional expenses or change business operations  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  federal regulatory reforms may produce unexpected changes and costs in the public utility industry 
a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot be sure that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade could increase our borrowing costs  require us to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and possibly reduce the potential pool of creditors  increase our borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities  limit our access to the commercial paper market  and limit the availability of adequate credit support for esi s operations 
actual results could differ from estimates used to prepare our financial statements 
in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and actual results could differ from those estimates 
for more information about these estimates and assumptions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in this annual report on form k 
the use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses and liquidity constraints 
we use derivative instruments  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  to manage our commodity and financial market risks 
in addition  we purchase and sell commodity based contracts in the natural gas and electric energy markets for trading purposes 
in the future  we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these contracts involves management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
additionally  realized values could differ from values determined by management 
for additional information concerning derivatives and commodity based trading contracts  see note risk management activities in this annual report on form k 
we are subject to provisions that can limit merger and acquisition opportunities for our shareholders 
the wisconsin public utility holding company law precludes the acquisition of or more of the voting shares of a holding company of a wisconsin public utility unless the pscw has first determined that the acquisition is in the best interests of utility consumers  investors and the public 
those interests may  to some extent  be mutually exclusive 
this provision and other requirements of the wisconsin public utility holding company law may delay  or reduce the likelihood of  a sale or change of control thus reducing the likelihood that shareholders will receive a takeover premium for their shares 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and may prevent or delay a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company that is not approved by our board of directors  even if the shareholders believe that such events may be beneficial to their interests 
in addition  our shareholder rights plan may have anti takeover effects by delaying  deferring or preventing an unsolicited acquisition proposal not approved by our board of directors  even if the shareholders believe that the proposal may be beneficial to their interests 
further  the wisconsin business corporation law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult attempts by others to obtain control of our company without the approval of our board of directors

a strong regulated utility base is important in order to maintain a strong balance sheet  more predictable cash flows  a desired risk profile  attractive dividends  and quality credit ratings  which are critical to our success 
wps resources believes the following recent developments have helped  or will help maintain and grow its regulated utility base wpsc is expanding its regulated generation fleet in order to meet growing electric demand and ensure continued reliability 
construction of the megawatt coal fired weston base load power plant near wausau  wisconsin  is underway  in partnership with dpc 
commercial operation is expected in wpsc continues to pursue plans to construct other electric generating facilities and will determine the details relating to fuel type and in service dates in the future 
in september  wps resources entered into a definitive agreement with aquila to acquire its natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota 
the addition of regulated assets in complementary vicinities to wps resources existing regulated electric and natural gas operations in wisconsin and michigan will transition wps resources to a larger and stronger regional energy company 
mpsc approval has already been received for the acquisition of the gas distribution operations in michigan  while the regulatory process required for approval of the acquisition of the minnesota operations is progressing on schedule 
we expect to complete both transactions in the first half of at december   wps resources owned of atc  which is a utility operation that owns  builds  maintains  and operates high voltage electric transmission lines primarily in wisconsin and upper michigan 
we continue to increase our ownership interest in atc through additional equity interest received as consideration for funding a portion of the duluth  minnesota  to wausau  wisconsin  transmission line 
wpsc continues to invest in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet the requirements set by environmental regulators 
capital projects to construct and upgrade equipment to meet or exceed required environmental standards are planned each year 
throughout the to time period  wpsc expects to invest approximately million in various environmental projects 
in  wpsc entered into a natural gas transportation precedent agreement with guardian pipeline  llc 
the agreement is subject to various approvals  including approvals by wps resources and guardian s boards of directors as well as approval by the pscw and the ferc 
the agreement is also contingent upon guardian pipeline obtaining financing 
to meet the requirements of the agreement  guardian pipeline will expand its current pipeline approximately miles in wisconsin 
integrate resources to provide operational excellence wps resources is committed to integrating resources of its regulated business units and also its nonregulated business units  while maintaining any and all applicable regulatory restrictions  in order to leverage the individual capabilities and expertise of each unit to provide the best value to all customers 
this strategy is demonstrated by the integration of resources at our nonregulated subsidiaries 
we started the integration by first implementing tolling agreements to move the market management of our plants to our portfolio management group  reducing our merchant generation market risk 
then we restructured the management teams of esi and pdi so that one team oversees all the operations of our nonregulated businesses 
this strategy will also be demonstrated in our regulated business by optimally sourcing work and combining resources to achieve best practices of wpsc and the natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota expected to be acquired in the first half of  operational excellence  and sustainable value for customers and shareholders 
strategically grow nonregulated businesses esi will grow its electric and natural gas business through strategic acquisitions  market penetration by existing businesses  and new product offerings by targeting growth in areas where it has the most market expertise and through strategic hiring in other areas 
esi also focuses on optimizing the operational efficiency of its existing portfolio of assets and pursues compatible development projects that strategically fit with its customer base and market expertise 
the acquisition of advantage energy in july provided esi with enhanced opportunities to compete in the new york market and had a positive impact on esi s margin in in  esi expanded advantage energy s customer base  and began introducing natural gas products to these customers 
the increase in advantage energy s customer base was aided by expanding its product offering  including offering both fixed and variable priced products 
prior to esi s acquisition of advantage energy  only variable priced products were offered 
in the third quarter of  esi began offering retail electric products primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in illinois 
previously  esi was only offering natural gas products and energy management services to customers in illinois 
in the fourth quarter of  esi began developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market 
due to the thriving texas market structure unencumbered by a regulated offering that is not market based and having been presented with a good opportunity and approach to enter the texas retail market  esi hired experienced personnel in that region and expects to be an approved competitive supplier before the end of the second quarter of esi previously had a market presence in houston with natural gas producer services originators 
while historically  esi limited its retail activities to the northeastern quadrant of the united states and adjacent portion of canada  the entry into the texas market offers an opportunity to leverage the infrastructure and capability esi developed to provide products and services that it believes customers will value 
esi began marketing electric products to customers in massachusetts in and has had initial success in signing up commercial and industrial customers 
place strong emphasis on asset and risk management one aspect of our asset management strategy calls for the continuing acquisition of assets that complement our existing business and strategy 
the utilities are the backbone of our earnings 
we expect esi to provide between and percent of our earnings in the future 
another aspect of this strategy calls for the disposition of assets  including plants and entire business units  which are either no longer strategic to ongoing operations or would reduce our risk profile 
the risk management portion of this strategy includes the management of market  credit and operational risk through the normal course of business 
the pending acquisitions of aquila s natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota will transition wps resources to a larger and stronger regional energy company 
the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances was completed in may for million 
the proceeds received from the sale enabled sunbury to eliminate its non recourse debt obligation  which provides greater flexibility as esi evaluates its options related to sunbury 
these options range from closing the plant  operating the plant only during favorable economic periods  to a future sale 
we also sold wpsc s interest in the kewaunee plant in july the major benefits of the kewaunee sale include transferring financial risk from wpsc s electric customers and wps resources shareholders to dominion  greater certainty of future energy costs through a fixed price power purchase agreement  and being able to return the non qualified decommissioning funds to our customers 
in the fourth quarter of  wpsc sold a interest in the weston power plant to dpc 
the sale of a portion of this plant reduces construction risk associated with the project  considering its magnitude  and reduces wpsc s funding requirements 
jointly owned plants also reduce the risk profile of wps resources 
in december  uppco sold a portion of real estate no longer needed for operations 
the gains from the sale of uppco s real estate assets will be shared between customers and shareholders as approved by the mpsc 
we continue to evaluate alternatives for the sale of the balance of our identified real estate holdings no longer needed for operation 
forward purchases and sales of electric capacity  energy  natural gas  and other commodities allow for opportunities to secure prices in a volatile price market 
an initiative we call competitive excellence is being deployed across our entire company 
competitive excellence strives to eliminate work that does not provide value for our customers 
this creates more efficient processes  improves the effectiveness of employees  and reduces costs 
regulated utilities our regulated utilities include wpsc and uppco 
wpsc derives its revenues primarily from the purchase  production  distribution  and sale of electricity  and the purchase  distribution  and sale of natural gas to retail customers in a service area of approximately  square miles in northeastern wisconsin and an adjacent portion of the upper peninsula of michigan 
the pscw and the mpsc regulate these retail sales 
uppco derives revenues from the purchase  production  distribution  and sale of electricity in a service area of approximately  square miles in the upper peninsula of michigan and is regulated by the mpsc 
wpsc and uppco both provide wholesale electric service to numerous utilities and cooperatives for resale 
ferc regulates wholesale sales 
the regulatory commissions allow the utilities to earn a return on common stock equity that is commensurate with an investor s expected return  compensating for the risks investors face when providing funds to the utility 
the return on common stock equity approved by the pscw  the ferc  and the mpsc was   and  respectively  in and   and  respectively  in the utilities bear volume risk as rates are based upon normal sales volumes as projected by the utility 
historically  consumers bear most of the price risk for fuel and purchased power costs as our regulators typically have allowed the utilities to recover most of these costs to the extent they are prudently incurred  through various cost recovery mechanisms 
however  the electric utility is exposed to the risk of not recovering increased fuel costs for wisconsin retail customers under the current electric fuel recovery rules 
under the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism  certain costs are only recoverable on a pro rata basis for the portion of the year after pscw approval 
as such  the ability of our regulated utilities to earn their approved return on equity is dependent upon accurate forecasting  the ability to obtain timely rate increases to account for rising cost structures while minimizing the required rate increases in order to maintain the competitiveness of our core industrial customer base and keep these customers in our service area  and certain conditions that are outside of their control such as macroeconomic factors and weather conditions 
to mitigate the risk of unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its risk policy approved by the pscw  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
on april   miso  of which wpsc and uppco are members  began operation of its day energy market 
within the day market  miso centrally dispatches wholesale electricity and provides transmission service to an area mainly in the midwest 
miso determines prices in the market based on a locational marginal pricing system determined by accepted generation bids and offers and the load to be served by market participants 
the introduction of the miso day market has shown positive results in that the system allows a more efficient use of the transmission system 
in addition to this  the miso day market may provide increased opportunities to reduce our generation costs and regulatory risks due to the changes in the regulatory environment explained above 
see other future considerations in liquidity and capital resources below for more information related to miso 
uncertainties related to the restructuring of the regulated environment are a risk for our regulated utilities 
the restructuring of natural gas service has begun in wisconsin 
currently  some of the largest natural gas customers are purchasing natural gas from suppliers other than their local utility 
efforts are underway to make it easier for smaller natural gas customers to do the same 
restructuring of electric regulation inside wisconsin is not currently being pursued 
the state is focused on improving reliability by building more generation and transmission facilities and creating fair market rules 
restructuring of electric regulation is present in michigan 
in the upper peninsula of michigan  no customers have chosen an alternative electric supplier and few alternative electric suppliers have offered to serve any customers in michigan s upper peninsula due to lack of transmission access and generating capacity in the areas we serve  which represents a barrier to competitive suppliers entering the market 
we have little or no control over some construction risks associated with projects that can negatively affect completion time and project costs 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the shortage of or inability to obtain labor or materials  unfavorable weather conditions  events in the economy  and changes in applicable laws or regulations 
esi esi offers nonregulated natural gas  electric  and alternate fuel supplies  as well as energy management and consulting services  to retail and wholesale customers primarily in the northeastern quadrant of the united states and adjacent portions of canada 
as discussed above  esi is also developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market 
although esi has a wide array of products and services  revenues are primarily derived through sales of electricity and natural gas to retail and wholesale customers 
esi s marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments and sales of generation from power plants 
esi strives to maintain a low risk portfolio  balancing natural gas and electricity purchase commitments with corresponding sales commitments 
in  esi purchased electricity required to fulfill these sales commitments primarily from independent generators  energy marketers  and organized electric power markets 
esi purchased natural gas from a variety of producers and suppliers under daily  monthly  seasonal  and long term contracts  with pricing delivery and volume schedules to accommodate customer requirements 
esi s customers include utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  commercial and industrial consumers  aggregators  and other marketing and retail entities 
esi uses derivative financial instruments to provide flexible pricing to customers and suppliers  manage purchase and sales commitments  and reduce exposure relative to volatile market prices 
esi also owns several merchant electric generation plants  primarily in the midwest and northeastern united states and adjacent portions of canada  which are listed in item  properties 
esi markets the power from plants not under contract to third parties 
esi utilizes power from its new england and canadian assets primarily to serve firm load commitments in northern maine and certain other sales agreements with customers 
for most of the remaining capacity available from these plants  esi utilizes financial tools  including forwards  options  and swaps  to mitigate exposure  as well as to maximize value from the merchant generation fleet 
power purchase agreements are also in place with third party customers for approximately megawatts of the total capacity  which includes the stoneman facility in cassville  wisconsin  and the combined locks facility in combined locks  wisconsin 
the table below discloses future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract as of december  contracts are generally one to three years in duration 
esi expects that its ultimate sales volumes in and beyond will exceed the volumes shown in the table below as it continues to seek growth opportunities and existing customers who do not have long term contracts continue to buy their short term requirements from esi 
forward contracted volumes at after wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes these tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods  however  there is a possibility that some of the contracted volumes reflected in the above table could be net settled 
management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically 
for comparative purposes  future natural gas and electric sales volumes under contract at december  are shown below 
actual electric and natural gas sales volumes for are disclosed within results of operations wps resources  esi segment operations 
forward contracted volumes at after wholesale sales volumes billion cubic feet retail sales volumes billion cubic feet total natural gas sales volumes wholesale sales volumes million kilowatt hours retail sales volumes million kilowatt hours total electric sales volumes these tables represent physical sales contracts for natural gas and electric power for delivery or settlement in future periods  however  there is a possibility that some of the contracted volumes reflected in the above table could be net settled 
management has no reason to believe that gross margins that will be generated by these contracts will vary significantly from those experienced historically 
wholesale electric and wholesale natural gas volumes under contract have increased at december   compared to december  natural gas throughput volumes in canada continue to increase and more volatile natural gas prices have provided increased structured wholesale natural gas opportunities 
the emphasis esi is placing on its originated wholesale customer electric business is also producing encouraging results  and in the fourth quarter of  esi added contracts to provide approximately  million kilowatt hours of electricity to customers in the future 
despite a challenging price environment  retail natural gas sales volumes under contract have increased slightly  while retail electric volumes under contract have decreased primarily due to a combination of industry restructuring and high energy prices in the michigan and ohio retail electric markets see liquidity and capital resources wps resources other future considerations  for more information 
esi continues to look for opportunities that fit within its growth strategy 
in  esi grew its retail electric business through the acquisition of retail operations in new york 
as discussed above  esi also began developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market 
esi expects to continue to target acquisitions and increase its customer base in existing markets 
as a company that participates in energy commodity markets  esi is exposed to a variety of risks  including market  operational  liquidity  and credit risks 
market risk is measured as the potential gain or loss of a portfolio that is associated with a price movement within a given probability over a specific period of time  known as value at risk 
through the use of derivative financial instruments  esi believes it manages its value at risk to acceptable levels see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for more information about value at risk 
operational risk is the risk related to execution of transactions  forecasting  scheduling  or other operational activities and is common to all companies participating in the energy marketing industry 
esi s continued investment in system infrastructure  business process improvement  employee training  and internal controls have helped mitigate operational risk to date 
liquidity risk is risk that has historically been less applicable to esi than many industry participants because of the financial support provided by wps resources in the form of guarantees to counterparties 
a significant downgrade in wps resources credit ratings  however  could cause counterparties to demand additional assurances of payment 
wps resources board of directors imposes restrictions on the amount of guarantees wps resources is allowed to provide to these counterparties in order to manage this risk 
esi believes it would have adequate capital to continue core operations unless wps resources credit ratings fall below investment grade standard poor s rating of bbb and moody s rating of baa 
the other category of risk mentioned above that esi faces is credit risk from retail and wholesale counterparties 
in order to mitigate its exposure to credit risk  esi developed credit policies 
as a result of these credit policies  esi has not experienced significant write offs from its large wholesale counterparties to date 
write offs pertaining to retail customers were million in and  and million  in esi believes its write off percentage is within the range experienced by similar energy companies 
the table below summarizes wholesale counterparty credit exposure  categorized by maturity date  as of december  in millions 
at december   esi had net exposure with three investment grade counterparties that were more than of total exposure 
total exposure with these counterparties was million and is included in the table below 
counterparty rating millions exposure exposure less than year exposure to years exposure to years investment grade regulated utility investment grade other non investment grade regulated utility non investment grade other non rated regulated utility non rated other total exposure the investment and non investment grade categories are determined by publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty or the rating of any guarantor  whichever is higher 
investment grade counterparties are those with a senior unsecured moody s rating of baa or above or a standard poor s rating of bbb or above 
exposure considers netting of accounts receivable and accounts payable where netting agreements are in place as well as netting mark to market exposure 
exposure is before consideration of collateral from counterparties 
collateral  in the form of cash and letters of credit  received from counterparties totaled million at december   million from investment grade counterparties and million from non rated counterparties 
non rated counterparties include stand alone companies  as well as unrated subsidiaries of rated companies without parental credit support 
these counterparties are subject to an internal credit review process 
esi  through a subsidiary eco coal pelletization llc  also owns an interest in a synthetic fuel producing facility 
see other future considerations  within the liquidity section below for more information on the risks related to esi s investment in this synthetic fuel operation 
esi is subject to clean air regulations enforced by the epa and state and local governments 
new legislation could require significant capital outlays 
see note commitments and contingencies  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on esi s environmental exposure 
results of operations wps resources compared with wps resources overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share the billion increase in consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily related to a billion increase in revenue at esi  driven by a increase in the average price of natural gas  higher natural gas throughput volumes in canada  and an increase in structured natural gas transactions with wholesale customers 
electric utility revenue increased approximately million  largely due to an approved electric rate increase for wpsc s wisconsin retail customers and an increase in electric sales volumes 
natural gas utility revenue increased approximately million  primarily as a result of an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  a natural gas rate increase  and higher natural gas throughput volumes 
income available for common shareholders was million basic earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million basic earnings per share for the year ended december  significant factors impacting the change in earnings and earnings per share are as follows and are discussed in more detail below esi s earnings increased million  for the year ended december   compared to higher earnings were driven by an million increase in margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses  a million decrease in miscellaneous income  a million decrease in section federal tax credits  and the negative impact of a million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle recorded in esi s earnings were also negatively impacted by an million pre tax impairment loss that was required to write down sunbury s long lived assets to fair market value and the recognition of million in interest expense related to the termination of sunbury s interest rate swap 
however  these losses were substantially offset by an million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances 
earnings at the holding company and other segment decreased million in  compared to  driven by lower gains from land sales  an income tax benefit recognized in from the donation of land to the wdnr  and an increase in interest expense 
these items were partially offset by higher equity earnings from our investment in atc 
electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to electric utility earnings were negatively impacted by fuel and purchased power costs that were million in excess of what wpsc was allowed to recover from customers due to inefficiencies in the fuel recovery process million related to retail customers and million related to wholesale customers 
in addition  the pscw s ruling in the rate case  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee nuclear plant outage and a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets 
gas utility earnings for the year ended december  decreased million  primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense incurred by the gas utility 
the change in basic earnings per share was also impacted by an increase of million shares in the weighted average number of outstanding shares of wps resources common stock for the year ended december   compared to the same period in additional shares were issued in under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans 
wps resources issuance of million additional shares of common stock through a public offering in november also contributed to the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
overview of utility operations utility operations include the electric utility segment  consisting of the electric operations of wpsc and uppco  and the gas utility segment comprising the natural gas operations of wpsc 
income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  electric utility segment operations wps resources electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to an approved electric rate increase for wpsc s wisconsin retail customers and an increase in electric sales volumes 
on december   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was required primarily to recover increased costs related to fuel and purchased power  the construction of the weston power plant  and benefit costs 
electric sales volumes increased  primarily due to significantly warmer weather during the cooling season  compared to the same period in  and new power sales agreements that were entered into with wholesale customers 
as a result of the warm weather  both wpsc and uppco set all time records for peak electric demand in the second and third quarters of the electric utility margin decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in margin can be attributed to a million decrease in wpsc s electric margin  which was largely driven by the sale of kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement 
prior to the sale of kewaunee  only nuclear fuel expense was reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
subsequent to the sale  all payments to dominion for power purchased from kewaunee are reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
these include both variable payments for energy delivered and fixed payments 
as a result of the sale  wpsc no longer incurs operating and maintenance expense  depreciation and decommissioning expense  or interest expense for kewaunee 
excluding the million of fixed payments made to dominion in  wpsc s electric utility margin increased million compared to excluding the fixed payments  the increase in margin was primarily related to the approved retail electric rate increase discussed above and the warm summer weather conditions  partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs associated with high natural gas prices and the pscw s disallowance of certain costs in its decision on the rate case for wpsc these costs were previously approved for deferral 
fuel and purchased power costs incurred in exceeded the amount recovered from ratepayers by million of which million related to wisconsin retail customers and million related to wholesale customers  negatively impacting margin 
the increase in fuel and purchased power costs resulted primarily from the destruction of certain natural gas production facilities in the gulf of mexico by hurricanes in the third quarter of  driving up the per unit cost of natural gas used in generation 
the quantity of power generated from wpsc s natural gas fired units was also up over the prior year  driven by the warm summer weather conditions experienced during  increased dispatch by the miso for reliability purposes  and purchases through a purchase power agreement from the fox energy center which began operating in june 
certain costs related to the miso were approved for deferral 
authorization was requested from the pscw to defer increased natural gas costs related to the hurricanes  but this request was denied  leaving the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism as the only option for recovery 
however  because of the way the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism works  the increase in fuel and purchased power costs primarily related to the combination of rising natural gas prices caused by the hurricanes and the increase in natural gas fired generation were essentially unrecoverable since they were incurred late in the year 
to mitigate the risk of unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its risk policy approved by the pscw  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of million of increased fuel and purchased power costs related to an extended outage at kewaunee in  resulting in this deferral being written off in the fourth quarter of electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in earnings resulted from the high fuel and purchased power costs that wpsc was unable to recover from its wisconsin retail and wholesale customers  the pscw s disallowance of previously deferred costs related to kewaunee  and an increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility segment operations wps resources gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchased gas costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to gas utility revenue increased primarily as a result of an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  a natural gas rate increase  and higher natural gas throughput volumes 
natural gas costs increased on a per unit basis for the year ended december   compared to following regulatory practice  wpsc passes changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the pscw and the mpsc 
the pscw issued an order authorizing a natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and the cost of natural gas distribution system improvements 
natural gas throughput volumes increased  driven by an increase in interdepartmental sales from the natural gas utility to the electric utility as a result of increased generation from combustion turbines 
higher natural gas throughput volumes from interdepartmental sales to the electric utility were partially offset by lower natural gas throughput volumes to residential customers  driven by milder weather conditions in  compared to wpsc also believes customers are taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices 
the natural gas utility margin increased million for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin was largely due to the rate increase mentioned above 
the increase in interdepartmental sales volumes to wpsc s electric utility also had a positive impact on the natural gas margin 
gas utility earnings for the year ended december   decreased million  primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense incurred by the gas utility 
overview of esi operations esi offers nonregulated natural gas  electric  and alternative fuel supplies  as well as energy management and consulting services  to retail and wholesale customers 
esi also owns several merchant electric generation plants  primarily in the midwest and northeastern united states and adjacent portions of canada 
prior to the fourth quarter of  wps resources reported two nonregulated segments  esi and pdi 
in the fourth quarter of  wps resources chief executive officer and its board of directors decided to view esi and pdi as one business  and corresponding changes were made to the segment information reported to them 
the change in reportable segments is the culmination of changes over the past two years that caused these businesses to become integrated 
these changes included combining the management teams  restructuring the ownership structure of esi and pdi  and having esi optimize the value of pdi s merchant generation fleet and reduce market price risk through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as futures  options  and swaps 
effective in the fourth quarter of  wps resources began reporting one nonregulated segment  esi 
segment information related to prior periods has been reclassified to reflect this change 
income available for common shareholders attributable to esi was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  esi s segment operations millions except natural gas sales volumes change nonregulated revenues nonregulated cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power margins wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours represents gross physical volumes revenues esi s revenue increased billion for the year ended december   compared to natural gas revenue increased billion  driven by a increase in the average price of natural gas  higher natural gas throughput volumes in canada  and an increase in structured natural gas transactions with wholesale customers 
electric revenue increased approximately million  largely due to an million increase in revenue from retail electric operations in new york  resulting from an increase in the per unit price of electricity sold and a increase in sales volumes the new york business had its first full year of operation in 
revenue at esi s sunbury generation facility sunbury increased million  due to improved opportunities to sell power into the market made possible by the expiration of a fixed price outtake contract on december   and higher energy market prices 
revenue also increased due to an increase in structured energy transactions 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in wholesale electric revenue related to esi s prior participation in the new jersey basic generation services program  which ended on may   and a million decrease in revenue from retail electric operations in michigan  driven by lower sales volumes in margins esi s margins increased million  from million for the year ended december   to million for many items contributed to the year over year net increase in margin and  as a result  a table has been provided to summarize significant changes 
variances included under other significant items in the table below are related to the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles and gains and losses that do not frequently occur in esi s business 
all variances depicted in the table are discussed in more detail below 
millions except natural gas sales volumes increase decrease in margin in compared to electric and other margins sunbury generation physical asset management new york retail michigan retail all other electric operations other significant items oil option activity  net liquidation of electric purchase contract net increase in electric and other margins natural gas margins gas margins principally canada  michigan  and wisconsin retail markets other significant items counterparty settlement unrealized gain on ohio options spot to forward differential net increase in natural gas margins net increase in esi margin esi s electric and other margins increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the net change in esi s electric and other margins sunbury generation the margin at sunbury increased million  primarily due to improved opportunities to sell power into the market as discussed in revenues above 
physical asset management optimization strategies related to esi s generation facilities resulted in a million increase in margin 
the profitability and volume of transactions related to esi s optimization strategies were higher due to increased variability in the price of energy in compared to in the first quarter of  esi first implemented the portfolio optimization strategies to optimize the value of the merchant generation fleet to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from these assets through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts and options 
new york retail the first full year of retail electric operations in new york as discussed in revenues above contributed million to the overall margin increase 
michigan retail the margin contributed by retail electric operations in michigan decreased million in  compared to higher transmission related charges resulting from the seams elimination charge adjustment  which was implemented on december   and continues through march  as ordered by the ferc  have negatively impacted the margin from retail electric operations in michigan 
in addition  tariff changes granted to the regulated utilities in michigan in  coupled with high wholesale energy prices  have significantly lowered the savings customers can obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
the tariff changes enable michigan utilities to charge a fee to electric customers choosing non utility suppliers in order to recover certain stranded costs 
esi has experienced significant customer attrition as a result of the tariff changes and higher wholesale prices 
customer attrition  high wholesale energy prices  and the tariff changes have also negatively impacted the margin from retail electric operations in michigan 
all other electric operations a million increase in margin was primarily related to realized and unrealized gains on structured power transactions in the latter half of these transactions included the execution of purchase and sales contracts with municipalities  merchant generators  retail aggregators  and other power marketers made possible by changing market conditions 
additionally  esi experienced increased margins from its merchant generation fleet as a result of increased dispatch levels due to improved market conditions 
period by period variability in the margin contributed by structured transactions and the merchant generation fleet is expected due to constantly changing market conditions and the timing of gain and loss recognition on certain transactions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
oil option activity  net mark to market gains recognized in on derivative instruments utilized to protect the value of a portion of esi s section federal tax credits in and contributed million to the increase in margin 
the derivative contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value are recorded currently in earnings 
this will result in mark to market gains being recognized in different periods  compared to any offsetting tax credit phase outs that may occur 
for the year ended december   unrealized mark to market gains of million and million were recognized for the and oil options  respectively  while no tax credit phase out was recognized because and tax credits will not be recognized until fuel is produced and sold in those periods 
hedges of exposure contributed an additional million increase in margin million gain on settlement  net of million of premium amortization 
liquidation of electric purchase contract in  an electricity supplier exiting the wholesale market in maine forced esi to liquidate a firm contract to buy power in and esi recognized a gain of million related to the liquidation of this contract  and entered into a new contract with another supplier for firm power in and to supply its customers in maine 
the cost to purchase power under the new contract will be more than the cost under the liquidated contract 
as a result  purchased power costs will be million higher in and slightly higher than the original contracted amount in  substantially offsetting the gain 
the natural gas margin at esi increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in esi s electric margin gas margins principally canada  michigan and wisconsin retail major contributors to growth in esi s gas margins include the continued expansion of our canadian retail and wholesale business  as well as increased margins from our retail operations in michigan and wisconsin 
counterparty settlement the natural gas margin increased million as a result of a favorable settlement with a counterparty 
unrealized gain on ohio options a million mark to market gain on options utilized to manage supply costs for ohio customers  which expire in varying months through september  also contributed to the margin increase 
these contracts are utilized to reduce the risk of price movements and changes in load requirements during customer signup periods 
earnings volatility results from the application of derivative accounting rules to the options requiring that these derivative instruments be marked to market  without a corresponding offset related to the customer contracts 
full requirements gas contracts with esi s customers are not considered derivatives and  therefore  no gain or loss is recognized on these contracts until settlement 
spot to forward differential the natural gas storage cycle described in more detail below accounted for a million decrease in the wholesale natural gas margin for the year ended december   the natural gas storage cycle had a million negative impact on margin  compared with a million favorable impact on margin for the same period in 
esi experiences earnings volatility associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs annually from april through march of the next year 
generally  injections of natural gas into storage inventory take place in the summer months and natural gas is withdrawn from storage in the winter months 
esi s policy is to hedge the value of natural gas storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets  effectively locking in a margin on the natural gas in storage 
however  fair market value hedge accounting rules require the natural gas in storage to be marked to market using spot prices  while the future sales contracts are marked to market using forward prices 
when the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price of natural gas  esi experiences volatility in its earnings 
consequently  earnings volatility may occur within the contract period for natural gas in storage 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
at december   there was a million difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts net unrealized loss  related to the natural gas storage cycle 
this difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts related to the storage cycle is expected to vary with market conditions  but will reverse entirely and have a positive impact on earnings when all of the natural gas is withdrawn from storage 
earnings esi s earnings increased million  for the year ended december   compared to higher earnings were driven by the million increase in margin  partially offset by a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses  a million decrease in miscellaneous income  a million decrease in section federal tax credits  and the negative impact of a million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle recorded in esi s earnings were also negatively impacted by an million pre tax impairment loss that was required to write down sunbury s long lived assets to fair market value and the recognition of million in interest expense related to the termination of sunbury s interest rate swap 
however  these losses were substantially offset by an million pre tax gain recognized on the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances 
overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations include the operations of wps resources and the nonutility activities at wpsc and uppco 
holding company and other operations recognized earnings of million during the year ended december   compared to earnings of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily due to a million decrease in pre tax gains related to land sales  an income tax benefit recognized in from the donation of land to the wdnr  and a million increase in interest expense 
pre tax land sale gains of million were recognized in  compared to million of pre tax land sale gains in interest expense increased primarily as a result of restructuring sunbury s debt to a wps resources obligation in june and higher average short term debt in  compared to partially offsetting the items discussed above was a million increase in pre tax equity earnings from atc and million of deferred financing costs that were written off in the first quarter of pre tax equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in wps resources ownership interest in atc increased from approximately at december   to approximately at december  the higher ownership interest was primarily the result of wps resources continued funding of a portion of the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line 
operating expenses wps resources operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense gain on sale of emission allowances impairment loss taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to utility operating and maintenance expenses increased million  primarily as a result of a million increase in wpsc s operating and maintenance expenses 
the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc the combined increase in pension expense  active and postretirement medical expense  salaries  and customer service expense was approximately million 
transmission related expenses increased million 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw concluded that only half of the loss related to the sale of kewaunee could be collected from ratepayers 
as a result  wpsc wrote off million of the regulatory asset established for the loss on the sale of kewaunee 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw also disallowed recovery of increased operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  resulting in a million write off of previously deferred costs 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately million related to kewaunee  due to the sale of this facility on july  operating and maintenance expenses at esi increased million 
approximately million of the increase related to higher payroll and benefit costs associated with recent business expansion 
commissions paid to brokers and third party agents increased million and bad debt expense increased million  primarily as a result of higher energy prices 
operating and maintenance expenses at sunbury also increased million 
maintenance activities were performed in to better ensure the plant s ability to capitalize on high market prices 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to  largely due to an increase of million at wpsc 
the increase at wpsc was driven by higher gains on decommissioning trust assets prior to the sale of kewaunee of approximately million 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets included as a component of miscellaneous income offset the increased decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice 
continued capital investment at wpsc also resulted in an increase in depreciation expense 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation resulting from the sale of the kewaunee assets in july gain on sale of emission allowances esi completed the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances in may the sales proceeds were million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
esi also sold other emission allowances throughout the year  recognizing a gain on these additional sales of million 
impairment loss the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances in may provides esi with more time to evaluate various options related to sunbury 
these options range from closing the plant  retaining the plant and operating it during favorable economic periods  or a future sale 
because esi is no longer committed to the sale of sunbury as its only option  generally accepted accounting principles require all long lived assets that were previously classified as held for sale to be reclassified as held and used at the lower of their carrying value before they were classified as held for sale  adjusted for depreciation that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used  or fair value at the date the held for sale criteria was no longer met 
upon reclassification of the sunbury plant and related assets as held and used in the second quarter of  esi recorded a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge reflects the reduction in the fair value of the sunbury plant without the related emission allowances 
other income expense wps resources other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense minority interest other expense income miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the largest contributors to the change in miscellaneous income approximately million of the increase in miscellaneous income related to realized gains on nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in the second quarter of in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee  which was completed on july  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to the realized gains was offset by an increase in decommissioning expense 
overall  the change in the investment strategy for the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets had no impact on income available for common shareholders 
pre tax equity earnings from wps resources investment in atc increased million 
pre tax equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in wpsc sold a interest in the weston power plant to dpc in the fourth quarter of proceeds received from the sale included reimbursement for approximately million of carrying costs incurred by wpsc for capital expenditures related to dpc s portion of the facility  which were funded by wpsc in and the million reimbursement was recorded as miscellaneous income in land sale gains of million were recognized in  compared to land sale gains of million in  resulting in a million decrease in miscellaneous income 
other income at esi decreased million  primarily related to a million termination payment received from duquesne power in december as a result of duquesne s termination of the former asset purchase agreement for sunbury 
interest expense interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the increase in interest expense was primarily related to terminating the interest rate swap pertaining to sunbury s non recourse debt obligation in the second quarter of the interest rate swap was previously designated as a cash flow hedge and  as a result  the mark to market losses had been recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
wps resources is required to recognize the amount accumulated within other comprehensive income as a component of interest expense when the hedged transactions future interest payments on the sunbury debt obligation are no longer probable of occurring 
as a result  the restructuring of the sunbury non recourse debt to a wps resources obligation in june triggered the recognition of million of interest expense related to the mark to market value of the swap at the date of restructuring 
the remaining increase in interest expense was primarily related to an increase in the average level of short term debt outstanding in  compared to provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a increase in income before taxes  while section federal tax credits recognized decreased million 
other factors contributing to the increase in the effective tax rate in  compared to  were a tax benefit recorded in for land donated to the wdnr  and a million increase in the year over year provision for income taxes related to favorable settlements of certain tax audits and refund claims in our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in recognizing the tax benefit of section federal tax credits totaling million in and million in cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies when companies are required to recognize conditional legal asset retirement obligations that result from the acquisition  construction  and normal operation of a long lived asset 
because the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations has been interpreted differently between companies  sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  had been inconsistently applied in practice 
the adoption of interpretation no 
at esi on december   resulted in a negative million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  related to recording a liability for asbestos remediation at certain of esi s generation plants 
for the utility segments of wps resources  we concluded it was probable that any differences between expenses under interpretation no 
and expenses currently recovered through customer rates will be recoverable in future customer rates 
accordingly  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the utility segments income 
compared with wps resources overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following table wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues income available for common shareholders basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share the million increase in consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was largely driven by a million  increase in revenue at esi and an million  increase in electric utility revenue 
higher natural gas prices  portfolio optimization strategies implemented in  and expansion of the canadian retail natural gas business were the primary contributors to increased revenue at esi 
higher electric utility revenue was primarily the result of authorized retail electric rate increases for wpsc s wisconsin and michigan customers 
revenue changes by reportable segment are discussed in more detail below 
income available for common shareholders was million basic earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million basic earnings per share for the year ended december  significant factors impacting the change in earnings and earnings per share are as follows and are discussed in more detail below 
approved rate increases including the impact of timely retail electric rate relief in  compared to the delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in favorably impacted year over year margin at the utilities 
natural gas utility throughput volumes were lower in due to weather that was warmer during the heating season  compared to higher throughput volumes and improved supply management in ohio favorably impacted esi s year over year retail natural gas margin 
portfolio optimization strategies  better management of retail electric operations in ohio and positive operating results from advantage energy contributed to improved year over year electric margins at esi 
as part of our overall asset management strategy  wps resources realized earnings of million from the sale and donation of land in  compared to million in earnings from equity method investments primarily from atc increased in  compared to earnings were negatively impacted by higher operating and maintenance expenses in synthetic fuel related tax credits recognized were higher in when compared to the weighted average number of shares of wps resources common stock increased by million shares for the year ended december   compared to the same period in the increase was largely due to issuing  additional shares of common stock through a public offering in november additional shares were also issued under the stock investment plan and certain stock based employee benefit plans 
overview of utility operations income available for common shareholders attributable to the electric utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income available for common shareholders attributable to the gas utility segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  electric utility segment operations wps resources electric utility segment results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to authorized retail and wholesale electric rate increases for wpsc s wisconsin and michigan customers as summarized below to recover higher fuel and purchased power costs  increased operating expenses  and expenditures incurred for infrastructure improvements 
effective march   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million 
effective may   the ferc approved a million  interim increase in wholesale electric rates 
effective july   the mpsc approved a million  increase in retail electric rates for wpsc s michigan customers and authorized recovery of million of increased transmission costs through the power supply cost recovery process 
effective january   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million 
electric utility sales volumes were also slightly higher in  increasing over sales volumes 
a increase in sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes to residential customers 
higher sales volumes to our commercial and industrial customers reflect an improving economy and growth within our service area  while the decrease in sales volumes to residential customers reflects weather that was cooler during the cooling season  compared to the electric utility margin increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the majority of this increase can be attributed to a million  increase in wpsc s electric margin 
the increase in wpsc s electric margin is primarily related to the retail and wholesale electric rate increases  partially offset by a million increase in purchased power costs 
the quantity of power purchased in increased over purchases  and purchased power costs were higher on a per unit basis in  compared to the pscw  in  allowed wpsc to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs were in excess of plus or minus from approved levels 
in response to a request for additional fuel cost recovery filed early in  wpsc was allowed to recover million of its increased fuel and purchased power costs during the pscw also allowed wpsc to defer million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly associated with the extension of the kewaunee refueling outage in the fourth quarter of the kewaunee outage was extended three weeks due primarily to an unexpected problem encountered with equipment used for lifting internal vessel components to perform a required ten year in service inspection 
it was anticipated that these costs would be recovered in  however  in the pscw s final decision allowing wpsc authority to increase retail electric and natural gas rates in  the pscw determined wpsc could not recover the costs for the extended outage 
for more information on this determination  see note  regulatory environment  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
electric utility earnings increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the increased earnings were largely driven by the higher margin at wpsc including the effect of timely retail electric rate relief in compared to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in  partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility segment operations wps resources gas utility segment results millions change revenues purchased gas costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million  for the year ended december   compared to higher revenue was driven by an authorized rate increase and an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  partially offset by an overall decrease in natural gas throughput volumes 
the pscw issued a final order authorizing a retail natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  natural gas prices increased per unit in higher natural gas prices reflect higher marketplace natural gas costs in the pscw and the mpsc allow wpsc to pass changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers 
as a result  changes in the price of the natural gas commodity do not have a direct impact on wpsc s margin 
the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by weather that was warmer during the heating season for the year ended december   compared to the natural gas utility margin increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin is largely due to the authorized rate increase mentioned above 
the ability of wpsc to realize the full benefit of an authorized rate increase is dependent upon normal throughput volumes  therefore  the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes negatively impacted wpsc s ability to benefit from the full amount of the rate increase 
the higher margin drove a million  increase in natural gas utility earnings for the year ended december  overview of esi operations income available for common shareholders attributable to esi was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in income available for common shareholders resulted from higher overall margins  an increase in the amount of tax credits recognized  and a million termination payment received from duquesne power in december  as a result of duquesne s termination of the asset sale agreement with sunbury 
these items were offset by an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and a million after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principles that was recorded in esi s segment operations millions except natural gas sales volumes change nonregulated revenues nonregulated cost of fuel  natural gas  and purchased power margins wholesale natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet retail natural gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet wholesale electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours retail electric sales volumes in kilowatt hours represents gross physical volumes natural gas revenues increased million  driven by higher natural gas prices and the expansion of the canadian retail natural gas business as a result of obtaining new customers  partially offset by lower sales volumes from physical wholesale transactions 
sales volumes from physical wholesale transactions declined as a result of reduced price volatility of natural gas during the first half of volatility provides more opportunity for profitable physical wholesale transactions 
electric and other revenues increased million  largely due to higher volumes from portfolio optimization strategies resulting in an million increase in revenue 
in the first quarter of  esi first implemented the portfolio optimization strategies to optimize the value of its merchant generation fleet and its retail supply portfolios to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from these assets through the use of various financial and physical instruments such as forward contracts and options 
electric revenue also increased as a result of the july   acquisition of advantage energy and higher energy prices compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue recognized at sunbury 
the decrease in revenue from sunbury was driven by fewer opportunities to sell power into the spot market 
the natural gas margin at esi increased million for the year ended december   compared to the margin related to retail natural gas operations increased million  primarily driven by higher natural gas throughput volumes in ohio driven by the addition of new customers  operational improvements  and better management of supply for residential and small commercial customers 
customer growth in canada also contributed to the increase in the retail natural gas margin 
the margin attributed to wholesale natural gas operations increased million 
the increase in wholesale natural gas margin was driven by a million margin increase related to the natural gas storage cycle  a million increase in the canadian wholesale natural gas margin  and increased margins from other structured wholesale natural gas transactions 
favorable settlements of liabilities with several counterparties in in the amount of million largely offset these increases in the wholesale natural gas margin 
for the year ended december   the natural gas storage cycle had a million positive impact on margin  compared with a million negative impact on margin for the same period in at december   there was a million difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts net unrealized loss  related to the natural gas storage cycle 
this difference between the market value of natural gas in storage and the market value of future sales contracts related to the storage cycle is expected to vary with market conditions  but will reverse entirely and have a positive impact on earnings when all of the natural gas is withdrawn from storage 
the increase in the canadian wholesale natural gas margin is related to higher volumes more structured wholesale transactions as esi continued to increase its wholesale natural gas operations in this region 
the remaining million increase in margin at esi was driven by an increase in the electric and other margin 
the higher margin was driven by a million increase from portfolio optimization strategies discussed above and a million increase in margin related to retail electric operations in ohio  which can be attributed to better management of retail operations and improved supply procurement 
these items were partially offset by an million decrease in the margin related to sunbury and a million decrease in margin from esi no longer participating in the new jersey basic generation services program esi participated in this program from august until may  but higher margins were recognized in the summer months 
the lower margin at sunbury was largely due to an increase in the per ton cost of coal utilized in the generation process and by fewer opportunities to sell power into the spot market in  compared to overview of holding company and other segment operations holding company and other operations had income available for common shareholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this favorable variance can be attributed to an increase in earnings recognized from the sale of land located along the peshtigo river in wisconsin and an increase in equity earnings from atc and wisconsin river power company 
equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in wpsc nonutility operations recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of land located near the peshtigo river in the fourth quarter of  compared to a million pre tax gain that was recognized on the sale of land in the fourth quarter of wpsc also realized an income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of from the donation of land to the wdnr 
operating expenses wps resources operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense taxes other than income operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses increased million  for the year ended december   compared to utility operating and maintenance expenses increased million 
electric transmission and distribution costs were up million at the utilities primarily due to an increase in transmission rates 
pension and postretirement medical costs incurred at the utilities increased million 
additionally  million of the increase was driven by amortization of costs incurred in conjunction with the implementation of the automated meter reading system and the purchase of the de pere energy center previously deferred as regulatory assets 
maintenance expenses at wpsc s coal fired generation facilities were million higher in  compared to  driven by an extension of the annual planned outage at the pulliam generation facility in higher payroll and other benefit costs also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the fall refueling outage at kewaunee did not significantly impact the year over year change in operating and maintenance expenses as there was also a refueling outage at kewaunee in spring  and the pscw approved the deferral of incremental operating and maintenance expenses that were incurred as a direct result of the refueling outage extension million of operating and maintenance expenses were deferred in the fourth quarter of 
it was anticipated that these costs would be recovered in  however  in the pscw s final decision allowing wpsc authority to increase retail electric and natural gas rates in  the pscw determined wpsc could not recover the costs for the extended outage 
for more information on this determination  see note  regulatory environment  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses at esi increased million mostly due to higher payroll  benefits  and other costs associated with continued business expansion 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased million  for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to a decrease of million resulting from lower realized gains on decommissioning trust assets and because the decommissioning trust was not funded in in anticipation of selling kewaunee 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets are substantially offset by depreciation expense pursuant to regulatory practice see detailed discussion in miscellaneous income below 
an increase in depreciation expense from plant asset additions at wpsc partially offset the decrease in decommissioning expense 
other income expense wps resources other income expense millions change miscellaneous income interest expense and distributions of preferred securities minority interest other expense income miscellaneous income miscellaneous income decreased million  for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in miscellaneous income is largely due to a decrease in realized gains on decommissioning trust assets of million 
there were significant realized gains recognized on decommissioning trust assets in the fourth quarter of  which were driven by a change in the investment strategy for wpsc s qualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets 
qualified decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee 
pursuant to regulatory practice  realized gains on decommissioning trust assets are substantially offset by depreciation expense 
a million write off of previously deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of our trust preferred securities in the first quarter of also unfavorably impacted miscellaneous income 
partially offsetting the decreases discussed above were an million increase in equity earnings from investments  a million increase in income recognized from the sale of land located along the peshtigo river in wisconsin discussed previously  a million termination payment received from duquesne power in december as a result of duquesne s termination of the asset sale agreement for sunbury  and a combined million increase related to higher royalties and a decrease in operating losses realized from esi s investment in a synthetic fuel producing facility 
the increase in equity earnings was primarily related to our investments in atc  wisconsin river power company  and wisconsin valley improvement company 
equity earnings from atc were million in  compared to million in royalty income recognized from the synthetic fuel facility increased as a result of higher production levels at this facility 
minority interest the decrease in minority interest is related to the fact that esi s partner in its subsidiary  eco coal pelletization llc  was allocated more production from the synthetic fuel operation in compared to esi s partner was not allocated any production from the synthetic fuel facility in the first quarter of as they requested additional production in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by tax deductions pertaining to items that exceed the related book expense including land donated to the wdnr in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a million decrease in the provision for income taxes compared to  and a million increase in the amount of tax credits recognized in related to an increase in synthetic fuel tax credits produced in and the favorable settlement of several tax audits and refund claims related to prior tax years 
our ownership interest in the synthetic fuel operation resulted in the recognition of million of section federal tax credits for the year ended december   and million of tax credits for the increase in synthetic fuel related tax credits was primarily due to an increase in tax credits produced and allocable to esi  an increase in the value of the credits produced resulting from the higher btu content of coal and the annual inflation adjustment allowed  and the favorable settlement of several tax audits and refund claims related to prior tax years 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles on january   wps resources recorded a positive after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million primarily related to the operations of esi to income available for common shareholders as a net result of removing from its balance sheet the mark to market effects of contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative 
this change in accounting resulted from the decision of the emerging issues task force to preclude mark to market accounting for energy contracts that are not derivatives 
the required change in accounting had no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows of the contracts 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  at esi resulted in a million negative after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of  related to recording a liability for the closure of an ash basin at sunbury 
balance sheet wps resources compared with accounts receivable increased million  from million at december   to  million at december  accounts receivable at esi increased million  largely driven by a increase in the average price of natural gas experienced in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of a increase in natural gas volumes at esi in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable at the regulated utilities increased million  largely due to a per unit increase in natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of an increase in retail electric rates combined with an increase in electric sales volumes in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable at the regulated utilities 
inventories increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in inventories was primarily related to an million increase in natural gas in storage at esi and a million increase in natural gas in storage at wpsc 
higher natural gas prices and a increase in natural gas volumes in storage at esi drove the increase in inventory at esi 
volatility in the price of natural gas in the latter half of resulted in more natural gas storage opportunities  which drove the volume increase at esi 
the average per unit price of natural gas purchased by wpsc increased in  compared to  driving the increase in natural gas in storage at wpsc 
current assets from risk management activities increased million  at december   compared to december   and current liabilities from risk management activities increased million 
long term assets from risk management activities increased million  at december   compared to december   and long term liabilities from risk management activities increased million 
the increase in short term and long term risk management assets and liabilities was primarily related to increases in the forward price of natural gas and electricity 
esi also had more wholesale electric volumes under contract at december   compared to december  property  plant  and equipment  net  decreased million to  million at december   compared to  million at december  the major contributors to the change in property  plant  and equipment are summarized below kewaunee was sold in  driving a million decrease in property  plant  and equipment 
depreciation expense of million was recorded in wpsc sold a interest in weston  contributing an million decrease to property  plant  and equipment 
an impairment charge was recorded at sunbury  contributing a million decrease to property  plant  and equipment 
substantially offsetting these decreases  capital expenditures recorded in were million  primarily related to the construction of weston nuclear decommissioning trusts decreased from million at december  to at december  the qualified decommissioning trust assets were sold along with the other kewaunee assets see note  acquisitions and sales of assets  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information and the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets were liquidated in connection with the kewaunee sale 
regulatory assets increased million  from million at december   to million at december   largely due to million of costs that were deferred related to the unplanned outage at kewaunee in  a million increase in the regulatory asset related to the minimum pension liability  deferral of million of miso charges  and a million deferral of a portion of the loss on the sale of kewaunee 
other assets increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the increase in other assets was driven by a million increase in wps resources investment in atc 
accounts payable increased million  from million at december   to  million at december  accounts payable at esi increased million  largely driven by the increase in the average price of natural gas experienced in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of natural gas volumes at esi also increased in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of accounts payable at the utilities increased million  driven primarily by higher per unit natural gas costs and higher per unit fuel and purchased power costs in  compared to other current liabilities increased million  from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to an accrued pension contribution of million recorded at december  accrued employee benefits and wages and customer prepayments also increased at december   compared to december  regulatory liabilities increased million  from million at december   to million at december   driven by a million regulatory liability related to proceeds received from the liquidation of the nonqualified decommissioning trust in connection with the kewaunee sale 
the regulatory liability related to mark to market gains on derivative instruments also increased million  primarily related to mark to market gains recorded on financial transmission rights related to our participation in miso 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the regulatory liability pertaining to the asset retirement obligation recorded related to the decommissioning of kewaunee as this plant was sold on july   and a million reduction in deferred unrealized gains on decommissioning trust assets as the decommissioning trust assets were either liquidated or transferred in the sale of kewaunee 
asset retirement obligations decreased from million at december   to million at december   driven by the termination of our obligation to decommission kewaunee as this plant was sold on july  liquidity and capital resources wps resources we believe that our cash balances  liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity made available because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies 
currently  we believe our ratings are among the best in the energy industry see financing cash flows credit ratings below 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the decrease was driven by a million increase in cash required to fund working capital requirements  primarily at esi 
net cash provided by operating activities also decreased due to various expenditures incurred in at wpsc  which will not be collected from ratepayers until future years 
in  expenditures incurred related to the unplanned kewaunee outage were approximately million  expenditures incurred related to miso were approximately million  and increased costs related to coal shortages were approximately million see note  regulatory environment  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these regulatory assets 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the increase was driven by operating activities at esi and wpsc 
in  operating activities at esi used cash due primarily to increasing working capital requirements resulting from business growth and natural gas storage opportunities near the end of the year 
esi s natural gas operations did not experience the same level of growth in compared to  and storage opportunities were similar at the end of both years  which enabled esi to generate additional operating cash flow in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities at wpsc was driven by improved operating results 
investing cash flows net cash used in investing activities decreased million  from million in to million in the decrease was driven by proceeds of million received from the liquidation of the non qualified decommissioning trust in connection with the kewaunee sale  million of proceeds received from the sale of kewaunee  million of proceeds received from the sale of sunbury s emission allowances in  and million of proceeds received from dpc upon closing of the sale of a ownership interest in weston the decreases were partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures primarily related to the construction of weston  purchases of emission allowances of million primarily related to operations at sunbury  and a million increase in the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions  driven by a million increase in wps resources funding of atc s wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line in  compared to net cash used for investing activities was million in  compared to million in the increase was largely related to a million increase in utility capital expenditures see capital expenditures below  partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for the purchase of equity investments and other acquisitions

the proceeds to us were million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
the proceeds were used to reduce short term debt  and fund equity contributions to subsidiary companies 
in june  million of non recourse debt at an esi subsidiary that was used to finance the purchase of sunbury was restructured to a five year wps resources obligation in connection with the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances

credit ratings wps resources and wpsc use internally generated funds and commercial paper borrowing to satisfy most of their capital requirements 
wps resources also periodically issues long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
wps resources may seek nonrecourse financing for funding nonregulated acquisitions 
wps resources commercial paper borrowing program provides for working capital requirements of the nonregulated businesses and uppco 
wpsc has its own commercial paper borrowing program 
wpsc also periodically issues long term debt  receives equity contributions from wps resources  and makes payments for return of capital to wps resources to reduce short term debt  fund future growth  and maintain capitalization ratios as authorized by the pscw 
the specific forms of long term financing  amounts  and timing depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
the current credit ratings for wps resources and wpsc are listed in the table below 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wps resources senior unsecured debt commercial paper credit facility a a a p a wpsc senior secured debt preferred stock commercial paper credit facility a a a aa a p aa in september  standard poor s had placed all of wps resources and wpsc s credit ratings on creditwatch with negative implications as a result of wps resources announcement that it entered into a definitive agreement with aquila to acquire its natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota 
however  in january  standard poor s removed wps resources and wpsc from creditwatch and affirmed wps resources a corporate credit rating and a senior unsecured debt rating 
also  the corporate credit ratings of wpsc were affirmed at a and removed from creditwatch 
standard poor s stated that the consolidated ratings of wps resources reflected the strength and cash flow stability of its utility subsidiaries and the two relatively low risk natural gas utilities being acquired 
the outlook continues to be negative for wps resources and wpsc as the companies have several events that must be successfully completed before the companies performance can be considered stable 
wps resources must successfully complete the integration of the retail natural gas operations it is acquiring in michigan and minnesota and wpsc must complete the construction of weston on time and on budget 
in september  moody s announced no change to the current ratings as a result of wps resources announcement that it entered into a definitive agreement with aquila to acquire its natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  but changed the rating outlook for wps resources and wpsc from stable to negative  citing a potential risk that the company s leverage may increase over the next several years 
in january  standard poor s downgraded its ratings for wpsc one ratings level and established a negative outlook 
at the same time  standard poor s affirmed wps resources ratings but changed the outlook from stable to negative 
in taking these actions  standard poor s cited wpsc s substantial capital spending program and the risk profile of wps resources nonregulated businesses 
in november  moody s downgraded its long term ratings for wps resources and wpsc one ratings level  leaving only commercial paper ratings unchanged 
moody s downgrade of wps resources was based principally on a gradual shift in the company s financial and business risk profile attributable to the growth of nonregulated businesses  the impact of weaker wholesale power markets  and a relatively high dividend payout 
moody s downgrade of wpsc was based on the expectation that the utility s substantial capital spending program will exceed its retained cash flow through  which is likely to lead to a meaningful increase in debt 
following the downgrade  moody s set the ratings outlook at stable for both wps resources and wpsc 
we believe these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry and allow us to access commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable terms 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  are subject to change  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
rating agencies use a number of both quantitative and qualitative measures in determining a company s credit rating 
these measures include business risk  liquidity risk  competitive position  capital mix  financial condition  predictability of cash flows  management strength  and future direction 
some of the quantitative measures can be analyzed through a few key financial ratios  while the qualitative ones are more subjective 
wps resources and wpsc hold credit lines to back of their commercial paper borrowing and letters of credit 
these credit facilities are based on a credit rating of a p for both wps resources and wpsc 
a significant decrease in the commercial paper credit ratings could adversely affect the companies by increasing the interest rates at which they can borrow and potentially limiting the availability of funds to the companies through the commercial paper market 
a restriction in the companies ability to use commercial paper borrowing to meet their working capital needs would require them to secure funds through alternate sources resulting in higher interest expense  higher credit line fees  and a potential delay in the availability of funds 
esi maintains underlying agreements to support its electric and natural gas trading operations 
in the event of a deterioration of wps resources credit rating  many of these agreements allow the counterparty to demand additional assurance of payment 
this provision could pertain to existing business  new business  or both with the counterparty 
the additional assurance requirements could be met with letters of credit  surety bonds  or cash deposits and would likely result in wps resources being required to maintain increased bank lines of credit or incur additional expenses  and could restrict the amount of business esi would be able to conduct 
esi uses the new york mercantile exchange nymex and over the counter financial markets to mitigate its exposure to physical customer obligations 
these contracts are closely correlated to the customer contracts  but price movements on the contracts may require financial backing 
certain movements in price for contracts through the nymex exchange require posting of cash deposits equal to the market move 
for the over the counter market  the underlying contract may allow the counterparty to require additional collateral to cover the net financial differential between the original contract price and the current forward market 
increased requirements related to market price changes usually only result in a temporary liquidity need that will unwind as the sales contracts are fulfilled 
future capital requirements and resources contractual obligations the following table summarizes the contractual obligations of wps resources  including its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations total payments due by period as of december  millions amounts committed and thereafter long term debt principal and interest payments operating leases commodity purchase obligations purchase orders capital contributions to equity method investment other total contractual cash obligations long term debt principal and interest payments represent bonds issued  notes issued  and loans made to wps resources and its subsidiaries 
we record all principal obligations on the balance sheet 
commodity purchase obligations represent mainly commodity purchase contracts of wps resources and its subsidiaries 
energy supply contracts at esi included as part of commodity purchase obligations are generally entered into to meet obligations to deliver energy to customers 
wpsc and uppco expect to recover the costs of their contracts in future customer rates 
purchase orders include obligations related to normal business operations and large construction obligations  including of weston obligations 
the sale of a interest in weston to dpc was completed in november  but wpsc retains the legal obligation to initially remit payment to third parties for of all construction costs incurred  of which will subsequently be billed to dpc 
capital contributions to equity method investment include our commitment to fund a portion of atc s wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line together with atc 
the table above does not reflect obligations under the definitive agreement with aquila to acquire its natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota  which are discussed in note  acquisitions and sales of assets  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
other mainly represents expected pension and postretirement funding obligations 
capital requirements wpsc makes large investments in capital assets 
net construction expenditures are expected to be million in the aggregate for the through period  not including obligations under the definitive agreement with aquila 
the largest of these expenditures is for the construction of weston wpsc is expected to incur costs of approximately million from through related to its ownership interest in this facility 
as part of its regulated utility operations  on september   wpsc submitted an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the pscw seeking approval to construct weston  a megawatt coal fired generation facility near wausau  wisconsin 
the facility is estimated to cost approximately million including the acquisition of coal trains  of which wpsc is responsible for slightly more than approximately million of the costs 
in november  dpc purchased a ownership interest in weston  remitting proceeds of million for its share of the construction costs including carrying charges as of the closing date of the sale 
wpsc is responsible for slightly more than of the costs because of certain common facilities that will be installed as part of the project 
wpsc will have a larger than interest in these common facilities 
dpc will be billed by wpsc for of all remaining costs to complete the construction of the plant 
as of december   wpsc has incurred a total cost of million related to its ownership interest in the project 
in addition to the costs discussed above  wpsc expects to incur additional construction costs through the date the plant goes into service of approximately million to fund construction of the transmission facilities required to support weston atc will reimburse wpsc for the construction costs of these transmission facilities and related carrying costs when weston becomes commercially operational  which is expected to occur in june other significant anticipated construction expenditures for wpsc during the three year period through include approximately million of electric distribution projects including replacement of utility poles  transformers  meters  etc  environmental projects of approximately million  other expenditures at wpsc generation plants to ensure continued reliability of these facilities of approximately million  and corporate services infrastructure projects of approximately million 
on april   the pscw approved wpsc s request to transfer its interest in the wausau  wisconsin  to duluth  minnesota  transmission line to atc 
wps resources committed to fund of total project costs incurred up to million 
wps resources will receive additional equity in atc in exchange for the project funding 
wps resources may terminate funding if the project extends beyond january  the total cost of the project is estimated at million and it is expected that the line will be completed and placed in service in wps resources has the right  but not the obligation  to provide additional funding in excess of million up to of the revised cost estimate 
however  wps resources future funding of the line will be reduced by the amount funded by allete  inc allete has exercised an option to fund a portion of wps resources commitment and is expected to fund million of the project cost in considering this  for the period through  wps resources expects to fund up to approximately million for its portion of the wausau to duluth transmission line 
wps resources expects to provide additional capital contributions to atc of approximately million for the period through for other projects 
uppco is expected to incur construction expenditures of about million in the aggregate for the period through  primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs and safety measures at hydroelectric facilities 
capital expenditures identified at esi for through are expected to be approximately million  largely due to scheduled major maintenance projects at esi s generation facilities  and computer equipment related to business expansion and normal technology upgrades 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly from the estimates depending on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  acquisition opportunities  market volatility  and economic trends 
other capital expenditures for wps resources and its subsidiaries for through could be significant depending on its success in pursuing development and acquisition opportunities 
when appropriate  wps resources may seek nonrecourse financing for a portion of the cost of these acquisitions 
capital resources as of december   both wps resources and wpsc were in compliance with all of the covenants under their lines of credit and other debt obligations 
for the period through  wps resources plans to use internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments  cash proceeds from asset sales  and debt and equity financings to fund capital requirements 
wps resources plans to maintain debt to equity ratios at appropriate levels to support current credit ratings and corporate growth 
management believes wps resources has adequate financial flexibility and resources to meet its future needs 
wps resources currently has the ability to issue up to million of debt and or equity under its existing shelf registration statement 
wpsc currently has the ability to issue up to an additional million of debt under its existing shelf registration statements 
the shelf registrations are subject to the ultimate terms and conditions to be determined prior to the actual issuance of specific securities 
in november  wps resources entered into two unsecured revolving credit agreements of million and million with jp morgan chase bank and banc of america securities llc 
these credit facilities are bridge facilities intended to backup commercial paper borrowings related to the purchase of the michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations from aquila and to support purchase price adjustments related to working capital at the time of the closing of the transactions 
the capacity under the bridge facilities will be reduced by the amount of proceeds from any long term financing we complete prior to closing  with the exception of proceeds from the november equity offering 
the credit agreements will be further reduced as permanent or replacement financing is secured 
under the million credit agreement  loans cannot exceed the purchase price adjustments in connection with the aquila acquisitions and no more than million can be borrowed at the time of the first acquisition 
under the million facility  these loan commitments will be reduced by one third days after the consummation of the applicable acquisition with the remaining two thirds due days after the consummation of the applicable acquisition or earlier if long term financing or replacement credit agreements are executed 
both of these credit agreements mature on september  these credit agreements have representations and covenants that are similar to those in our existing credit facilities 
in november  wps resources entered into a forward equity sale agreement with an affiliate of jp morgan securities  inc  as forward purchaser  relating to million shares of wps resources common stock 
in connection with the forward agreement  and at wps resources request  jp morgan securities borrowed an equal number of shares of wps resources common stock from stock lenders and sold the borrowed shares to the public 
subject to certain exceptions  wps resources has the right to elect physical or cash settlement of the forward sale agreement on a date or dates to be specified by wps resources within approximately one year of the date of the public offering 
wps resources expects to physically settle the forward agreement and use the proceeds to partially finance the proposed acquisition of the michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations from aquila and for general corporate purposes 
if the forward agreement would have been physically settled by delivery of shares at december   wps resources would have received million  based on the december   forward share price of per share for the million shares  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
see note  common equity  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on settlement methods 
the use of a forward agreement allowed wps resources to avoid market uncertainty by pricing a stock offering under then existing market conditions  while mitigating share dilution by postponing the issuance of stock until funds are needed 
in june  wps resources entered into an unsecured million year credit agreement 
this revolving credit line replaces the former day credit line facilities  which had a borrowing capacity of million 
wpsc also entered into a new year credit facility  for million  to replace its former day credit line facility for the same amount 
the credit lines are used to back of wps resources and wpsc s commercial paper borrowing programs and the majority of letters of credit for wps resources and wpsc 
as of december   there was a total of million and million available under wps resources and wpsc s credit lines  respectively 
other future considerations agreement to purchase aquila s michigan and minnesota natural gas distribution operations on september   wps resources  through wholly owned subsidiaries  entered into two definitive agreements with aquila to acquire its natural gas distribution operations in michigan and minnesota for approximately million  exclusive of direct costs of the acquisition 
the purchase price will increase for certain adjustments related to working capital  including accounts receivable  unbilled revenue  inventory  and certain other current assets 
the purchase price is also subject to other closing and post closing adjustments  primarily net plant adjustments 
the michigan natural gas assets provide natural gas distribution service to about  customers in cities and communities throughout otsego  grand haven  and monroe counties 
annual natural gas throughput for the michigan natural gas assets are approximately half those of the minnesota natural gas assets 
the assets operate under a cost of service environment and are currently allowed an return on equity on a equity component of the regulatory capital structure 
the minnesota natural gas assets provide natural gas distribution service to about  customers throughout the state in cities and communities including grand rapids  pine city  rochester  and dakota county 
annual natural gas throughput volumes have historically been just slightly less than throughput volumes experienced by wpsc s natural gas utility 
like michigan  the assets also operate under a cost of service environment and are currently allowed an return on equity on a equity component of the regulatory capital structure 
wps resources anticipates permanent financing for the acquisition to be raised through the issuance of a combination of equity and long term debt 
see capital resources above and note  common equity in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of the forward equity sale agreement entered into to fund a portion this acquisition 
the transaction is subject to various state and other regulatory approvals  such as the mpsc and the minnesota public utilities commission  and is subject to compliance with the hart scott rodino act 
mpsc approval was received in november and the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act has expired 
assuming an approval from the minnesota public utilities commission is obtained in a timely manner  wps resources anticipates closing both transactions in the first half of wps resources anticipates maintaining its current dividend policy following the closing 
sunbury wps resources made capital contributions of million to sunbury in in  wps resources made capital contributions of million to sunbury 
contributions made in were necessary to meet certain working capital requirements 
in  the capital contributions were used to cover operating losses  make principal and interest payments on debt  and purchase emission allowances 
in  wps resources board of directors granted authorization to contribute up to million of capital to sunbury 
at december   million of the originally authorized amount remains available for contribution 
financial results for sunbury have improved in  compared to  primarily due to more opportunities to sell power into the market as the result of the expiration of a fixed price out take contract on december  current energy market prices are significantly higher than the fixed price received under the expired contract 
the sale of sunbury s allocated emission allowances was completed in may total sales proceeds of million were utilized by sunbury to eliminate its nonrecourse debt obligation  which was subsequently restructured as a wps resources obligation in  which provides esi with flexibility to consider various alternatives for the plant 
all available solid fuel units at the sunbury plant were operated for most of  as market conditions were generally favorable 
when market conditions are unfavorable  esi plans to place the plant in a stand by mode of operation  which serves to minimize future operating expenses while maintaining several options for the plant including closing the plant  retaining the plant and operating it during favorable economic periods  or a potential future sale of the plant 
dispatching sunbury in a stand by mode of operation helps focus production on higher priced periods  generally in the winter and mid summer months 
the success of a stand by mode of operation depends on sunbury s ability to minimize costs during non operating periods

beaver falls esi s beaver falls generation facility in new york has been out of service since late june the unplanned outage was caused by the failure of the first stage turbine blades 
inclusive of estimated insurance recoveries  esi estimates  at this time  that it will cost between and million to repair the turbine and replace the damaged blades 
depending on the amount of insurance recovery  esi could incur significantly higher net out of pocket costs than originally estimated to repair the damage 
in addition  esi is attempting to renegotiate an existing steam off take agreement with a counterparty  which will significantly impact its ability to recover costs 
if significant repair costs are not recoverable through insurance or esi is not able to renegotiate the terms of the steam off take agreement  then a possibility exists that esi would not repair the plant  in which case the undiscounted cash flows related to future operations may be insufficient to recover the carrying value of the plant  resulting in impairment 
the carrying value of the beaver falls generation facility at december  was million 
asset management strategy as a part of our asset management strategy  in december  uppco sold a portion of its real estate holdings that were no longer needed for operations 
see note  acquisitions and sales of assets  in wps resources footnotes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
wps resources continues to evaluate alternatives for the sale of the balance of our identified real estate holdings no longer needed for operation 
regulatory matters and rate trends under the prevailing wisconsin fuel rules  wpsc s electric rates are subject to adjustment when electric generation fuel and purchased power costs fall outside of a pre determined band 
this band is set at and  for by the pscw 
because a significant portion of wpsc s electric load is served by natural gas fired generation  the volatile nature of natural gas prices  and the relatively narrow tolerance band in wisconsin  the likelihood for an electric rate adjustment in in wisconsin is strong 
any such rate adjustment would be on a prospective basis only and could impact wpsc s operating results 
to mitigate the risk of the potential for unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its pscw approved risk policy  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
the price of natural gas is currently high compared to historical levels 
while the wpsc gas utility is authorized one for one recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs in both the wisconsin and michigan jurisdictions  the currently high natural gas rates could impact the ability of retail customers to pay for natural gas service and  therefore  increase wpsc s write offs during in wpsc s retail electric rate proceeding  the pscw applied a financial harm test when considering the rate recovery of deferred costs previously authorized for accounting purposes 
while the application of a financial harm test is authorized  it has not been applied in the past by the pscw when considering the rate recovery of costs that were previously authorized for deferral 
in wpsc s rate proceeding  after applying the financial harm test  the pscw disallowed rate recovery of the extended outage at kewaunee 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of of the pre tax loss realized on the sale of kewaunee 
none of these disallowed costs were found to be imprudent by the pscw 
in light of the pscw s decision  wpsc still believes it is probable that all regulatory assets recorded at december   will be able to be collected from ratepayers 
for a discussion of regulatory filings and decisions  see note  regulatory environment  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note  regulatory assets and liabilities  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for a list of regulatory assets recorded at december  industry restructuring ohio in may  the ohio legislature passed senate bill  which introduced market based rates and instituted competitive retail electric services 
the bill also established a market development period beginning january   and extending no later than december   after which rates would be set at market based prices 
during this market development period  esi contracted to be the supplier for approximately  residential  small commercial  and government facilities in the firstenergy service areas under the state of ohio provisions for opt out electric aggregation programs 
the public utilities commission of ohio requested the ohio electric distribution utilities to file rate stabilization plans covering the time period to avoid rate shock at the end of the market development period 
a plan submitted by firstenergy established electric rates for consumers beginning in if a competitive bid auction ordered by the public utilities commission of ohio did not produce better benefits 
the price resulting from an auction conducted on december   was inadequate 
because the firstenergy plan is priced lower than current market power prices  esi took final meter readings and discontinued service to customers of the existing aggregation programs with the expiration of those contracts in december on september   an ohio house bill was introduced  proposing a change to the electric restructuring law 
the bill proposes to give the public utilities commission of ohio explicit authority to implement rate stabilization plans in certain circumstances 
the ohio senate held meetings during march to hear from all parties involved as they develop a statewide energy policy natural gas and electric 
the senate heard and considered such issues as rolling back senate bill  pushing ahead with electric deregulation  and the need for rate based utility construction of new power plants in the state 
in addition to the electric issues  the senate also heard about natural gas issues 
esi participated and testified  urging the senate to move forward to implement a competitive environment 
esi remains prepared to offer future retail electric service in ohio as the regulatory climate and market conditions allow 
michigan under the current electric choice program in michigan  esi  through its subsidiary  established itself as a significant supplier to the industrial and commercial markets 
however  recent high wholesale energy prices coupled with both approved and pending tariff changes for the regulated utilities significantly lowered the savings customers can obtain from contracting with non utility suppliers 
as a result  many customers returned to the bundled tariff service of the incumbent utility 
the high wholesale energy prices and tariff changes caused a reduction in new business and renewals for esi 
esi s michigan retail electric business as of the beginning of declined to approximately one third the peak megawatts it was at the start of the mpsc is expected to provide orders in two significant proceedings by the end of that will clarify the outlook for electric choice 
the status of michigan s electric markets has been the subject of hearings in both the senate and house energy committees 
if legislation rolling back the electric choice market is enacted  it could diminish the benefits of competitive supply for michigan business customers 
the impact on esi could range from maintaining michigan business with little or no growth to an inability to re contract any business  leading to a possible decision by esi to exit michigan s electric market and redirect resources to more vibrant markets 
it is not unreasonable to expect changes  either from the legislature or the mpsc  to have some level of negative impact on esi  but it is unlikely that michigan customers will lose all of the benefits of competition and revert back to a fully regulated monopoly supply 
esi is actively participating in the legislative and regulatory process in order to protect its interests in michigan 
expansion of operations into texas in the fourth quarter of  esi began developing a product offering in the texas retail electric market 
due to the thriving texas market structure unencumbered by a regulated offering that is not market based and having been presented with a good opportunity and approach to enter the texas retail market  esi hired experienced personnel in that region and expects to be an approved competitive supplier before the end of the second quarter of esi previously had a market presence in houston with natural gas producer services originators 
while historically  esi limited its retail activities to the northeastern quadrant of the united states and the adjacent portion of canada  the entry into the texas market offers an opportunity to leverage the infrastructure and capability esi developed to provide products and services that it believes customers will value 
seams elimination charge adjustment through a series of orders issued by the ferc  regional through and out rates for transmission service between the miso and the pjm interconnection were eliminated effective december  to compensate transmission owners for the revenue they will no longer receive due to this elimination  the ferc ordered a transitional pricing mechanism called the seams elimination charge adjustment seca to be put into place 
load serving entities will pay these seca charges during a month transition period from december   through march  esi is a load serving entity and will be billed based on its power imports into miso from pjm during and total exposure for the month transitional period  taken from proposed compliance filings by the transmission owners  is approximately million for esi  of which approximately million is for michigan and approximately million is for ohio 
through december   esi has made payments totaling million for these charges  of which million has been expensed 
on february   the ferc issued an order requesting compliance filings from transmission providers implementing the seca effective december   subject to refund and surcharge  as appropriate 
the application and legality of the seca is being challenged by many load serving entities  including esi 
on february   esi filed a motion for a partial stay of the february   ferc order  proposing that seca charges on its michigan load be postponed until a ferc order approves a decision or settlement in the formal hearing proceeding 
the ferc denied this motion on may  on june   esi filed with the ferc a request for rehearing of the order denying stay 
esi also participated in a joint petition to the district of columbia circuit court in an attempt to obtain a final order from the ferc on rehearing of the initial seca order 
this joint petition was denied 
in the interim  the exposure will be managed through customer charges and other available avenues  where feasible 
it is probable that esi s total exposure will be reduced by at least million because of inconsistencies between the ferc s seca order and the transmission owners compliance filings representing the difference between the amount esi has paid for seca charges and the amount that has been expensed as of december   as discussed above 
esi anticipates settling a significant portion of its seca matters through vendor negotiations in the first half of and reached a million settlement agreement with one of its vendors in january resolution of issues to be raised in the seca hearing offer the possibility of further reductions in esi s exposure  but the extent is unknown at present 
through existing contracts  esi has the ability to pass a portion of the seca charges on to customers and has been doing so 
since seca is a transition charge ending on march   it does not directly impact esi s long term competitiveness 
the seca is also an issue for wpsc and uppco  who have intervened and protested a number of proposals in this docket because those proposals could result in unjust  unreasonable  and discriminatory charges for electric customers 
it is anticipated that most of the seca charges and any refunds will be passed to customers through rates 
coal supply in may  wpsc received notification from its coal transportation suppliers that extensive maintenance was required on the railroad tracks that lead into and out of the powder river basin in wyoming 
the extensive maintenance ended on november  during the maintenance efforts  wpsc received approximately of its expected coal deliveries 
wpsc took steps to conserve coal usage and secured alternative coal supplies at its affected generation facilities during that time 
on september   the pscw approved wpsc s request for deferred treatment of the incremental fuel costs resulting from the coal supply issues 
as of december   million was deferred related to this matter 
these costs are expected to be addressed in wpsc s next retail electric rate case 
the union pacific railroad experienced a number of force majeure events in december and january  including a software conversion problem and heavy snow falls 
wpsc is closely monitoring the delivery of coal to its power plants and is analyzing options to be prepared if future coal deliveries are constrained 
income taxes american jobs creation act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law the american jobs creation act of jobs act 
the jobs act introduces a new tax deduction  the united states production activities deduction 
this domestic production provision allows as a deduction an amount equal to a specified percent of the lesser of the qualified production activities income of the taxpayer for the taxable year or taxable income for the taxable year 
the deduction is phased in  providing a deduction of of income through  of income through  and of income after on december   the pscw issued an order authorizing wpsc to defer the revenue requirements impacts resulting from the jobs act 
wpsc has recorded the estimated tax impact of this deduction in its financial statements for the year ended december  however  the majority of the tax benefits derived were deferred and will be passed on to customers in future rates 
section federal tax credits we have significantly reduced our consolidated federal income tax liability through tax credits available to us under section of the internal revenue code for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel from coal 
these tax credits are scheduled to expire at the end of and are provided as an incentive for taxpayers to produce fuel from alternate sources and reduce domestic dependence on imported oil 
this incentive is not deemed necessary if the price of oil increases sufficiently to provide a natural market for the fuel 
therefore  the tax credits in a given year are subject to phase out if the annual average reference price of oil within that year exceeds a minimum threshold price set by the internal revenue service irs and are eliminated entirely if the average annual reference price increases beyond a maximum threshold price set by the irs 
the reference price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average wellhead price per barrel for domestic crude oil  which has in recent history been approximately below the nymex price of a barrel of oil 
the threshold price at which the credit begins to phase out was set in and is adjusted annually for inflation  the irs releases the final numbers for a given year in the first part of the following year 
numerous events have increased domestic crude oil prices  including concerns about terrorism  storm related supply disruptions  and worldwide demand 
therefore  in order to manage exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce the amount of section federal tax credits that could be recognized  esi entered into a series of derivative contracts  beginning in the first quarter of  covering a specified number of barrels of oil 
while no apparent phase out of section federal tax credits occurred in  esi had mitigated essentially all of its phase out risk at no net cost 
through optimization strategies  esi realized a million gain on oil options entered into to mitigate the phase out risk  net of premium amortization 
if no phase out were to occur in and  esi would expect to recognize approximately million of section federal tax credits in each of the next two years 
based upon forward oil prices  we are anticipating significant phase outs of and section federal tax credits 
however  we cannot predict with certainty the future price of a barrel of oil and  therefore  have no way of knowing what portion of our tax credits will be phased out  or if any phase out will result 
based upon the average annual nymex price of a barrel of oil  esi estimates that section federal tax credits will begin phasing out if the annual average nymex price of a barrel of oil reaches approximately  with a total phase out if the annual average nymex price of a barrel of oil reaches approximately at december   esi had derivative contracts that mitigate substantially all of the section tax credit exposure in and of the exposure in the derivative contracts involve purchased and written call options that provide for net cash settlement at expiration based on the average nymex trading price of oil in relation to the strike price of each option 
premiums paid for options to mitigate exposure to section federal tax credit phase out in and totaled million million for options and million for options  all of which are recorded as risk management assets on the balance sheet 
essentially  esi has paid million for options million after tax to protect the value of approximately million of tax credits in and million for options million after tax to protect the value of approximately million of tax credits in esi has not hedged million of tax credits  however  esi will continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the exposure on the remaining tax credits 
as annual average oil prices become more transparent and if opportunities arise  esi will also look for ways to lower its investment in derivative instruments utilized to protect its section federal tax credits 
the derivative contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the options are recorded currently in earnings 
this could result in mark to market gains being recognized in earnings in different periods  compared to the offsetting tax credit phase outs 
for example  as of december   unrealized pre tax mark to market gains of million and million were recorded for the and options  respectively  while no tax credit phase out was recognized because and tax credits are not recognized until fuel is produced and sold in those periods 
in  esi will only record section federal tax credits expected to be recognized  based upon the expected annual average price of a barrel of oil 
in addition to exposure to federal tax credits  esi has also historically received royalties tied to the amount of synthetic fuel produced as well as variable payments from a counterparty related to its sell down of eco coal pelletization in royalties and variable payments contributed million  million  and million to income before taxes in   and  respectively 
royalties and variable payments received in and could decrease if a phase out occurs and synthetic fuel production is reduced 
the following table shows the total impact esi s investment in the synthetic fuel production facility had on the consolidated statements of income 
see note  acquisitions and sales of assets  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these items 
amounts are pre tax  except tax credits income loss provision for income taxes section federal tax credits recognized miscellaneous income operating losses synthetic fuel facility variable payments received royalty income recognized deferred gain recognized interest received on fixed note receivable minority interest peshtigo river land donation in  wps resources submitted a request to have the irs conduct a pre filing review of a tax position related to its tax return 
the tax position related to the value of the peshtigo river land donated to the wdnr in a pre filing review of the land donation deduction was initiated by the irs in the first quarter of  however  in the second quarter  wps resources and the irs mutually agreed to withdraw this issue from the pre filing review process  citing an inability to reach a consensus on the tax treatment and value of the land donated 
in  wps resources recorded a million income tax benefit related to the peshtigo river land donation 
we believe our position is appropriate and will pursue this matter if challenged by the irs upon examination of the tax return

energy and capacity prices prices for electric energy and capacity have been extremely volatile over the past three years 
wps resources nonregulated entities are impacted by this volatility  which has been driven by the exit of many of the largest speculative traders  equilibrium between natural gas supply and demand  changes in the economy  and significant overbuilding of generation capacity 
increased natural gas prices for fuel used in electric generation have caused current electric energy prices to increase significantly 
electric capacity prices  however  are expected to be depressed for several years 
pressure on capacity prices will continue until existing reserve margins are depleted either by load growth or capacity retirements 
market structure changes could also significantly influence capacity prices 
esi s generation facilities have been negatively impacted by the depressed capacity prices  however  certain plants within esi have been positively impacted by the high energy prices discussed above 
midwest independent transmission system operator wpsc  uppco  and esi are members of the miso  which introduced its day energy markets on april   when it began centrally dispatching wholesale electricity along with providing transmission service throughout much of the midwest 
the new market is based on a locational marginal pricing system  which is similar to that used by the pjm regional transmission organization 
the pricing mechanism expands the existing market from a physical market to also include financial instruments and is intended to send price signals to stakeholders where generation or transmission system expansion is needed 
based upon the early results of the transition  it does not appear that the new market will have a material ongoing impact on the financial results of wps resources 
wps resources will continue to work closely with the miso and the ferc to ensure that any issues are dealt with such that any adverse financial impacts continue to be minimal 
wpsc has been granted approval by the pscw to defer most costs and benefits related to the new market for inclusion in future rates for its wisconsin retail electric customers 
most costs and benefits related to wpsc s and uppco s michigan and wholesale electric customers will also flow through fuel adjustment mechanisms 
although the market is running well so far  there are still market issues that must be resolved 
miso day has the potential to significantly impact the cost of transmission for eastern wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan system  including wpsc and uppco  as well as our marketing affiliates in the miso footprint  such as esi 
under this market based approach  where there is abundant transmission capacity  overall costs should be less due to the ability to access cheaper generation from across the miso footprint 
for areas with narrowly constrained transmission capacity  such as wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan  costs could be higher due to the congestion and marginal loss pricing components 
for the utilities in eastern wisconsin and the upper peninsula of michigan  mechanisms have been deployed to offset these potential increased costs in the first five years of the day market 
if the market works appropriately  the costs to esi  excluding the seca discussed above  should be similar to the pre day market costs 
if there are incremental costs or savings to wpsc and uppco  they will be passed through to our customers under existing tariffs 
wpsc and uppco received approval from their respective commissions to defer costs associated with implementation of the miso day market million has been deferred through december   however  wpsc and uppco face regulatory risk associated with being able to collect these costs from customers in future periods 
wpsc has established an energy market risk policy and a risk management plan to facilitate utilization of financial instruments for managing market risks associated with the day energy market 
the pscw has approved this plan  allowing wpsc to pass the costs and benefits of several specific risk management strategies through the pscw s fuel rules  deferral  or escrow processes 
as of december   risk mitigation opportunities have been limited due to the current high price of energy 
miso participants offer their generation and bid their demand into the market on an hourly basis 
this results in net receipts from or net obligations to miso for each hour of each day 
miso aggregates these hourly transactions and currently provides updated settlement statements to market participants     and days after each operating day 
miso also indicated that it may begin performing a day settlement run on april  the day settlement statements could continue until all operating day transactions from april  through august  have been resettled 
these updated settlement statements may reflect billing adjustments  resulting in an increase or decrease to the net receipt from or net obligation to miso  which may or may not be recovered through the rate recovery process 
these updated settlement statements and related charges may be disputed by market participants 
at the end of each month  the amount due from or payable to miso is estimated for those operating days where a day settlement statement is not yet available  thus significant changes in the estimates and new information provided by miso in subsequent settlement statements could have a material impact on our results of operations

market price risk management activities wps resources market price risk management activities include the electric and natural gas marketing and related risk management activities of esi 
esi s marketing and trading operations manage power and natural gas procurement as an integrated portfolio with its retail and wholesale sales commitments 
derivative instruments are utilized in these operations 
esi measures the fair value of derivative instruments including nymex exchange and over the counter contracts  options  natural gas and electric power physical fixed price contracts  basis contracts  and related financial instruments on a mark to market basis 
the fair value of derivatives are shown as assets or liabilities from risk management activities on wps resources consolidated balance sheets 
the offsetting entry to assets or liabilities from risk management activities is to other comprehensive income or earnings  depending on the use of the derivative  how it is designated  and if it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the fair values of derivative instruments are adjusted each reporting period using various market sources and risk management systems 
the primary input for natural gas and oil pricing is the settled forward price curve of the nymex exchange  which includes outright contracts and options 
basis pricing is derived from published indices and documented broker quotes 
esi bases electric prices on published indices and documented broker quotes 
the following table provides an assessment of the factors impacting the change in the net value of esi s assets and liabilities from risk management activities for the year ended december  esi mark to market roll forward millions oil options natural gas electric total fair value of contracts at january  less contracts realized or settled during period plus changes in fair value of contracts in existence at december  fair value of contracts at december  the fair value of contracts at january   and december   reflects the values reported on the balance sheet for net mark to market current and long term risk management assets and liabilities as of those dates 
contracts realized or settled during the period includes the value of contracts in existence at january   that were no longer included in the net mark to market assets as of december   along with the amortization of those derivatives later designated as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
changes in fair value of existing contracts include unrealized gains and losses on contracts that existed at january   and contracts that were entered into subsequent to january   which are included in esi s portfolio at december  there were  in many cases  offsetting positions entered into and settled during the period resulting in gains or losses being realized during the current period 
the realized gains or losses from these offsetting positions are not reflected in the table above 
market quotes are more readily available for short duration contracts 
the table below shows the sources of fair value and maturity of esi s risk management instruments 
esi risk management contract aging at fair value as of december  source of fair value millions maturity less than year maturity to years maturity to years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value we derive the pricing for most contracts in the above table from active quotes or external sources 
prices actively quoted includes exchange traded contracts such as nymex contracts and basis swaps 
prices provided by external sources includes electric and natural gas contract positions for which pricing information  used by esi to calculate fair value  is obtained primarily through broker quotes and other publicly available sources 
prices based on models and other valuation methods includes electric contracts for which reliable external pricing information does not exist 
esi employs a variety of physical and financial instruments offered in the marketplace to limit risk exposure associated with fluctuating commodity prices and volumes  enhance value  and minimize cash flow volatility 
however  the application of sfas no 
and its related hedge accounting rules causes esi to experience earnings volatility associated with electric and natural gas operations  as well as oil options utilized to protect the value of a portion of esi s section federal tax credits 
while risks associated with power generating capacity and power and natural gas sales are economically hedged  certain transactions do not meet the definition of a derivative or do not qualify for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
consequently  gains and losses from these positions may not match with the related physical and financial hedging instruments in some reporting periods 
the result can cause volatility in esi s reported period by period earnings  however  the financial impact of this timing difference will reverse at the time of physical delivery and or settlement 
the accounting treatment does not impact the underlying cash flows or economics of these transactions 
see results of operations wps resources above for information regarding earnings volatility caused by the natural gas storage cycle 
critical accounting policies wps resources we have identified the following accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
wps resources management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities wps resources has entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   those derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily commodity contracts used to manage price risk associated with natural gas and electricity purchase and sale activities  as well as oil options used to manage exposure to the risk of an increase in oil prices that could reduce the amount of section federal tax credits we could recognize from esi s investment in a synthetic fuel production facility 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used when wps resources contracts to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery to protect future cash flows corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases 
fair value hedge accounting may be used when wps resources holds assets or firm commitments and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity may change between the contract s inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity 
to the extent that the hedging instrument is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on income available for common shareholders prior to settlement of the hedge 
in addition  wps resources may apply the normal purchases and sales exception  provided by sfas no 
 as amended  to certain contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exception provides that recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contract 
derivative contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of sfas no 
 as amended  are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets of wps resources 
changes in fair value  except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  are generally included in the determination of income available for common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
when available  quoted market prices are used to determine a contract s fair value 
if no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contract s duration  fair value is estimated through the use of internally developed valuation techniques or models using external information wherever possible 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by wps resources management 
as a component of the fair value determination  wps resources maintains operating reserves to account for the estimated direct costs of servicing and holding certain of its contracts based upon administrative costs  counterparty credit risk  and liquidity risk 
the effect of changing the underlying assumptions for these operating reserves is as follows change in assumption effect on operating reserve at december  millions increase increase decrease decrease these potential changes to the operating reserve would be included in current and long term liabilities from risk management activities on the consolidated balance sheets and as part of the nonregulated cost of fuel  gas and purchased power on the consolidated statements of income unless the related contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  in which case potential changes would be included in other comprehensive income cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of common shareholders equity 
asset impairment wps resources annually reviews its assets for impairment 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  form the basis for these analyses 
the review for impairment of tangible assets is more critical to esi than to our other segments because of its significant investment in property  plant  and equipment and lack of access to regulatory relief that is available to our regulated segments 
at december   the carrying value of esi s property  plant  and equipment totaled million 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of power plants is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future market sales pricing  production costs  capital expenditures  and generation volumes and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
management s assumptions about future market sales prices and generation volumes require significant judgment because actual market sales prices and generation volumes have fluctuated in the past as a result of changing fuel costs  environmental changes  and required plant maintenance and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the primary estimates used at esi in the impairment analysis are future revenue streams and operating costs 
a combination of inputs from both internal and external sources is used to project revenue streams 
esi forecasts future operating costs with input from external sources for fuel costs and forward energy prices 
these estimates are modeled over the projected remaining life of the power plants using the methodology defined in sfas no 
esi evaluates property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
sfas no 
requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
for assets held for sale  impairment charges are recorded if the carrying value of such assets exceeds the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by reducing the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
throughout  esi tested its power plants for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amount might not be recoverable 
there was an impairment charge recorded on the sunbury plant in see note  sunbury plant  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
no other impairment charges were recorded in as a result of the recoverability tests 
results of past impairment tests may not necessarily be an indicator of future tests given the criticality of the accounting estimates involved  as discussed more fully above 
changes in actual results or assumptions could result in an impairment 
wpsc recorded goodwill of million in its gas utility segment following the merger of wisconsin fuel and light into wpsc in the goodwill is tested for impairment annually based on the guidance of sfas no 
the test for impairment includes assumptions about future profitability of the gas utility segment and the correlation between our gas utility segment and published projections for other similar gas utility segments 
a significant change in the natural gas utility market and or our projections of future profitability could result in a loss being recorded on the income statement related to a decrease in the goodwill asset as a result of the impairment test 
receivables and reserves our regulated natural gas and electric utilities and esi accrue estimated amounts of revenue for services rendered but not yet billed 
estimated unbilled sales are calculated using actual generation and throughput volumes  recorded sales  and weather factors 
the estimated unbilled sales are assigned different rates based on historical customer class allocations 
at december  and  the amount of unbilled revenues was million and million  respectively 
any difference between actual sales and the estimates or weather factors would cause a change in the estimated revenue 
wps resources records reserves for potential uncollectible customer accounts as an expense on the income statement and an uncollectible reserve on the balance sheet 
wpsc  however  records a regulatory asset to offset its uncollectible reserve 
because the nonregulated energy marketing business involves higher credit risk  the reserve is more critical to esi than to our other segments 
at esi  the reserve is based on historical uncollectible experience and specific customer identification where practical 
if the assumption that historical uncollectible experience matches current customer default is incorrect  or if a specific customer with a large account receivable that has not previously been identified as a risk defaults  there could be significant changes to the expense and uncollectible reserve balance 
pension and postretirement benefits the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements  are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining the projected benefit and other postretirement benefit obligation and pension and other postretirement benefit costs  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
wps resources pension plan assets and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
management believes that such changes in costs would be recovered at our regulated segments through the ratemaking process 
the following chart shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation  the net amount recognized on the balance sheet  and the reported annual pension cost on the income statement as they relate to all of our defined benefit pension plans 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only

regression analysis is applied to construct a best fit curve that makes coupon yields to maturity a function of time to maturity 
the pension or retiree medical cash flows are then matched to the appropriate spot rates and discounted back to the measurement date 
to select an assumed long term rate of return on qualified plan assets  we consider the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in and in and for  the actual return on plan assets  net of fees  was a gain of million 
the actual return on plan assets  net of fees  was a gain of million and million in and  respectively 
we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized over a five year period 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
more information on health care cost trend rates can be found in note  employee benefit plans  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
for a table showing future payments that wps resources expects to make for pension and other postretirement benefits  see note  employee benefit plans  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory accounting the electric and gas utility segments of wps resources follow sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
we defer certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as expenses and revenues because our regulators have authorized deferral as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  earnings at the utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
once approved  we amortize the regulatory assets and liabilities into income over the rate recovery period 
if recovery of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period income 
if our regulated electric and gas utility segments no longer meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 we would discontinue its application as defined under sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of sfas no 
assets and liabilities recognized solely due to the actions of rate regulation would no longer be recognized on the balance sheet and would be classified as an extraordinary item in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all wps resources regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in a decrease in total assets  a decrease in total liabilities  and a increase in income before taxes 
tax provision as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an expense within the tax provisions in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data and reasonable projections 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on wps resources financial condition and results of operations 
impact of inflation wps resources our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wpsc s and uppco s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because rate forecasting assumes inflation  most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wpsc and uppco are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs 
however  any increase from inflation is offset with projected business growth 
therefore  the estimated effect of inflation on our nonregulated businesses is minor 
results of operations wpsc wpsc is a regulated electric and natural gas utility as well as a holding company 
electric operations accounted for approximately of revenues in  while natural gas operations contributed to revenues 
compared with wpsc overview wpsc s results of operations for the years ended december are shown in the following table wpsc s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock electric utility revenue increased million  largely due to an approved electric rate increase for wpsc s wisconsin retail customers and an increase in electric sales volumes 
gas utility revenue increased million due to an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  higher natural gas throughput volumes  and an approved rate increase 
revenue changes by reportable segment are discussed in more detail below 
wpsc s earnings on common stock were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as discussed in more detail below  the following factors negatively impacted earnings for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to electric utility earnings were negatively impacted by fuel and purchased power costs that were million in excess of what wpsc was allowed to recover from its customers due to inefficiencies in the fuel recovery process million related to retail customers and million related to wholesale customers 
in addition  the pscw s ruling in the rate case  which disallowed recovery of costs that were deferred related to the kewaunee outage and a portion of the loss on the kewaunee sale  resulted in the write off of million of regulatory assets 
natural gas utility earnings decreased million  driven by higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation expense 
pre tax gains on land sales at wpsc decreased million in  compared to wpsc recognized pre tax land sale gains of million in  compared to pre tax land sale gains of million in wpsc recognized an income tax benefit in from the donation of land to the wdnr 
electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to an approved electric rate increase for wpsc s wisconsin retail customers and an increase in electric sales volumes 
on december   the pscw approved a retail electric rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was required primarily to recover increased costs related to fuel and purchased power  the construction of the weston power plant  and benefit costs 
electric sales volumes increased  primarily due to significantly warmer weather during the cooling season  compared to the same period in  and new power sales agreements that were entered into with wholesale customers 
as a result of the warm weather  wpsc set all time records for peak electric demand in the second and third quarters of the electric utility margin decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   largely driven by the sale of kewaunee on july   and the related power purchase agreement 
prior to the sale of kewaunee  only nuclear fuel expense was reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
subsequent to the sale  all payments to dominion for power purchased from kewaunee are reported as a component of fuel and purchased power costs 
these include both variable payments for energy delivered and fixed payments 
as a result of the sale  wpsc no longer incurs operating and maintenance expense  depreciation and decommissioning expense  or interest expense for kewaunee 
excluding the million of fixed payments made to dominion in  wpsc s electric utility margin increased million compared to excluding the fixed payments to dominion  the increase in margin was primarily related to the approved retail electric rate increase discussed above and the warm summer weather conditions  partially offset by higher fuel and purchased power costs associated with high natural gas prices and the pscw s disallowance of certain costs in its decision on the rate case for wpsc these costs were previously approved for deferral 
fuel and purchased power costs incurred in exceeded the amount recovered from ratepayers by million of which million related to wisconsin retail customers and million related to wholesale customers  negatively impacting margin 
the increase in fuel and purchased power costs resulted primarily from the destruction of certain natural gas production facilities in the gulf of mexico by hurricanes in the third quarter of  driving up the per unit cost of natural gas used in generation 
the quantity of power generated from wpsc s natural gas fired units was also up over the prior year  driven by the warm summer weather conditions experienced during  increased dispatch by the miso for reliability purposes  and purchases through a power purchase agreement from the fox energy center which began operating in june 
certain costs related to the miso were approved for deferral 
authorization was requested from the pscw to defer increased natural gas costs related to the hurricanes  but this request was denied  leaving the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism as the only option for recovery 
however  because of the way the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism works  the million increase in costs primarily related to the combination of rising natural gas prices caused by the hurricanes and the increase in natural gas fired generation were essentially unrecoverable since they were incurred late in the year 
to mitigate the risk of unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its risk policy approved by the pscw  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
the pscw also disallowed recovery of million of increased fuel and purchased power costs related to an extended outage at kewaunee in  resulting in this deferral being written off in the fourth quarter of electric utility earnings decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease in earnings resulted from the high fuel and purchased power costs that wpsc was unable to recover from its wisconsin retail and wholesale customers  the pscw s disallowance of previously deferred costs related to kewaunee  and an increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility operations gas utility results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to gas utility revenue increased primarily as a result of an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  a natural gas rate increase  and higher natural gas throughput volumes 
natural gas costs increased on a per unit basis for the year ended december   compared to following regulatory practice  wpsc passes changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause  as allowed by the pscw and the mpsc 
the pscw issued an order authorizing a natural gas rate increase of million  effective january  the rate increase was primarily driven by higher benefit costs and the cost of natural gas distribution system improvements 
natural gas throughput volumes increased  driven by an increase in interdepartmental sales from the natural gas utility to the electric utility as a result of increased generation from combustion turbines 
higher natural gas throughput volumes from interdepartmental sales to the electric utility were partially offset by lower natural gas throughput volumes to residential customers  driven by milder weather conditions in compared to wpsc also believes customers are taking measures to conserve energy as a result of the high natural gas prices 
the natural gas utility margin increased million for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin was largely due to the rate increase mentioned above 
the increase in interdepartmental sales volumes to wpsc s electric utility also had a positive impact on the natural gas margin 
gas utility earnings for the year ended december   decreased million  primarily due to an increase in operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation expense incurred by the gas utility 
operating expenses operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared to the following items were the most significant contributors to the change in operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc the combined increase in pension expense  active and postretirement medical expense  salaries  and customer service expense was approximately million 
transmission related expenses increased million 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw concluded that only half of the loss related to the sale of kewaunee could be collected from ratepayers 
as a result  wpsc wrote off million of the regulatory asset established for the loss on the sale of kewaunee 
in wpsc s rate case  the pscw also disallowed recovery of increased operating and maintenance expenses related to the extended outage at kewaunee  resulting in a million write off of previously deferred costs 
the increases discussed above were partially offset by a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of approximately million related to kewaunee  due to the sale of this facility on july  depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to  driven by higher gains on decommissioning trust assets prior to the sale of kewaunee of approximately million 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets included as a component of miscellaneous income offset the increased decommissioning expense pursuant to regulatory practice 
continued capital investment at wpsc also resulted in an increase in depreciation expense 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation resulting from the sale of the kewaunee assets in july federal income taxes state income taxes other income the period over period change in these account balances was primarily related to the increase in realized gains recognized on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets in approximately million of the increase in other income related to the realized gains on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets 
the nonqualified nuclear decommissioning trust assets were placed in more conservative investments in the second quarter of in anticipation of the sale of kewaunee  which closed on july  pursuant to regulatory practice  the increase in miscellaneous income related to the realized gains was offset by an increase in decommissioning expense 
income tax expense related to the realized gains was offset by a deferred tax benefit related to the decommissioning expense 
overall  the change in the investment strategy for the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets had no impact on earnings  as summarized in the table below 
millions income expense depreciation and decommissioning expense federal income taxes state income taxes other  net income taxes total earnings impact other income at wpsc increased million in compared to excluding the increase in other income related to higher realized gains on the nonqualified decommissioning trust assets in and the decrease in other income related to higher income taxes related to these realized gains  miscellaneous income decreased approximately million 
the remaining decrease was primarily driven by a million decrease in pre tax gains on land sales 
wpsc recognized pre tax land sale gains of million in  compared to pre tax land sale gains of million in this decrease was partially offset by dpc s reimbursement of million of carrying costs incurred by wpsc related to the weston power plant 
the reimbursement was recorded within miscellaneous income 
wpsc sold a interest in the weston power plant to dpc in the fourth quarter of proceeds received from the sale included a reimbursement for approximately million of carrying costs incurred by wpsc for capital expenditures related to dpcs portion of the facility  which were funded by wpsc in and compared with wpsc overview wpsc s results of operations for the years ended december are shown in the following table wpsc s results millions change operating revenues earnings on common stock approved retail and wholesale electric rate increases drove a million increase in wpsc s electric revenue 
the million increase in wpsc s natural gas revenue was driven by an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas and an authorized retail natural gas rate increase  partially offset by a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes resulting from unfavorable weather conditions 
wpsc s earnings on common stock were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in as discussed in more detail below  the following factors impacted earnings for the year ended december   compared to the same period in approved rate increases including the impact of timely retail electric rate relief in  compared to the delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in favorably impacted the electric margin 
an approved retail natural gas rate increase favorably impacted the natural gas margin at wpsc  but a decrease in natural gas throughput volumes partially offset the favorable impact of this rate increase 
land sales  land donations  and higher earnings from equity investments favorably impacted earnings 
higher operating and maintenance expense negatively impacted earnings 
electric utility operations electric utility results millions change revenues fuel and purchased power margins sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenue increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in electric utility revenue increased largely due to authorized retail and wholesale electric rate increases for wpsc s wisconsin and michigan customers see discussion within results of operations wps resources to recover higher fuel and purchased power costs  increased operating expenses  and expenditures incurred for infrastructure improvements 
electric utility sales volumes were also slightly higher in  increasing over sales volumes 
a increase in sales volumes to commercial and industrial customers was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes to residential customers 
higher sales volumes to our commercial and industrial customers reflect an improving economy and growth within our service area  while the decrease in sales volumes to residential customers reflects weather that was cooler during the cooling season  compared to wpsc s electric margin increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the increase in wpsc s electric margin is primarily related to the retail and wholesale electric rate increases  partially offset by a million increase in purchased power costs 
the quantity of power purchased in increased over purchases and purchased power costs were higher on a per unit basis in  compared to the pscw allowed wpsc to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs were in excess of plus or minus from approved levels 
in response to a request for additional fuel cost recovery filed early in  wpsc was allowed to recover million of its increased fuel and purchased power costs during the pscw also allowed wpsc to defer million of unanticipated fuel and purchased power costs directly associated with the extension of the kewaunee refueling outage in the fourth quarter of the kewaunee outage was extended three weeks due primarily to difficulties encountered with lifting equipment related to the reactor vessel and procedures to perform the lifts 
it was anticipated that these costs would be recovered in  however  in the pscw s final decision allowing wpsc authority to increase retail electric and natural gas rates in  the pscw determined wpsc could not recover the costs for the extended outage 
for more information on this determination  see note  regulatory environment  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
wpsc s electric earnings increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the increased earnings were largely driven by the higher margin including the effect of timely retail electric rate relief in compared to a delay in receiving retail electric rate relief in  partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses 
gas utility operations gas utility results millions change revenues purchase costs margins throughput in therms gas utility revenue increased million  for the year ended december   compared to higher revenue was driven by an authorized rate increase and an increase in the per unit cost of natural gas  partially offset by an overall decrease in natural gas throughput volumes 
natural gas prices increased per unit in higher natural gas prices reflect higher marketplace natural gas costs in the pscw and the mpsc allow wpsc to pass changes in the total cost of natural gas on to customers 
as a result  changes in the price of the natural gas commodity do not have a direct impact on wpsc s margin 
the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes was driven by weather that was warmer during the heating season for the year ended december   compared to the natural gas utility margin increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the higher natural gas utility margin was largely due to the authorized rate increase mentioned above 
the ability of wpsc to realize the full benefit of an authorized rate increase is dependent upon normal throughput volumes  therefore  the decrease in natural gas throughput volumes negatively impacted wpsc s ability to benefit from the full amount of the rate increase 
the higher margin drove a million  increase in gas utility earnings for the year ended december  operating expenses operating expenses millions change operating and maintenance expense depreciation and decommissioning expense operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expenses at wpsc increased million  for the year ended december   compared to electric transmission and distribution costs were up million due primarily to an increase in transmission rates 
pension and postretirement medical costs incurred at wpsc increased million 
additionally  million of the increase was driven by amortization of costs incurred in conjunction with the implementation of the automated meter reading system and the purchase of the de pere energy center previously deferred as regulatory assets 
maintenance expenses at wpsc s coal fired generation facilities were million higher in  compared to  driven by an extension of the annual planned outage at the pulliam generation facility in higher payroll and other benefit costs also contributed to the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the fall refueling outage at kewaunee did not significantly impact the year over year change in operating and maintenance expenses as there was also a refueling outage at kewaunee in the spring of  and the pscw approved the deferral of incremental operating and maintenance expenses that were incurred as a direct result of the refueling outage extension million of operating and maintenance expenses were deferred in the fourth quarter of 
it was anticipated that these costs would be recovered in  however  in the pscw s final decision allowing wpsc authority to increase retail electric and natural gas rates in  the pscw determined wpsc could not recover the costs for the extended outage 
for more information on this determination  see note  regulatory environment  in wps resources notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and decommissioning expense depreciation and decommissioning expense decreased million  for the year ended december   compared to  due primarily to a decrease of million resulting from lower realized gains on decommissioning trust assets and because the decommissioning trust was not funded in in anticipation of selling kewaunee 
realized gains on decommissioning trust assets are substantially offset by depreciation expense pursuant to regulatory practice 
an increase in depreciation expense from plant asset additions at wpsc partially offset the decrease in decommissioning expense 
other income other income decreased million  from million in  to million in  largely due to a decrease in realized gains on decommissioning trust assets of million 
lower realized gains were substantially offset by lower decommissioning expense  as discussed above 
partially offsetting the lower gains on decommissioning trust assets were higher earnings realized from equity investments and an increase in gains recognized from land sales in  compared to balance sheet wpsc compared with net utility plant decreased million  from  million at december   to  million at december  the major contributors to the change in net utility plant are summarized below nuclear decommissioning trusts decreased from million at december   to at december  the qualified decommissioning trust assets were included in the kewaunee sale and the nonqualified decommissioning assets were liquidated 
the kewaunee plant was sold in  driving a million decrease in net utility plant 
depreciation expense of million was recorded in wpsc sold a interest in weston  driving an million decrease in net utility plant 
partially offsetting the decreases above  capital expenditures recorded in were million  primarily related to the construction of weston customer and other receivables increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the increase was largely due to a per unit increase in natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of an increase in retail electric rates combined with an increase in electric sales volumes in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of also contributed to the increase in customer and other receivables at wpsc 
natural gas in storage increased million  from million at december   to million at december  natural gas in storage is built up throughout the year and  therefore  the increase in the average per unit cost of natural gas purchased by wpsc in  compared to was the primary driver of the increase in natural gas in storage 
assets from risk management activities increased million  from million at december   to million at december   primarily related to mark to market gains recorded on financial transmission rights related to our participation in miso 
mark to market gains on these derivative instruments are deferred as a regulatory liability pursuant to regulatory approval 
regulatory assets increased million  from million at december   to million at december   largely due to million of costs that were deferred related to the unplanned outage at kewaunee in  a million increase in the regulatory asset related to the minimum pension liability  deferral of million of miso day charges  and a million deferral of a portion of the loss on the sale of kewaunee 
accounts payable increased million  from million at december   to million at december  the increase was driven by higher per unit natural gas costs and higher per unit fuel and purchased power costs in compared to regulatory liabilities increased million  from million at december   to million at december   driven by a million regulatory liability related to proceeds received from the liquidation of the nonqualified decommissioning trust in connection with the kewaunee sale 
the regulatory liability related to mark to market gains on derivative instruments also increased million  primarily related to mark to market gains recorded on financial transmission rights related to our participation in miso 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the regulatory liability pertaining to the asset retirement obligation recorded related to the decommissioning of kewaunee as this plant was sold on july   and a million reduction in deferred unrealized gains on decommissioning trust assets as the trust assets were either liquidated or transferred in the sale of kewaunee 
asset retirement obligations decreased from million at december   to million at december   driven by the transfer of our obligation to decommission kewaunee as this plant was sold on july  liquidity and capital resources wpsc wpsc believes that its cash  operating cash flows  and borrowing ability because of strong credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects 
however  wpsc s operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside its control 
in addition  wpsc s borrowing costs can be impacted by its short term and long term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
currently  wpsc believes these ratings continue to be among the best in the energy industry see liquidity and capital resources wps resources for more information 
operating cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by various expenditures incurred in  which will not be collected from ratepayers until future years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks and other significant risks wps resources has potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk including regulatory recovery risk  interest rate risk  equity return risk  and principal preservation risk 
wps resources is also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries business and the environment from which we operate 
wps resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk and regulatory recovery risk wpsc burns natural gas in several of its peaking power plants  as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants  and supplies natural gas as fuel to generate energy as part of a purchased power agreement with fox energy center 
natural gas costs typically impact the cost of fuel used in electric generation as well as purchased power costs 
regulatory commissions allow utilities to earn a return on common stock equity that is commensurate with an investor s expected return  compensating for the risks investors face when providing funds to the utility 
the return on common stock equity approved by the pscw  the ferc  and the mpsc was   and  respectively  in and   and  respectively  in the utilities bear volume risk as rates are based upon normal sales volumes as projected by the utility 
historically  consumers bear most of the price risk for fuel and purchased power costs as our regulators typically have allowed the utilities to recover most of these costs to the extent they are prudently incurred  through various cost recovery mechanisms 
however  wpsc is exposed to the risk of not recovering increased fuel costs for wisconsin retail customers under the current electric fuel recovery rules 
under the wisconsin fuel recovery mechanism  certain costs are only recoverable on a pro rata basis for the portion of the year after pscw approval 
as such  the ability of our regulated utilities to earn their approved return on equity is dependent upon accurate forecasting  the ability to obtain timely rate increases to account for rising cost structures while minimizing the required rate increases in order to maintain the competitiveness of our core industrial customer base and keep these customers in our service area  and certain conditions that are outside of their control such as macroeconomic factors and weather conditions 
to mitigate the risk of unrecoverable fuel costs in due to market price volatility  wpsc is employing risk management techniques pursuant to its risk policy approved by the pscw  including the use of derivative instruments such as futures and options 
an additional risk within the ratemaking process  regulatory lag risk  occurs between the time we submit rate proceedings and the time we receive the final approval or denial from the pscw  mpsc  or ferc 
the regulatory lag risk may increase or decrease with any change in commodity prices  unplanned outages  or unscheduled maintenance during the approval period 
although the pscw grants wpsc the ability to defer costs related to fuel and purchased power  the pscw does not guarantee us the ability to recover the deferred costs from the ratepayers at a later point in time 
to further manage commodity price risk and the associated regulatory lag risk  our regulated utilities enter into contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  esi s activities are classified as non trading 
esi has the ability to reduce market price risk and extract additional value from its merchant generation plants through the use of various financial and physical tools including forward contracts and options 
esi also utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage market risks related to its retail supply portfolio 
value at risk a value at risk analysis is utilized in order to measure commodity price risk exposure at esi 
esi s value at risk calculation is utilized to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its marketing and trading portfolio primarily natural gas and power positions  which includes near term positions managed under its asset management strategy through tolling agreements with the merchant generating fleet  but excludes the long dated positions created by the merchant generating fleet and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  and other ancillary fuels 
value at risk is used to describe a probabilistic approach to quantifying the exposure to market risk 
the value at risk amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
value at risk models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being used may have features that could trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
value at risk is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
in addition to value at risk  esi employs other risk measurements including mark to market valuations and stress testing 
in conjunction with the value at risk  these other risk measurements provide the risk management analysis for esi s risk exposure 
esi s value at risk is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
esi s value at risk calculation includes derivative financial and commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options as well as commodities held in inventory  such as natural gas held in storage to the extent such positions are significant 
the value at risk for esi s trading portfolio is presented in the following table value at risk var disclosure for esi value at risk calculations trading var in millions confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed december average for twelve months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the value at risk amount for esi increased million from december   to december   due to extreme price volatility in the market  post hurricane production shut ins  and unusual fluctuations in the various portfolios 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the value at risk amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts 
interest rate risk wps resources and wpsc are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from their variable rate long term debt and short term commercial paper borrowing 
exposure to interest rate risk is managed by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
wps resources and wpsc enter into long term fixed rate debt when it is advantageous to do so 
wps resources and wpsc may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
in the second quarter of  a variable rate non recourse debt instrument used to finance the purchase of sunbury was restructured to a wps resources obligation 
an interest rate swap used to fix the interest rate on the sunbury non recourse debt was previously designated as a cash flow hedge 
subsequent to the restructuring  the interest rate swap was re designated as a cash flow hedge  along with an additional interest rate swap  to fix the interest rate on the wps resources obligation 
based on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wpsc outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points in would have increased annual interest expense in by approximately million at wps resources and million at wpsc 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense in by approximately million at wps resources and million at wpsc 
these amounts were determined by performing a sensitivity analysis on the impact of a hypothetical basis points increase in interest rates on the variable rate debt of wps resources and wpsc outstanding as of december  and the sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in the levels of interest rates  with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would take action to mitigate wps resources and wpsc s exposure to the change 
equity return and principal preservation risk wps resources and wpsc currently fund liabilities accumulated benefit obligations related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
wps resources maintains a qualified pension plan for employees retirement 
the liability accumulated benefit obligation of the qualified plan was less than the value of the qualified plan s assets by million at december   and wps resources was required to recognize a minimum pension liability as prescribed by sfas no 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future pension costs for the plan and possible future required contributions 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits could also impact future contributions 
wps resources monitors the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to wps resources regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  mitigating the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
foreign currency exchange rate risk wps resources is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of foreign operations owned and operated in canada and transactions denominated in canadian dollars for the purchase and sale of natural gas and electricity by our nonregulated subsidiaries 
forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on certain firm sales and sales commitments denominated in canadian dollars and certain canadian dollar denominated asset and liability positions 
wps resources exposure to foreign currency risk was not significant at december   or construction risk large construction projects  such as weston  are subject to various construction risks  which we have little or no control over  and can negatively affect completion time and project costs 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the shortage of or inability to obtain labor or materials  unfavorable weather conditions  events in the economy  and changes in applicable laws or regulations
