item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related note s for the year ended december  contained in this annual report on pages f to f and with the risk factors appearing under item a 
risk factors in this annual report 
overview general quanta holdings was incorporated on may  as a bermuda holding company formed to provide specialty lines insurance  reinsurance  risk assessment and risk technical services on a global basis through its affiliated companies 
we commenced substantive operations on september  when we obtained our initial capital and purchased esc  our predecessor for accounting purposes 
during the remainder of  we wrote a small number of insurance an d reinsurance contracts 
during the years ended december  and  we continued to grow our specialty lines of business significantly increasing the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts underwritten 
through our operating subsidiaries in bermuda  the us and europe  w e focus on writing coverage for specialized classes of risks through teams of experienced and technically qualified underwriters 
specialty lines of business are often unusual or difficult to place and do not fit the underwriting criteri a of standard commercial product providers 
we have used our bermuda operations primarily to insure us risks from bermuda on a non admitted basis and also  from time to time  to underwrite some european risks 
we also write specialty products in the united states on an admitted basis through our subsidiary  quanta indemnity  which is a us licensed insurer with licenses in states and is an accredited reinsurer in washington  dc further  during we wrot e specialty insurance from the united states on an excess and surplus lines basis and us reinsurance on a non admitted basis through our subsidiary  quanta specialty lines 
since the fourth quarter of  we are underwriting european union sourced specialty business through quanta europe  our irish subsidiary located in dublin  ireland  which is the headquarters of our european business 
we are also underwriting through our wholly owned lloyd s syndicate  which we call syndicate since february  we are serving our london based clients for european insurance and reinsurance business through our quanta europe branch in london 
we acquired environmental strategies corporation  known as esc  on september  esc is our predecessor company for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
esc provides diversified environmental risk management services to assist customers in environmental remediation  regulatory analyses  technical support for environmental claims  merger and acquisition due diligence  environmental audits and risk assessments  and engineering and information management services 
esc also provides risk assessment and technica l services support to our environmental underwriters 
we expect esc s operations will be adversely affected to the extent our environmental insurance product line and our other insurance and reinsurance product lines that have used esc s consulting services are no longer able to continue to write coverage or lose business opportunities due to the recent am best downgrade of our financial strength ratings 
in addition to these consulting services  we provide liabilit y assumption programs through quanta technical services and its subsidiaries unde r which these subsidiaries assume specified liabilities associated with environmental conditions  which may be insured or guaranteed by us or an insurance subsidiary 
under these programs  our technical services team provide s consulting and performs the required remediation services through subcontractors 
our liability assumption programs during the year ended decembe r  included our buffalo  new york and axis  alabama programs 
the estimated remaining liabilities for these programs are approximately million  as of december  we are currently evaluating whether  or to what extent  we will continue to offer this liability assumption program following our march ratings downgrade 
presently  we anticipate that it will be difficult to continue to provide these programs under an am best rating of b 
hurricane losses  property and reinsurance transactions and offerings we have incurred estimated net losses of approximately million relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma during the year ended december  these losses include net reinstatement premium expense of approximately million 
of these losses  million including reinstatement premium expense of approximately million occurred in our property reinsurance line  million including reinstatement premium incom e of approximately million occurred in our marine reinsurance lines  million including reinstatement premium expense of approximately million occurred in our technical risk property insurance line and million occurre d in our fidelity insurance product line 
we believe that we will not know our exact losses for some time given the uncertainty around the industry loss estimates  the size and complexity of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  limited claims data and potential legal and regulatory developments related to potential losses 
as a result  our losses may continue to develop during the next year and our ultimate losses may vary significantly from our recorded estimates 
below is a summary of the estimated losses and loss expenses incurre d for the hurricanes 
for the year ended december  gross losses ceded losses and loss and loss net los ses and expenses expenses loss e xpenses in thousands specialty insurance technical risk property    fidelity and crime specialty reinsurance marine  technical risk and aviation    property    total losses and loss expenses incurred    losses and loss expenses by event katrina and rita    wilma    reinstatement premiums katrina and rita    wilma net cost of hurricanes    the above table includes losses incurred from hurricanes katrina  rit a and wilma in and does not include development on losses incurred from the hurricanes 
we have recorded estimated gross losses of approximately million relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma during the year ended december  these losses include  and are net of  gross reinstatement premium income of approximately million 
the difference between our estimated gross and estimated net losses  of million  represents the amount of reinsurance or retrocessional insurance recoveries  including ceded reinstatement premium expense of million 
we obtained this reinsurance an d retrocessional insurance as part of our risk management practices to help limit our net loss exposures and control our aggregate exposures to particular classe s of risk including those related to natural catastrophe events 
we expect that the companies to which insurance has been ceded or reinsurance has been retroceded will be recoverable 
the average credit rating of these entities is rated a excellent by am best 
shortly after hurricane rita  we discontinued writing new and most renewal business in our technical risk property and property reinsurance lines of business 
we did not discontinue or make changes in our program businesses  including our residential builders and contractors program  which we refer to as the hbw program 
in addition  we retroceded substantially all the in force business  as of october   in these lines other than our program business by a portfolio transfer to a third party reinsurer  which we refer to as the property transaction 
the property transaction limits our property reinsurance and technical risk property losses occurring after october  to those relating to hurricane wilma and those we have incurred through september  including incurred but not reported losses  which includes losses relating to hurricanes katrina and rita 
under the property transaction  we also transferred all future premiums earned for that business and loss and acquisition expenses incurred from and after october  to the third party reinsurer 
effective october   we also commuted two of our casualty reinsurance treaties back to the insurance company which had reinsured it with us  which we refer to as the casualty reinsurance transaction 
we refer to the property transaction and the casualty reinsurance transaction collectively as the transactions 
the property reinsurance and technical risk property product lines subject to the property transaction accounted for gross premiums written and ne t premiums written of approximately million and million for the yea r ended december  and approximately million and million for the year ended december  the net premiums written of million for the year ended december  reflect million of ceded premiums writte n during the fourth quarter related to the property transaction 
our net underwriting losses for the product lines subject to the property transaction were approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  the two casualty reinsurance treaties subject to the casualty reinsurance transaction accounted for gross premiums written and net premiums written of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december   which is net o f million of net unearned premium returned to the insurance company under the terms of the casualty reinsurance transaction 
our net underwriting income relating to those two casualty reinsurance treaties was approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december   which includes the net expense of the casualt y reinsurance transaction of approximately million 
the impact of the transactions is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  on december   we issued  common shares at per share and  shares of our series a preferred shares at per share with a liquidation preference of per share 
the gross proceeds to the company were million before the payment of underwriting fees  of which million was from the sale of common shares and million was from the sale of preferred shares 
in addition  on december   the underwriters exercised a portion of their over allotment option to acquire additional series a preferred shares at the offering price of 
this resulted in the sale  on january  of  shares of our series a preferred shares for gros s proceeds of million 
am best rating actions  strategic alternatives and evaluation as a result of the expected losses from the hurricanes  on october   am best placed the a excellent financial strength ratin g assigned to quanta bermuda and its subsidiaries and quanta europe  under review with negative implications 
in response  during the fourth quarter of  we worked closely with am best on a plan designed to maintain our a rating  which included the retrocession of substantially all the in force business  as of october   in our technical risk property and property reinsurance lines of business other than our program business by a portfolio transfer to a third party reinsurer  the commutation o f two of our casualty reinsurance treaties back to the insurance company which ha d reinsured it with us and the completion of the offerings of our common shares and series a preferred shares in the fourth quarter of on december   am best affirmed the financial strength rating of a excellent of quanta bermuda and its subsidiaries  and ascribed a negative outlook to the rating 
am best defines a negative outlook as indicating that a company is experiencing unfavorable financial market trends  relative to its current ratin g level and  if continued  the company has a good possibility of having its ratin g downgraded 
in connection with am best s december affirmation of our ratings and continued review with negative outlook  am best cited significant challenges and uncertainties associated with the successful execution of management s revised business plans  management s ability to diversify and grow our business profitably  and the risk for upward development of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma losses 
on march   am best announced that it had downgraded the financial strength rating assigned to quanta bermuda and its subsidiaries and quanta europe  to b very good  under review with negative implications 
the am best a excellent rated lloyd s market  including our lloyd s syndicate  was not subject to the rating downgrade 
we believe that adverse developments during the fourth quarter of relating to the hurricane losses and our other reserve increases were significant contributors to the decision by am best 
based on our discussions with am best  in order to maintain our rating  we believe that we will be required to demonstrate acceptable results and change our business model appropriately to show that we can grow our business profitably 
this  however  will be very difficult to accomplish under a b rating 
in addition  we believe we will need to successfully implement a more favorable cost structure and reduce the amount of risk that we assume on a single loss event or catastrophic event based on initiatives that we have begun to implement 
we also believe that am best wil l continue to evaluate our available capital and the probable loss exposures associated with our business lines to ensure our capital is in compliance with am best s standards relative to our rating 
we intend to continue to work wit h am best to understand the different requirements it has for our business in order to maintain or improve our financial strength rating and remove any qualification to our rating 
however  the downgrade and qualification of our rating with negative implications has significantly adversely affected our business  our opportunities to write new and renewal business and our ability t o retain key employees 
based on the deterioration in our business  am best may further downgrade our financial strength ratings 
we can make no assurances as to what rating actions am best may take now or in the future or whether am best will further downgrade our rating or remove any qualification to our rating 
we expect the downgrade of our rating and qualification of our rating with negative implications to continue to have a significant adverse effect on our business 
currently  we are not writing new business in our professional liability  environmental and fidelity and crime product lines or in our reinsurance and structured products lines and we are running off our surety line 
we have also been removed from the approved listing of several of our important brokers  including aon corporation and marsh inc the downgrade of ou r financial rating or the continued qualification of our current rating continues to cause concern about our viability among brokers and other marketing sources  resulting in a movement of business away from us to other stronger or more highly rated carriers 
we believe the recent downgrade of our financial rating is also adversely affecting our lloyd s operations 
certain of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contai n termination rights triggered by the am best rating downgrade 
many of our other insurance contracts and certain of our reinsurance contracts provide for cancellation at the option of the policyholder regardless of our financial strength rating 
a cancellation typically results in the termination of the policy and our ongoing obligations and the return of premiums to our client tha t usually approximates our unearned premium reserve as of the date of the cancellation 
whether a client would exercise such rights would depend  among other things  on the reasons for the downgrade  the extent of the downgrade  th e prevailing market conditions  whether we have posted security in respect of our obligations and the pricing and availability of replacement coverage 
we cannot predict in advance how many of our clients will actually exercise such rights or the effect such cancellations wil l have on our financial condition or future prospects 
however  depending on the number of contracts involved  such an effect could be materially adverse 
as of march   we had received notice of cancellation on approximately of our in force policies  calculated using original contract gross premiums writte n related to those cancelled policies as a percentage of total gross premiums written during gross unearned premiums relating to these cancellations that we have returned or expect to return to our clients total approximately million 
we expect that we will receive additional cancellations 
many of our other insurance contracts and certain of our reinsurance contracts provide for cancellation at the option of the policyholder regardless of our financial strength rating  including those placed by the program manager of our hbw program 
hbw gross premiums written during the year ended december  totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was casualty premium  million was warranty premium and million was property premium  by class of risk 
hbw net premiums written during the year ended december  totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was casualty premium  million was warranty premium and million was property premium  by class of risk 
based on our discussions with the program manager  we understand that it will divert a substantial portion of the hbw program business to other carriers 
however  we expect to continue to write a small portion of the casualty business through ou r lloyd s syndicate 
we understand that the new carriers can begin writing casualty business in some states beginning in march  but will need time to file and obtain approval of rate and policy forms with regulatory authorities i n other states in which the program manager is writing 
until the new carriers ar e able to obtain these approvals  we will continue to write casualty business for the program manager 
other than the business that we intend to write through ou r lloyd s syndicate  we expect that substantially all of the hbw program business will be diverted to other carriers by december  consequently  we estimate that the gross and net premiums written under the hbw program during will be less than of the gross and net premiums written during while we expect to be able to continue to write business through our lloyd s syndicate  we expect that the premiums written under our hbw program during will be significantly less than as the hbw program manager is able to move that business to new carriers 
we are working diligently to implement key steps designed to preserve shareholder value and respond to the rating actions taken by am best 
a special committee of our board of directors has engaged friedman  billings  ramsey co  inc and jp morgan securities inc  as financial advisors  to assist us in evaluating strategic alternatives  including the potential sale of some or all of our businesses  the run off of certain product lines or the business or a combination of alternatives 
our financial advisors will also hel p us evaluate the potential use of excess capital to repay debt or to return valu e to our shareholders 
we are also closely analyzing our business lines  their positioning and internal operations  and identifying steps we should take to improve our position 
we believe that we currently have sufficient assets to pay our foreseen liabilities as they become due 
we maintain a global platform conducting business in the united states  bermuda and europe 
we also believe w e have strong underwriting capabilities and experience in key product lines 
we plan to continue to operate our environmental consulting services through esc and certain program business lines and to continue our operations through the am best a rated lloyd s market under our existing lloyd s syndicate 
we are evaluating whether we continue to operate our remaining business lines  which may include the use of strategic alliances  fronting agreements and other arrangements 
in connection with the evaluation of our business  we are also evaluating the possibility of expanding our business to help diversify our business mix and build our product lines along a middle market strategy that is supportable with a b rating and with customers who can benefit from our underwriting capabilities and risk management capacities 
this could include writing policies with lower limits and lower aggregate loss exposures and in markets we believe provide us a greater ability to deal with the broker or insured in establishing policy terms and managing particular claims 
we may see k to broaden the number of brokers we do business with  such as by targeting smaller regional brokers who represent smaller companies who can benefit from our underwriting capabilities and risk management capacities 
we may also seek to work with existing broker relationships to reach additional customers that we can serve 
prior to the recent am best action  we had begun taking steps to reduce our costs  including the reduction of personnel following the exit of ou r technical risk property and property reinsurance lines  and reducing certain infrastructure costs  such as the reduction of consulting costs  the reduction of our office space and consolidation of our personnel in bermuda 
in connectio n with our evaluation of our business lines  we have accelerated steps to reduce infrastructure costs and personnel expenses 
we believe that a more efficient expense structure is critical in allowing us to produce profitable results and more easily deploy our resources to those lines of business that become more attractive under our current am best ratings and as market conditions and our business change 
we have determined to run off our surety line 
we also will consider running off other selected lines as an alternative to sale of all or portions o f our business 
if our board of directors concludes that no other alternatives would be in the best interests of our shareholders  it may determine that the best alternative is to place all our insurance and reinsurance businesses in ru n off and eventually wind up our operations over some period of time  which is no t currently determinable 
if the run off alternative is selected  then during and future periods we expect to continue to pay losses and expenses as they become due and will continue to earn investment income on our investment portfolio 
we generated approximately million  million and million of net premiums written after premiums ceded on purchased reinsurance protection  which include the ceded premiums of million related to the property transaction referred to above  and million  million and million of net premiums earned during the years ended december   and during the year ended december   we also purchased additional retrocessional protection in our specialty reinsurance segment which is intended to help limit our net loss exposures to catastrophe windstorm events 
this purchase resulted in approximately million of premium ceded during the year ended december  however  based on our current estimate of losses related to hurricane katrina  we have exhausted our reinsurance and retrocessional protection with respect to that hurricane 
if our hurricane katrina losses prove to be greater than currently anticipated  we will have no further reinsurance and retrocessional coverage available for that windstorm 
the primary drivers of growth in in our insurance lines of business and net premiums written were the development of our relationships wit h insurance and reinsurance brokers and the development of our specialty insuranc e lines of business  including syndicate traditionally  many reinsurance contracts are entered into at the beginning of a calendar year and that period is often referred to as the january renewal season 
as we have exited most of our reinsurance business  we believe that the renewal season will be much less significant for our results 
our specialty insurance segment demonstrated premium growth during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   especially through lloyd s  following receipt of regulatory approvals during the fourth quarter of our specialt y insurance segment became a more significant contributor to our overall business and represented approximately of our total net premiums written in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  we believe that our portfolio is not diversified either among classes of risks or source of origination 
for example  during the year ended december   our hbw program accounted for approximately of our specialty insurance segment gross premiums written 
in addition  the hbw program and the other insurance programs we write  accounted for of our specialty insurance segment gross premiums written in the year ended december  a s described below  our specialty reinsurance segment showed significant concentrations across certain risk classes 
in addition  our specialty reinsurance segment generated approximately  and of its gross premiums written through three brokers 
the exit from our property reinsurance and technical risk property insurance line and the casualty reinsurance commutations  have further reduced our diversification in our product lines and will cause the concentrations across certain of our risk classes to increase 
further  as a result of the recent rating action by am best  we expect that concentrations in certain risk classes will increase as we evaluate and position our business 
we have determined that million of investment securities  with unrealized losses of approximately million were other than temporarily impaired as of december  the realization of these losses represents th e maximum amount of potential losses in our investment securities if we would hav e sold all of these securities at december  as a result of our decision  the affected investments were reduced to their estimated fair value  which becomes their new cost basis 
the recognition of the losses has no affect on ou r shareholders equity  the market value of our investments  our cash flows or ou r liquidity 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments requires the application of significant judgment  including our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for possible recovery 
we believe we have sufficient assets to pay our currently foreseen liabilities as they become due and we have no immediate intent to liquidate the investments securities affected by our decision 
however  due to the general uncertainties surrounding our business resulting from am best s march downgrade of our financial strength ratings and our decision to explore strategic alternatives  we concluded that there are no absolute assurances that we will have the abilit y to hold the affected investments for a sufficient period of time 
it is possibl e that the investment securities fair values could change in subsequent periods  resulting in further material impairment charges 
segment information we organize our business along five product lines and three geographies 
our two traditional product lines are specialty insurance and specialty reinsurance 
we also have programs and structured products product lines 
the products we offer our clients are written either as traditional insurance or reinsurance policies or are provided as a program  a structured product or a combination of a traditional policy with a program or a structured product 
our fifth product line is our technical services line 
however  for financial reporting purposes  some of our product lines are aggregated for purposes of the reportable segment disclosure included below o specialty insurance 
our specialty insurance segment includes our traditional  structured and program specialty insurance products 
our traditional specialty insurance products included in our specialty insurance segment result s include technical risk property  professional liability  environmental liability  fidelity and crime  surety  trade credit and political risk and marine and aviation 
during  our specialty insurance segment wrote business both o n a direct basis with insured clients or by reinsuring policies that are issued on our behalf by third party insurers and reinsurers  and includes our lloyd s syndicate which was created in december during the year ended december   we changed the composition of our reportable segments by aggregating the lloyd s operating segment with the specialty insurance reportable segment 
ou r lloyd s syndicate writes traditional specialty insurance products including professional liability professional indemnity and directors and officers coverage  fidelity and crime financial institutions and specie and fine art 
our specialty insurance programs include the hbw program 
after the end of the third quarter of  we discontinued the writing of new and most renewal business in our technical risk property line of business 
currently  we are not writing new business in our professional liability  environmental  and marine and aviation specialty insurance product lines and our structured products line and we are running off our surety line 
o specialty reinsurance 
our specialty reinsurance segment includes our traditional  structured and program specialty reinsurance products 
our specialty reinsurance products included in our specialty reinsurance segment results include property  casualty and marine and aviation products we currently do not write reinsurance on a program basis 
after the end of the third quarter of  we discontinued the writing of new and most renewal business in our property reinsuranc e of business and commuted a large portion of our casualty reinsurance portfolio 
currently  we are not writing new business in our remaining specialty reinsurance product lines 
o technical services 
our technical services segment provides diversified environmental investigation  remediation and engineering services  assessment services  other technical and information management services primarily in the environmental area in the us our technical services segment also provides technical and information management services to our specialty insurance and reinsurance segments 
the determination of these reportable segments reflects how we manage and monitor the performance of our insurance and reinsurance operations and may change from time to time 
we refer to the specialty insurance and specialty reinsurance segments as our underwriting segments 
we refer to our risk consulting and management operations as our technical services segment 
we evaluate each segment based on its underwriting or technical services results  as applicable  including items of revenue and expense that are associated with  and directly related to  each segment 
we allocate corporate general and administrative expenses to each segment based upon each product line s allocated capital for the current reporting period 
we allocate capital to each of our product lines through the estimated value at risk method  which uses statistical analyses of historical market trends and volatility to estimate the probable amounts of capital at ris k for each reporting period 
we do not manage our assets by segment and  as a result  net investment income  and depreciation and amortization are not evaluated at the segment level 
main drivers of our results revenues we derive the majority of our revenues from three principal sources premiums from policies written by our underwriting segments  technical services revenues and investment income from our investment portfolios 
we record premiums written at the time that there is sufficient evidence of agreement to the significant terms of the contract but no earlier than the effective date of the policy 
the amount of our insurance and reinsurance premiums written and earned depends on the number and type of policies we write  the amount of reinsurance protection we provide  as well as prevailing market prices 
furthermore  the amount of net premiums earned depend s upon the type of contracts we write  the contractual periods of the contracts w e write  the inception date of the contracts  the expired portions of the contrac t periods and the type of purchased reinsurance protection 
because of all these factors  the amount of premiums written and ceded may not result in a correlative level of profitability 
we also have revenues generated by our technical services segment  which operates primarily in the environmental area  from technical and risk management services provided under various short term service contracts and for services performed by subcontractors engaged on behalf of clients 
we also generate revenues from the remediation of environmental obligations that we hav e assumed 
the amount of technical services and remediation fees and subcontracto r revenues is a function of political and economic conditions and the impact thes e conditions have on clients discretionary spending on environmental projects 
our investment income depends on the average invested assets in our investment portfolios and the yield that we earn on those invested assets 
our investment yield is a function of market interest rates and the credit quality and maturity period of our invested assets 
our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed income securities  short term liquidity funds  cash  and cash equivalents 
in addition  we realize capital gains or losses on sales of investments as a result of changing market conditions  including changes in market interest rates and changes in the credit quality of our invested assets 
we also recognize capital losses on investments as a result of other than temporary impairment charges 
under us gaap  our available for sale investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses o n the investments included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensiv e income loss net of income taxes as a separate component of shareholders equity 
our trading investments that relate to deposits associated with non ris k bearing contracts are recorded at estimated fair value with the change in fair value included in net realized gains and losses on investments in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
the objective of our current investment strategy is to preserve investment principal  maintain liquidity and to manage duration risk between investment assets and insurance liabilities  while maximizing investment returns through a diversified portfolio 
our investment returns are benchmarked against certain specified indices 
however  the volatility in claim payments and the interest rate environment can significantly affect the returns we generate on our investment portfolios 
expenses our expenses primarily consist of net loss and loss expenses  general and administrative expenses  acquisition expenses and direct technical services costs 
net loss and loss expenses  which are net of loss and loss expenses recovered under our ceded reinsurance contracts  depend on the number and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts we write and reflect our best estimate o f ultimate losses and loss expenses we expect to incur on each contract written using various actuarial analyses 
actual losses and loss expenses will depend o n actual costs to settle insurance and reinsurance claims 
our ability to accurately estimate expected ultimate loss and loss expense at the time of pricing each insurance and reinsurance contract and the occurrence of unexpecte d high loss severity catastrophe events are critical factors in determining our profitability 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  information technology  other operating overheads and professional fees 
from time to time we engage administrative service providers and legal  accounting  tax and financial advisors 
general and administrative expenses are a function of the development of our business and infrastructure  including the growth in personnel and the volume of insurance and reinsurance contracts written 
these general and administrative expenses may be incurred directly by a segment or indirectly at the corporate level 
acquisition expenses  which are net of expenses recovered under our ceded reinsurance contracts  consist principally of commissions  fees  brokerag e and tax expenses that are directly related to obtaining and writing insurance and reinsurance contracts 
typically  acquisition expenses are based on a certain percentage of the premiums written on contracts of insurance and reinsurance 
these expenses are a function of the number and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts written 
we also incur expenses directly related to and arising from our technical services and environmental remediation activities 
these direct costs primarily include expenses associated with direct technical labor  subcontractors we engage on behalf of our technical services clients  and other technical services or remediation contract related expenses 
these costs are a function of  and are proportional to  the level of technical services and remediation revenues earned from the provision of technical services and completion of remediation activities 
financial ratios the financial ratios we use include the net loss and loss expense ratio  the acquisition expense ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio 
our net loss and loss expense ratio is calculated as net losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned 
because our underwriting portfolios continue to change significantly  we expect that our net loss ratios may continue to be volatile 
our acquisition expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition expenses by net premiums earned 
our net loss and loss expense ratio and acquisition expense ratio provide a measure of the current profitability of the earned portions of our written insurance and reinsurance contracts 
our general and administrative expense ratio is calculated by dividing underwriting related general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned and indicate s the level of indirect costs that we incur in acquiring and writing insurance an d reinsurance business 
during  we have changed the denominator to be used i n the calculation of our general and administrative expense ratio to net premiums earned  instead of net premiums written 
our combined ratio is the aggregate of our loss and loss expense  acquisition expense and general and administrative expense ratios 
we believe that these financial ratios appropriately reflect th e profitability of our underwriting segments 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit and over  an underwriting loss 
because w e have a limited operating history  our combined ratio may be subject to significant volatility and may not be indicative of future profitability 
results of operations the following is a discussion of quanta holdings consolidated result s of operations for the years ended december  and comparisons between the year ended december  and the period from may  date of incorporation to december  are not meaningful because we commenced substantive operations on september  and during the period from may  date of incorporation to december   we wrote only a small number of insurance and reinsurance contracts 
we separately provide a discussion for the period from may  date of incorporation to december  the discussion and analysis of quanta holdings results include the results of esc  our predecessor  from september   the date quanta holdings acquired esc  through december  esc is our predecessor for accounting purposes and its business is wholly attributable to the technical services segment 
accordingly  we compare the results of operations of esc for the year ended december  to the year ended december   and the year ended december  to the pro forma financial information for the year ended december  within the discussion of our technical services segment under results by segments 
years ended december  and december  results of operations for the years ended december  and were as follows in thousands revenues gross premiums written   net premiums written   net premiums earned   technical services revenues   net investment income   net realized losses gains on investments  net foreign exchange gains other income   total revenues   expenses net losses and loss expenses   acquisition expenses   direct technical services costs   general and administrative expenses   interest expense  depreciation and amortization of intangible assets   total expenses   income taxes net loss   revenues 
substantially all of our revenues were generated by our underwriting subsidiaries in the us  bermuda and europe 
technical services revenues were derived from the operations of esc  qlt buffalo llc and qlt of alabama  llc 
premiums 
gross premiums written were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our gross premiums written was largely due to the contribution of million  or of our gross premiums written  from our lloyd s syndicate  which commenced in december the increase also reflected continued growth in all of our specialty insurance segment product lines and our marine  technical risk and aviation product line in our specialty reinsurance segment 
shortly after hurricane rita  we discontinued writing new and most renewal business in our technical risk property and property reinsurance lines of business other than our program business  which accounted for approximately million  or  of our gross premium written during the year ended december  premiums ceded were million for the year ended december  an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in premiums ceded primarily reflects the growth in gross premiums written  approximately million of premiums ceded resulting from the property transaction and approximately million in purchased reinsurance and retrocessional protection including reinstatement premiums to help limit our net loss exposures to natural catastrophe events 
the increase of premiums ceded is attributable to a lesser extent to the development of the reinsurance program for our specialty insurance segment product lines  which was restructured during the year ended december  the restructure involved the commutation of our reinsurance treaty protection in our professional liability and fidelity product lines  which was ceded on an excess of loss basis 
the unexpired portions of this business were then transferred  effective april   into our reinsurance treaty  which is ceded on a proportional quota share basis 
net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting the growth in premiums written and the earning and amortization of premiums written and ceded during the years ended december  and our net premiums written are typically earned over the risk periods of the underlying insurance policies which are generally twelve months 
net premiums written that are not yet earned and are deferred as unearned premium reserves  net of deferred reinsurance premiums  totaled million at december  and will be earned and recognized in our results o f operations in future periods 
because we only began to write insurance and reinsurance business during the fourth quarter of and because our lloyd s syndicate commenced operations in december  we believe that our net premiums earned are not representative of a fully developed and diversified portfolio of insurance and reinsurance contracts 
technical services revenues 
technical services revenues were million for the year ended december  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in technical services revenues is primarily attributable to increased remediation revenues associated with our liability assumption program in buffalo  new york 
net investment income and net realized losses gains 
net investment income and net realized losses gains totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to an increase in net investment income of million because of our larger amount of invested assets and rises in market interest rates  which is offset b y an increase in net realized losses of million  of which million is attributable to other than temporary impairment losses recognized during the year ended december  net investment income was million for the year ended december  and was derived primarily from interest earned on fixed maturity and short term investments  partially offset by investment management fees and amortization of discounts on fixed maturity investments 
our average annualized effective yield calculated by dividing net investment income by the average amortized cost of invested assets  net of amounts payable or receivable for investments purchased or sold was approximately for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   reflecting rises in market interest rates 
net realized losses of million were generated primarily from our other than temporary impairment charge of million and also as we sought to manage our total investment returns and the duration of our investment portfolios 
as of december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately years with an average credit rating of approximately aa

net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses were million for the year ended december  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  net losses and loss expenses are a function of our net premiums earned and our expected ultimate losses and loss expenses for reported and unreported claims o n contracts of insurance and reinsurance underwritten 
the increase in net losses and loss expenses is due to o the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts we entered int o and the associated net premiums earned as our insurance and reinsurance portfolios continue to mature  o the increase in loss occurrences  particularly those related to the hurricanes and the first quarter rupture of an oil pipeline in california during a mudslide  and o general reserve strengthening relating primarily to our hbw program  lloyd s  professional and environmental lines 
included in our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  are specific loss estimates on contracts of reinsurance and insurance insuring claims arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our preliminary loss estimates for the hurricanes based on currently available information totals million including reinstatement premiums  of which million is included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  compared to million included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our estimate of our exposure to ultimate claim costs associate d with these hurricanes is primarily based on currently available information  claims notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a review of affected contracts and discussion with cedents and brokers 
the actual amount of losses from the hurricanes may vary significantly from the estimate 
our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  also include estimated gross and net loss estimates of million and million related to damage caused by an oil pipeline in california which rupture d during a mudslide in the first quarter of  for which the damage is covered by an insurance contract issued by our environmental liability product line 
there remains the possibility of further negative development on this loss in the future  particularly if the timing of the completion of the remediation pla n for the spill is further delayed 
in addition to the hurricanes and the oil pipeline loss  as of december   we have received a limited amount of significant reported losses 
however  we participate in lines of business where claims may not be reported for some period of time after those claims are incurred 
we have used the bornhuetter ferguson reserving method as our primary loss reserving methodology as of december  to estimate the ultimate cos t of losses for our specialty reinsurance lines and our fidelity and technical risk property specialty insurance lines 
the bornhuetter ferguson reserving method uses an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio supplemented by our actual loss and loss expense experience to date 
we have used an expected loss ratio method as our primary reserving methodology as of december  to estimate the ultimate cost of losses for our other specialty insurance business lines  whereby earned premiums are multiplied by an expected loss ratio to derive ultimate losses and deducts any paid losses and loss expenses to arrive at estimated losses and loss expense reserves 
with respect to the year ended december   in establishing our reserves for losses and loss expenses  w e reviewed reserve estimates of an actuary employed with our company and of an external actuary specialist 
we recorded these reserves as of the year ended december  based on the highest aggregate reserve amount of the estimate s we reviewed 
as part of our year end closing process  we strengthened our loss reserves for by approximately million 
given the immaturity of our business and very limited claims history  we have relied on pricing  loss and expense data accumulated by our consulting actuary  historical industry results and to a limited extent  our own reported claims history in establishing loss ratios for each line of business 
although we have not experienced significant reported claims in our casualty insurance line  we have worked closely with our independent loss specialist and concluded to generally strengthen our loss ratios in our hbw program  lloyd s and environmental lines with respect to the year ended december  our total net loss ratio calculated by dividing net losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned was for the year ended december  an increase of compared to a total net loss ratio of for the year ended december  the increase in the total net loss ratio is due both t o the greater magnitude of the hurricanes that occurred in the second half of as compared to those that occurred in the third quarter of and to the oil pipeline loss 
however  the extent of the impact of the actual catastrophes in was mitigated by our purchased reinsurance and retrocessional protection and increased net premiums earned compared to the year ended december  we received a claim under our pwib program relating to tornados occurring in march due to the fact that we very recently received this claim  we are still in the process of estimating the amount of losses relating to this claim that we will need to recognize in our financial statement for the first quarter of acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in acquisition expenses is due to the increase in the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
our acquisition expense ratio for the year ended december  wa s  a decrease of compared to our acquisition expense ratio of fo r the year ended december  the decrease is due to four factors 
first  during  our earned premium was more heavily weighted towards specialty insurance  which carries lower acquisition costs than specialty reinsurance 
second  we are paying less fronting costs on our specialty insurance lines because we are licensed in more states and no longer need to utilize fronting companies to the same extent in order to write our business 
third  our ceding commission income that we are recovering on our specialty insurance segment s reinsurance treaties increased during as a result of the restructuring of those treaties during the second quarter of finally  we paid less commission in our hbw program during because the contracts contain sliding scale commission provisions that vary with changes in the selected loss ratio 
deferred acquisition costs include  as of december   million of acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance and reinsurance that wil l be amortized in future periods as the premiums written to which they relate are earned

to a lesser extent  the increase is attributed to increases in auditing fees  fees associated with ongoing efforts relating to sarbanes oxley section compliance and costs relating to information technology development 
general and administrative expenses related to our underwriting segment was million for the year ended  which included million of expenses charged by our technical services segment for technical and information management services  and million of expenses related to our technical services segment 
our general and administrative expense ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due to the additional number of employees hired and developmen t of our infrastructure as we grew our lines of business during and also due to the impact of the transactions that lowered net earned premiums 
in  we have changed the denominator in the calculation of our general and administrative expense ratio to net premiums earned  instead of net premiums written

our average annualized effective yield calculated by dividing net investment incom e by the time weighted average amortized cost of invested assets for the period from september  private offering to december  was approximatel y 
initially our invested assets were held entirely in cash  liquidity funds and overnight cash deposits 
in october  we and our asset managers established an investment program to invest in a broader array of assets such a s fixed income securities  in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors 
as a result  our annualized effective yield s have increased through as we moved the majority of our invested assets int o longer term fixed income securities and similar instruments

results by segments underwriting we principally provide insurance and reinsurance protection for risks that are often unusual or difficult to place  that do not fit the underwriting criteria of standard commercial product carriers and that require extensive technical underwriting and assessment resources in order to be profitably underwritten 
in measuring the performance of our specialty insurance and specialty reinsurance segments  we consider each segment s net underwriting income and a number of financial ratios 
net underwriting income is the sum of net premiums earned less net losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and direct and allocated general and administrative expenses 
we allocate indirect corporate general and administrative expenses among each of our segments  including those related to underwriting operations  as described above under segment information 
during the year ended december   we changed the composition o f our reportable segments to aggregate the lloyd s operating segment with our specialty insurance reportable segment 
we aggregated these segments to reflect that we operate these insurance businesses as one and that the lloyd s business is very similar to the insurance business we write in the united states 
our lloyd s operations were previously reported as a separate segment

however  shortly after hurricane rita  we discontinued writing new and most renewal business in our technical risk property line of business other than our program business  which accounted for approximately million  or  of our specialty insurance segment s gross premiums written during the year ended december  we also retroceded substantially all the in force business  as of october   in this line other than our program business by a portfolio transfer to a third party reinsurer

consequently  only million of reinsurance premiums written were earned during the period reflecting the short time period between contract inception and our year end 
for the period ended december  we did not write any other reinsurance business 
net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses incurred o f million reflect a loss and loss expense ratio of

technical services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in technical services revenues is primarily attributable to increased remediation revenues associated with liability transfer project in buffalo  new york 
during the year ended december   our liability assumption program in buffalo generated revenues of million and other income of million other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  compared to million for th e year ended december  the increase was primarily generated from our liability assumption program in buffalo  new york 
this income primarily represents the amount of consideration received for the assumption of remediation liabilities in excess of the expected environmental remediation liability which is initially deferred in the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently recognized in earnings over the remediation period using the cost recovery or percentage of completion method 
direct technical services costs 
direct technical services costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in direct technical services costs was primarily attributabl e to increased direct subcontractor expenses which resulted from the buffalo  new york remediation project undertaken during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  direct technical services costs  as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   reflecting the increase d usage of subcontractors for environmental projects in as compared to general and administrative expenses

year ended december  compared to period from september  to december  and period from january  to september  the following table summarizes and compares our technical services segment results for the year ended december  and  on a pro forma basis  the year ended december  substantially all of these results were generated by the operations of our predecessor  esc 
the pro forma technical services segment results for the year ended december  are derived from the aggregation of segment results for the period from september  to december  and the segment results of esc for the period january  to september  the date of our acquisition of esc 
we believe that our comparative discussion on this pro forma basis provides a more meaningful analysis of the results of the technical services segment

the increase in subcontractor revenue during the year ended december  was the result of an increase in subcontractor remediation activity 
the increase in direct labor revenue is a result of an increase in client spending on environmental projects 
other income 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  compared to million for th e pro forma year ended december  the increase was primarily generated from our liability assumption program under which we assume specified environmental liabilities

direct technical services costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the pro forma year ended december  the increase in direct technical services costs was primarily attributabl e to increased subcontractor expenses which resulted from an increase in the number  and change in the nature of  remediation projects undertaken during the year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december  direct technical services costs  as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the pro forma year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
direct and indirect allocated general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or compared to million for the pro forma year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a general increase in underlying general and administrative expenses and increased salary and benefit expense related to hiring additional staff during the year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december  financial condition and liquidity quanta holdings is organized as a bermuda holding company  and as such  has no direct operations of its own 
our assets consist of investments in our subsidiaries through which we conduct substantially all of our insurance  reinsurance and technical services operations 
as of december   we had operations in the us  bermuda  ireland and the us  including syndicate as a holding company  we will have continuing funding needs for general corporate expenses  the payment of principal and interest on current an d future borrowings  dividends on our preferred shares  taxes  and the payment of other obligations 
funds to meet these obligations will come primarily from dividends  interest and other statutorily permissible payments from our operating subsidiaries 
the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make payments to quanta holdings is limited by the applicable laws and regulations o f the domiciles in which the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations subject our subsidiaries to significant restrictions and require  among other things  that some of our subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements an d limit the amount of dividends that these subsidiaries can pay to us 
rating agency considerations also limit our ability to transfer capital allocated amon g our insurance operating subsidiaries 
additionally  there are significant restrictions regarding our ability to remove the funds deposited to support our underwriting capacity of our lloyd s syndicate 
for further information regarding these restrictions  see item business regulation and notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  there are restrictions on our ability to transfer substantially all of the investment balances of our insurance subsidiaries to quanta holdings 
we are also subject to constraints under the companies act that affec t our ability to pay dividends on our shares 
we may not declare or pay a dividen d or make a distribution if we have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or will after the payment be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets will thereby be less than the aggregat e of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts 
as a result of our losses  for bermuda company law purposes  we expect that the realizable value of our assets will no longer exceed the aggregate of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts 
in order for quanta holdings to have the flexibility to pay dividends to shareholders  w e are evaluating a proposal to reduce the share premium account and allocate sums to our contributed surplus account 
we estimate that we currently have investments of approximately  million  including cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million 
we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances include approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
after giving effect to these assets pledged or placed in trust  we estimate tha t we presently have net investments of million  including net cash and cas h equivalents of approximately million 
substantially all of our capital has been distributed among our rated operating subsidiaries based on our assessment of the levels of capital that we believe are prudent to support our business  the applicable regulatory requirements  and the recommendations of th e insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
we believe our operating subsidiaries have sufficient assets to pay their respective currently foreseen liabilities as they become due 
we also believe that our operating subsidiaries can distribute sufficient funds to quanta holdings to enable to pay its currently foreseen liabilities as they become due  subject to the constraints under the companies act that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares as described above 
some of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contain termination rights that are triggered by the am best rating downgrade 
some o f these insurance and reinsurance contracts also require us to post additional security 
further  a downgrade in our rating below b very good will trigger termination provisions or require the posting of additional security in certain of our other insurance and reinsurance contracts 
as a result  we may b e required to post additional security either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
in addition  many of our insurance contract s and certain of our reinsurance contracts provide for cancellation at the option of the policyholder regardless of our financial strength rating 
accordingly  w e may also elect to post security under these other contracts in order to maintai n that business 
we estimate that we currently have net cash and cash equivalent balances and other investments of approximately million that are available to post as security or place in trust 
we currently believe that we have sufficient assets to pay our foreseen liabilities as they become due and meet our foreseen collateral requirements 
however  we cannot draw letters of credit or borrow under the credit agreement if we have incurred a material adverse effect or if a default exists under the agreement 
a downgrade in our rating below b very good will cause a default in our credit facility 
the obligations under the credit facility are currently fully secured by investment s and cash 
if a default occurs under the credit agreement  our lenders may require us to cash collateralize a portion or all of the outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility  which may be accomplished through the substitution or liquidation of collateral 
the lenders would also have the right  among other things  to cancel outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
if we fail to maintain or enter into adequate letter of credit facilities on a timely basis  we would be required to place securities in trust or similar arrangements  which would be more difficult and costly to establish and administer 
financial condition our board of directors established our investment policies and create d guidelines for hiring external investment managers 
management implements our investment strategy with the assistance of the external managers 
our investmen t guidelines specify minimum criteria on the overall credit quality  liquidity an d risk return characteristics of our investment portfolio and include limitations on the size of particular holdings  as well as restrictions on investments in different asset classes 
the board of directors monitors our overall investment returns and reviews compliance with our investment guidelines 
our investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize total return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
investment decision making is guided mainly by the natur e and timing of our expected liability payouts  management s forecast of our cash flows and the possibility that we will have unexpected cash demands  for example  to satisfy claims due to catastrophic losses 
our investment portfolio currently consists mainly of highly rated and liquid fixed income securities 
however  to the extent our insurance liabilities are correlated with an asset class outside our minimum criteria  our investment guidelines will allow a deviation from those minimum criteria provided such deviations reduce overall risk 
we have determined that million of investment securities  with unrealized losses of approximately million were other than temporarily impaired as of december  the realization of these losses represents the maximum amount of potential losses in our investment securities if we would have sold all of these securities at december  as a result of our decision  the affected investments were reduced to their estimated fair value  which becomes their new cost basis 
the recognition of the losses has no affect on our shareholders equity  the market value of our investments  our cash flows or our liquidity 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairment s requires the application of significant judgment  including our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for possible recovery 
we believe we have sufficient assets to pay our currently foreseen liabilities as they become due and we have no immediate intent to liquidate the investments securities affected by our decision 
however  due to the general uncertainties surrounding our business resulting from am best s march downgrade of our financial strength ratings and our decision to explore strategic alternatives  we concluded that there are no absolute assurances that we will have the ability to hold the affected investments for a sufficient period of time 
it is possible that the investment securities fair values could change in subsequent periods  resulting in further material impairment charges 
our investment guidelines require compliance with applicable local regulations and laws 
without board approval  we will not purchase financial futures  forwards  options  swaps and other derivatives  except for instruments that are purchased as part of our business  for purposes of hedging capital market risks including those within our structured products transactions  or as replication transactions  which are defined as a set of derivative  insurance and or securities transactions that when combined produce the equivalent economic results of an investment meeting our investment guidelines 
while we expect tha t the majority of our investment holdings will be denominated in us dollars  we may make investments in other currency denominations depending upon the currencies in which loss reserves are maintained  or as may be required by regulation or law 
our available for sale investments  excluding trading investments related to deposit liabilities  totaled million as of december  compared to million at december  the market value of our total investment portfolio was million  of which million related to available for sale fixed maturity investments  million related to available for sale short term investments and million to trading investments related to deposit liabilities 
the majority of our investment portfolio consists of fixed maturity investments which are managed by the following external investment advisors pacific investment management company llc  jp morgan investment management inc and deutsche asset management 
custodians of our externally managed investment portfolios are jp morgan chase bank na  citibank na and comerica incorporated 
our investment guidelines require that the average credit quality of the investment portfolio is typically aa aa and that no more than of the investment portfolio s market value shall be invested in securities rated below baa bbb 
as of december   all of the fixed maturity investments were investment grade  with a weighted average credit rating of aa based on ratings assigned by s p 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million a s of december  compared to million at december  the increase in our available for sale investments and cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the net proceeds raised from the sale of our common shares and preferred shares of million in december  the growth in our premiums written during the year ended december   the issuance of million of junior subordinated debentures  and million proceeds from the sale of a mortality risk linked security  partially offset by claims notifications and associated loss payments we have made up to and including december  our insurance and reinsurance premiums receivable balances totaled million as of december  compared to million at december  the decrease in premiums receivable reflects our decision to discontinue writing new and renewal business in our property reinsurance and technical risk property lines of business during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by our growth across the specialty insurance segment during th e year ended december  included in our premiums receivable are approximately million of written premium installments that are not yet currently due under the terms of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts 
as of december   based on our review of the remaining balanc e of million  which represents premiums installments that are currently due we believe there are no individually significant balances that are delinquent o r uncollectible 
our deferred acquisition costs and unearned premiums  net of deferred reinsurance premiums  totaled million and million  respectively  a s of december  compared to million and million as of decembe r  the decrease in our deferred acquisition costs during the year ended december  is due to the ceding commission income that we are recovering on our specialty insurance segments reinsurance treaties and as a result of recovering commission income from the third party reinsurer under the property transaction 
the increase in unearned premiums  net of deferred reinsurance  is due to the growth in our premiums written during the year ended december   which is in part offset by an increase in deferred reinsurance premiums a s a result of the ceding of premiums from the third party reinsurer under the property transaction 
these amounts represent premiums and acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance and reinsurance that will be recognized in earnings in future periods 
substantially all of these amounts will be recognized over the next months 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance recoverable  totaled million as december  compared t o million as of december  the increase in our net loss and loss expense reserves reflects the growth in our business  the associated insured risks we assumed during the year ended december  and include ou r estimate of ultimate unpaid net loss expenses totaling million relating t o hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  our remaining unpaid loss expenses totaling million relating to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne and million relating to the environmental claim that we incurred during the year ended december  the increase also represents general strengthening of our loss reserves for by approximately million as part of our year end closing process 
given the immaturity of our business and very limited claims history  we have relied on pricing  loss and expense data accumulated by our consulting actuary  historical industry results  and to a limited extent  our own reported claims history in establishing loss ratios for each line of business 
although we have not experienced significant reported claims in our casualty insurance line  we have worked closely with our independent loss specialist and concluded to generally strengthen our loss ratios in our hbw program  lloyd s  professional and environmental lines with respect to the year ended december  our estimate of our unpaid exposure to ultimate claim costs associated with these losses is based on currently available information  claim notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a review of affected contracts and discussion with clients  cedants and brokers 
the actual amount of future loss payments relating to thes e loss events may vary significantly from this estimate 
as of december  we have received a limited amount of other reported losses 
however  we participate in lines of business where claims may not be reported for some period of time after those claims are incurred 
a description of the method we use to determine our loss reserves is included above under results of operations 
our estimate of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  of million is net of reinsurance recoverable of million 
the increase in our reinsurance recoverable balance reflects th e growth in our business  and includes our estimate of unpaid loss expenses recoverable totaling million relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and million relating to the environmental claim that we incurred during the year ended december  our estimate of our reinsurance recoverable balance associated with these losses is based on currently availabl e information  claim notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a detailed review of affected ceded reinsurance contracts and an assessment of the credit risk to which the company is subject 
the actual amount of future loss payments relating to these loss events may var y significantly from this estimate

our shareholders equity was million as of december  compared to million as of december   reflecting a decrease of million that was primarily the result of a net loss of million for the year ended december  partially offset by the net proceeds from the common shares issued during december of million and a net change in unrealized gains on our investment portfolios of million 
as of december   we have provided a cumulative valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
these deferred tax assets were generated primarily from net operating losses 
as a start up company with limited operating history  the realization of these deferred tax assets is neither assured nor accurately determinable 
on december   we issued  shares of our series a preferred shares at per share with a liquidation preference of pe r share 
the gross proceeds to the company were million 
the series a preferred shares are reflected as redeemable preferred shares on our balance sheet as of december  upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  the holders of our serie s a preferred shares will be entitled to receive from our assets legally availabl e for distribution to shareholders a liquidation preference of per share  plu s declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date fixed for distribution 
dividends on our series a preferred shares will be payable on a non cumulative basis only when  as and if declared by our board of directors  quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of march  june  september and decembe r of each year  commencing on march  dividends declared on our series a preferred shares will be payable at a rate equal to of the liquidation preference per annum equivalent to per share 
on and after december   we may redeem our series a preferred shares  in whole or in part  at any time  at the redemption price set forth in the certificate of designation relating to preferred shares  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption 
we may not redeem our series a preferred shares before december  except that we may redeem our series a preferred shares before that date pursuant to certai n tax redemption provisions described in the certificate of designation 
if we experience a change of control  we may be required to make offers to redeem our series a preferred shares at a price of per share  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption and on the terms described in the certificate of designation 
our series a preferre d shares have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into any of our other securities or property 
liquidity operating cashflow  cash and cash equivalents we generated net operating cash flow of approximately million during the year ended december   primarily related to premiums and investment income received and offset by losses and loss expenses as well as general and administrative expenses paid 
in addition  we also generated net proceeds from the issuance of our common shares and preferred shares of million and net proceeds from the february issuance of junior subordinated debt securities of million 
during the same period  we invested net cash of million in our investment assets 
our cash flows from operations for the year ended december  provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements during that period 
we estimate that we currently have investments of approximately  million  including cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million 
we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances include approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
after giving effect to these assets pledged or placed in trust  we estimate tha t we presently have net investments of million  including net cash and cas h equivalents of approximately million 
we believe our operating subsidiaries currently have sufficient assets to pay their respective foreseen liabilities as they become due 
we also believe that our operating subsidiaries can distribute sufficient funds to quanta holdings to enable quanta holdings to pay its currently foreseen liabilities as they become due  subject to the constraints under the companies act that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares 
sources of cash our sources of cash consist primarily of existing cash and cash equivalents  premiums written  proceeds from sales and redemptions of investmen t assets  capital or debt issuances  investment income  reinsurance recoveries  and  to a lesser extent  our secured bank credit facility and collections of receivables for technical services rendered to third parties 
as a result of ou r recent ratings downgrade by am best  the resulting loss of business and business opportunities  our decision to currently cease writing new business in many of our product lines and pending termination of our agreement with the program manager of the hbw program  cash flows associated with the receipt of premiums will decrease substantially in on december   the company issued  common shares at per share and  shares of our series a preferred shares at per share with a liquidation preference of per share 
the gross proceeds to the company were million  of which million was from the sale of common shares and million was from the sale of preferred shares 
in addition  on december   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to acquire an additional  series a preferred shares at the offering price of per share 
this resulted in gross proceeds of million which were received and recorded on january  the proceeds from both the common shares offering and series a preferred shares offering will be used for general corporate purposes 
on july   quanta holdings and certain designated insurance subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  dated july   providing for a secured bank letter of credit facility and a revolvin g credit facility with a syndicate of lenders in the amount of million 
up t o million may be borrowed under the facility on a revolving basis for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements 
the facility is secured by specified investments of the borrowers 
we have approximately million of secured letters of credit issued and outstanding under the facility 
we have no t made any borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the obligations under the credit facility are currently fully secured by investments and cash 
the availability to a borrower is based on the amount of eligible investments pledged by that borrower 
regulatory restrictions will also limit the amount of investments that may be pledged by our us insurance borrowers and  consequently  the amount available for letters of credit and borrowings under the facility to those borrowers 
in addition  we cannot draw letters of credit or borrow under the credit agreement if we have incurred a material adverse effect or if a default exists under the agreement 
the credit agreement has certain financial covenants  including a leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capital of not greater than to  a minimum consolidated net worth of at least million which shall be increased immediately following the last day of each fiscal quarter by an amount equal to of the net income of the company and its subsidiaries and maintenance of the company s insurance ratings 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain covenants restricting the activities of quanta holdings and its subsidiaries  such as the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens and dividends and other payments to quanta holdings 
a ratings downgrade below b would also create an event of default under the credit agreement 
if a default occurs under the credit agreement  our lenders may require us to cash collateralize a portion or all of the outstandin g letters of credit issued under the facility  which may be accomplished through the substitution or liquidation of collateral 
the lenders would also have the right  among other things  to cancel outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
quanta holdings has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed al l of the obligations of its subsidiaries to the lenders 
the facility terminates on july  on december   we participated in a private placement of million of floating rate capital securities issued by quanta capital statutory trust i quanta trust i  a subsidiary delaware trust formed on december  the trust preferred securities mature on march   are redeemable a t our option at par beginning march   and require quarterly distributions of interest by quanta trust i to the holder of the trust preferred securities 
distributions will be payable at a variable per annum rate of interest  reset quarterly  equal to the london interbank offered rate libor rate plus basis points 
quanta trust i used the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities and the issuance of its common securities to purchase million of junior subordinated debt securities  due march   in the principal amount of million issued by us the trust i debentures 
on february   we participated in a private placement of million of floating rate capital securities issued by quanta capital statutory trust ii quanta trust ii  a subsidiary delaware trust formed on february the trust preferred securities mature on september   are redeemable at our option at par beginning september   and require quarterly distributions of interest by quanta trust ii to the holder of the trust preferred securities

quanta trust ii used the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities and the issuance of its common securities to purchase million of junior subordinated debt securities  due march   in the principal amount of million issued by us the trust ii debentures and  together with the trust i debentures  the debentures 
uses of cash and liquidity we estimate that we currently have investments of approximately  million  including cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million 
we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances include approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
after giving effect to these assets pledged or placed in trust  we estimate tha t we presently have net investments of million  including net cash and cas h equivalents of approximately million 
substantially all of our capital has been distributed among our rated operating subsidiaries based on our assessment of the levels of capital that we believe are prudent to support our business  the applicable regulatory requirements  and the recommendations of th e insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
some of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contain termination rights that are triggered by the am best rating downgrade 
some o f these insurance and reinsurance contracts also require us to post additional security 
as a result  we may be required to post additional security either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
we may also elect to post security under other insurance contracts in order to maintain tha t business 
we estimate that we currently have net cash and cash equivalent and investment balances of approximately million that are available to post as security or place in trust 
if am best downgrades our financial strength ratings below our current rating of b  we will be in default under our credit agreement 
we cannot draw letters of credit or borrow under our existing credit agreement if we have incurred a material adverse effect or if a default exists under the agreement 
if we fail to maintain or enter into adequate letter of credit facilities on a timely basis  we may be unable to provide necessary security to cedent companies under our existing retrocessional and reinsurance contracts that have the right to require the posting of additional security by reason of the downgrade of our am best rating 
we cannot assure you that we will be abl e to increase the commitment under our existing bank credit facility or obtain additional credit facilities at terms acceptable to us 
our inability to maintain or enter into adequate credit facilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the obligations under the credit facility are currently fully secured 
if a default occurs under the credit agreement  ou r lenders may require us to cash collateralize a portion or all of the outstandin g letters of credit issued under the facility  which may be accomplished through the substitution or liquidation of collateral 
the lenders would also have the right  among other things  to cancel outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
if we fail to maintain or enter into adequate letter of credit facilities on a timely basis  we would be required to place securities in trust or similar arrangements  which would be more difficult and costly to establish and administer 
in the near term  our other principal cash requirements are expected to be investments in operating subsidiaries  losses and loss adjustment expense s and other policy holder benefits  brokerage and commissions  expenses to develo p and implement our business strategy  including potential severance payments  other operating expenses  premiums ceded  capital expenditures  the servicing o f borrowing arrangements including the debentures  dividend payments on our series a preferred shares  and taxes 
the potential for a large claim under one of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that we may need to make substantial and unpredictable payments within relatively short periods of time 
as a result of the recent downgrade of our financial strength ratings by am best  we are closely analyzing our business lines  positioning in the market an d internal operations and identifying steps we should take to preserve shareholde r value and improve our position  including the exploration of strategic alternatives 
we may incur substantial costs  including severance payments  in connection with the implementation of any changes based on such analysis 
these initiatives and their implementation also involve significant uncertainties and risks that may result in restructuring charges and unforeseen expenses and costs associated with exiting lines of business and complications or delays  including  among others things  the risk of failure 
we estimate that severance charges that will be incurred in the first quarter of will be approximately million 
additionally  in order to retain the services of our chief financial officer  jonathan jr dodd  and a number of other key employees  we have entered into retention agreements with these employees that provide for specified severance payments in the event of termination without cause or following a change of control 
in the event of payout to all employees covered by these retention agreements  our cash requirements would include a total payment of approximatel y million to all such employees 
we paid additional gross claims of million during relatin g to the environmental claim and the hurricane events of and we expect that our cash requirements for the payment of these and other claims will be significant in future periods as we receive and settle claims  including those relating to these specific claims and in particular  claims related to the hurricanes that occurred in as a result of our recent ratings downgrade by am best  lloyd s has informed us that in order for syndicate to continue underwriting in the lloyd s of london market during the underwriting year  syndicate must diversify its capital base with one or more third party capital sources 
this capital  including the third party source  must be in place by november  based on the amount of capital provided by any third party source  we believe we will be able to remove some of the funds we have deposited to suppor t our underwriting capacity of our lloyd s syndicate 
however  we can make no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining any third party source of capital to support our lloyd s syndicate 
if we fail to meet lloyd s capital diversification requirements by november   we will no longer be able to participate in the lloyd s of london market in future underwriting years  which will have a material adverse effect on our business 
we incurred capital expenditures of million during the year ende d december  related primarily to the purchase and development of information technology assets 
as we are currently closely analyzing our business lines and our position  and exploring strategic alternatives  we are unable at this time to quantify the amount of future capital expenditures we ma y incur 
in addition to these cash requirements  under the purchase agreement with esc  we will be required to pay esc s former shareholders an earn out payment of million 
we may also have substantial liabilities to clients  third parties and government authorities for property damage  personal injuries breach of contract or breach of warranty claims  fines and penalties and regulatory action that could adversely affect our business arising from the assessment  analysis and assumption of environmental liabilities  and the management  remediation  and engineering of environmental conditions constitute a significant portion of our technical services business 
from time to time  we have offered a liability assumption program under which a special purpose entit y assumes specified liabilities associated with environmental conditions for whic h we provide technical services  which may be insured or guaranteed by us 
these businesses involve significant risks  including the possibility that we may hav e substantial liabilities to clients  third parties and governmental authorities for property damage  personal injuries  breach of contract or breach of warrant y claims  fines and penalties and regulatory action that could adversely affect our business 
while insurance regulation differs by location  each jurisdiction requires that minimum levels of capital be maintained in order to write new insurance business 
factors that affect capital requirements generally include premium volume  the extent and nature of loss and loss expense reserves  the type and form of insurance and reinsurance business underwritten and the availability of reinsurance protection from adequately rated retrocessionaires on terms that are acceptable to us 
additionally  we seek to capitalize our insurance operations in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements so that w e may maintain our current financial ratings from am best 
these regulatory and rating agency requirements restrict the amount of capital we are able to distribute to quanta holdings and other insurance subsidiaries 
for further discussion  see adequacy of regulatory and rating capital 
substantially all of our capital has been distributed among ou r rated operating subsidiaries based on our assessment of the levels of capital that we believe are prudent to support our expected levels of business  the applicable regulatory requirements  and the recommendations of the insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
we are subject to large losses  including those relating to the hurricanes 
since the timing and amount of losses from such exposures is unknown  we invest our assets so that should an event occur  we would have sufficient liquidity to pay claims on the underlying contracts 
as of december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately years with an average credit rating of approximately aa 
if a default occurs under the credit agreement  our lenders may require us to cash collateralize a portion or all of the outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility  which may be accomplished through the substitution or liquidation of collateral these events may cause us to incur capital losses 
should additional loss event s actually occur  we believe we have dedicated assets  including cash equivalents and other short term investments  in such a manner that cash would be on hand t o pay those claims 
as a result of these steps  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet the currently foreseen need of our clients 
we also believe our operating subsidiaries have sufficient assets to pay their respective currently foreseen liabilities as they become due 
we also believe that our operating subsidiaries can distribute sufficient funds to quanta holdings to enable quanta holdings to pay its currently foreseen liabilities as they become due  subject to the constraints under the companies act that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares 
we have determined that million of investment securities  with unrealized losses of approximately million were other than temporarily impaired as of december  the realization of these losses represents th e maximum amount of potential losses in our investment securities if we would hav e sold all of these securities at december  as a result of our decision  the affected investments were reduced to their estimated fair value  which becomes their new cost basis 
the recognition of the losses has no affect on ou r shareholders equity  the market value of our investments  our cash flows or ou r liquidity 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments requires the application of significant judgment  including our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for possible recovery 
we believe we have sufficient assets to pay our currently foreseen liabilities as they become due and we have no immediate intent to liquidate the investments securities affected by our decision 
however  due to the general uncertainties surrounding our business resulting from am best s march downgrade of our financial strength ratings and our decision to explore strategic alternatives  we concluded that there are no absolute assurances that we will have the abilit y to hold the affected investments for a sufficient period of time 
it is possibl e that the investment securities fair values could change in subsequent periods  resulting in further material impairment charges 
while we have had sufficient liquidity to pay the losses we experienced in the past hurricane season  in the future  we may need to raise capital through debt or equity or other securities to further expand our business strategy or enter new lines of business 
the amount and timing of any capital raise will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
at this time  we are not able to quantify the amoun t of additional capital we may raise or will require in the future or predict the timing of any other future capital needs 
any future equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we raise capital through equity financings  your interest in our company will be diluted and the securities we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges that ar e senior to those of the shares that are currently issued and outstanding 
if we cannot maintain or obtain adequate capital to manage our business strategy  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
dividends and redemptions as a holding company  we depend on future dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to pay dividends to our common and preferred shareholders 
our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  as well as our ability to pay dividends  is subject to regulatory  contractual  rating agency and other constraints 
furthermore  the terms of our letter of credit and revolving credit facility prohibit us from repurchasing shares and paying dividends on our shares without the consent of our lenders 
we have obtained a consent under our current letter of credit and revolving credit facility for the payment of dividends on our series a preferre d shares 
however  the facility prohibits us from paying dividends on our series a preferred shares so long as there is a default under that agreement 
future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may also contain provisions prohibiting or limiting the payment of dividends on our shares under certain circumstances 
if we experience a change of control  we ma y be required to make offers to redeem our series a preferred shares at a price o f per share  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption and on the terms described in the certificate of designation 
our series a preferred shares have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into any of our other securities or property 
we are also subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares  redeem our series a preferred shares an d make other payments 
under the companies act  even though we are solvent and able to pay our liabilities as they become due  we may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution if we have reasonable grounds for believing tha t we are  or will after the payment be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets will thereby be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts 
under the companies act  when a company issues shares  the aggregate paid in par value of the issued shares comprises the company s share capital account 
when shares are issued at a premium  that is  where the actual sum paid for a share exceeds the par value of the share  the amount paid in excess of the par value must be allocated to and maintained in a capital account calle d the share premium account 
currently  quanta holdings has approximately million in its share premium account 
quanta holdings has a high share premium account due to the significant difference between the par value of our common shares and series a preferred shares and the amounts paid for those shares in recent and historical offerings of the company 
the companies act requires shareholder approval prior to any reduction of our share capital or share premium accounts 
bermuda law also provides that we maintain a contribute d surplus account  to which we must allocate  among other things  shareholder capital which is unrelated to any share subscription 
we believe that we currently have sufficient assets to pay our foreseen liabilities as they become due 
as a result of our losses  for bermuda company law purposes  we expect that the realizable value of our assets will no longer exceed the aggregate of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts 
so long as this deficiency continues  we are prohibited by bermuda company law from paying dividends or making distributions to our shareholders  including our holders of series a preferred shares 
in order for quanta holdings to have the flexibility to pay dividends to shareholders  we ar e evaluating a proposal to reduce the share premium account and allocate sums to our contributed surplus account 
this reduction of our share premium account an d reallocation to the contributed surplus account would require the approval of our common shareholders to be effective 
if our common shareholders do not approve any such proposal  we may be restricted by bermuda company law from declaring or paying dividends to our holders of series a preferred shares and other shareholders 
we cannot make any assurances that we will have the ability to declare and pay dividends under bermuda law to our shareholders in the future 
in addition  even if we submit  and our shareholders approve  any proposal and we are permitted by law to declare and pay dividends  we cannot assure you that future losses or other events could not impair our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
while our financial advisors will also help us evaluate the potential use of excess capital to return value to our shareholders  in addition to the restrictions described above relating to our operating subsidiaries  we may be limited in the amount of any dividends that could be paid on  or the amount of any redemption of  our shares 
under bermuda law  we may not declare or pay a dividend or redeem our shares including our series a preferred shares at any time if we have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or after the payment or redemption would be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due 
we also may not declare or pa y a dividend or redeem our shares including our series a preferred shares excep t out of the capital paid up thereon  out of our issued share capital and share premium accounts or  in the case of a redemption  out of the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose of the redemption

we have not estimated dividends payable on our series a preferred shares as they are perpetual and have no fixed mandatory redemption date unless a change of control occurs or we are able to redeem the preferred shares 
we do not have the right to redeem our series a preferred shares until on or after december  assuming  shares of our series a preferred shares are outstanding during any applicable period  we would be required to pay dividends  on an annual basis  of an aggregate of approximately million 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses consists of case reserves an d ibnr 
in assessing the adequacy of these reserves  it must be noted that the actual costs of settling claims is uncertain as it depends upon future events 
many of these events will be out of our control and could potentially affect th e ultimate liability and timing of any potential payment 
there is necessarily a range of possible outcomes and the eventual outcome will certainly differ from the projections currently made 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited company specific claims loss emergence patterns 
consequently  we must use industry benchmarks  on a line by line basis  in deriving ibnr which  despite management s and our independent actuary s care in selecting them  will differ from actual experience 
similarly  we have limited loss payout pattern information specific t o our experience  therefore we have used industry data  on a line by line basis  to estimate our expected payments 
consequently  despite management s care in selecting them  the actual payment of our reserve for losses and loss expenses will differ from estimated payouts 
off balance sheet arrangements other than as described under liquidity related to our trust preferred securities offerings through the quanta trust i and quanta trust ii together quanta trust i and ii  as of december   we have not entere d into any off balance sheet arrangements with special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
we did not consolidate quanta trust i and ii  the issuer of the trust preferred securities and a variable interest entity  since we are not the primary beneficiary of quanta trust i or ii 
as of december   we have recorded the million of debentures  which were issued to quanta trust i and ii  on our consolidated balance sheet

factors that affect capital requirements generally include premium volume  the extent and nature of loss and loss expense reserves  the type and form of insurance and reinsurance business underwritten and the availability of reinsurance protection from adequately rated retrocessionaires on terms that are acceptable to us 
in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate insurers and reinsurers are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital and risk based capital  the calculation of which includes numerous factors as specified by the respective insurance regulatory authorities and the related insurance regulations 
we capitalize our insurance operations in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements in order to enable us to write more business an d to be more selective in the business we underwrite 
accordingly  allocation of capital sufficient to achieve business objectives is a critical aspect of any insurance organization  particularly an insurance operation with a limited operating history such as ours

substantially all of our capital has been distributed among our rated operating subsidiaries based on our assessment of the levels of capital that we believe are prudent to support our expected levels of business  the applicable regulatory requirements  and the recommendations of the insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
posting of security by our non us operating subsidiaries our bermuda  united kingdom  and irish operating subsidiaries are not licensed  accredited or otherwise approved as reinsurers anywhere in the united states 
many us jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credi t on their us statutory financial statements for reinsurance to cover unpaid liabilities  such as loss and loss adjustment expense and unearned premium reserves  obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers without appropriate security acceptable to us insurance commissioners 
typically  this type of security will take the form of a letter of credit issued by an acceptable bank  the establishment of a trust  funds withheld or a combination of these elements as described under liquidity above we entered into a secured bank credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that allows us to provide to our insured clients up to million in letters of credit as security under the terms of insurance and reinsurance contracts 
the availability to a borrower is based on the amount of eligible investments pledged by that borrower and no material adverse change provisions 
regulatory restrictions will also limit the amount of investments that may be pledged by our us insurance borrowers and  consequently  the amount available for letters of credit and borrowings under the facility to those borrowers 
we currently have approximately million of secured letters of credit issued and outstanding under the facility 
as of december   we have approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
some of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contain termination rights that are triggered by the am best rating downgrade 
some o f these insurance and reinsurance contracts also require us to post additional security 
as a result  we may be required to post additional security either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
we may also elect to post security under other insurance contracts in order to maintain tha t business 
we currently have net cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million that are available to post as security or place in trust 
we cannot draw letters of credit or borrow under our existing credit agreement if we have incurred a material adverse effect or if a default exists under the agreement 
if we fail to maintain or enter into adequate letter of credit facilities on a timely basis  we may be unable to provide necessary security to cedent companies under our existing retrocessional and reinsurance contracts that have the right to require the posting of additional security by reason of the downgrade of our am best rating 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase the commitment under our existing bank credit facility or obtain additional credit facilities at terms acceptable to us 
our inability to maintain or enter into adequate credit facilities would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that ar e inherently subjective in nature and require management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies used to determine inherently subjective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the use of different assumptions and estimates could produce materially different estimates of the reported amounts 
in addition  if actual events differ materially from management s assumptions used in applying the relevant accounting policy  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used now or to be used in the future in the preparation o f our consolidated financial statements 
premiums written  ceded and earned the method by which we record and recognize premiums written differs based upon the nature of the underlying insurance or reinsurance contract 
insurance premiums written are generally defined in the associated policies  are recorded on the inception date of the policies and are earned ove r the terms of the policies in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
typically this results in the earning of premium on a pro rata as to time basis over the term of the related insurance coverage 
reinsurance premiums written are recorded based on the type of the associated reinsurance contract 
typically  we write losses occurring and risks attaching contracts on a single year basis 
we may on occasion write multi year reinsurance contracts 
losses occurring reinsurance contracts cover losses that occur during the term of the reinsurance contract 
risks attaching contracts cover claims that arise on underlying insurance policies that incept during the term of the reinsurance contract 
reinsurance premiums written are earned on a pro rata over time basis over the expected term of the contract  typically months for losses occurring contracts 
premiums written on risks attaching reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying policies or risks are expected to incept 
premiums earned on risks attaching contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract resulting in recognition of premium earnings over an extended period  typically months 
reinsurance premiums on multi year losses occurring reinsurance contracts that are payable in annual installments are recorded as premiums written on an annual basis at inception and on the contract anniversary dates i f the reinsured has the ability to cancel  commute or change the coverage during the contract term or if the contract provides for varying amounts of reinsuranc e coverage for each annual period for which there is a specified premium installment 
reinsurance premiums written on certain types of contracts  notably treaty quota share contracts  may not be known definitively on the inception date of the contract and therefore include estimates of premiums written 
these estimates are based on data provided by the ceding companies or brokers  our underwriters judgment and underlying economic conditions 
our estimates of written premiums are re evaluated over the term of the contract period as underwriting information becomes available and as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies or brokers 
for certain excess of loss reinsurance contracts we record the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  as our estimated premium written at inception of the contract 
subsequent changes to our premium estimates are recorded as adjustments to premiums written in the period in which they become known and could be material 
adjustments may significantly impact net income in the period in which they are determined  particularly when the subject contract is fully or substantially expired resulting in the premium adjustment being fully or substantially earned 
some of our contracts include retrospective rating provisions that adjust estimated premiums or acquisition expenses based upon experience and underwriting results 
we also write certain structured insurance and reinsuranc e contracts as risk management solutions that cannot otherwise be provided by traditional contracts 
typically  we assume a measured amount of risk in exchange for a premium  a specified portion of which may be returnable to the insured based on the level of loss experience or underwriting profitability 
adjustments related to retrospective rating provisions that adjust estimated premiums or acquisition expenses are recognized over contract periods in accordance with the underlying contract terms based on current experience under the contracts 
reinstatement premiums that reinstate coverage limits under pre defined contract terms and are triggered by the occurrence of a loss are written and earned at the time the associated loss event occurs 
the original contract premium is earned over the remaining exposure period of the contract 
profit commissions are expenses that vary with and are directly related to acquiring new and renewal insurance and reinsurance business 
profit commission accruals are recorded in acquisition costs and are adjusted at the end of each reporting period based on the experience of the underlying contract 
no claims bonuses are accrued as a reduction of earned premium and are adjusted at the en d of each reporting period based on the experience of the underlying contract 
retrospective rating adjustments are necessarily based on underwriting results that include certain estimates relating to premiums and losses  and are therefore subject to adjustment as underwriting experience develops and actual underwriting results become known 
in the normal course of business  we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional coverage in order to increase our underwriting capacity and to limit our individual and aggregate exposures to risks of losses arising from th e contracts of insurance or reinsurance that we underwrite 
reinsurance premiums ceded to reinsurers are recorded and recognized in a manner consistent with the terms of reinsurance agreement and the related premiums written under the original reinsured contracts or policies 
premiums written and ceded relating to the unexpired periods of coverage or policy terms are recorded as unearned premium reserves and deferred reinsurance premiums  respectively 
in the normal course of our operations  we may enter into certain contracts that do not meet the risk transfer provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts sfas for financial reporting purposes either due to insufficient underwriting risk or insufficient timing risk or provide indemnification for insurance accounting under sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 
for these contracts we follow the deposit method of accounting as prescribed in american institute of certified public accountants  known as the aicpa  statement of position  deposit accounting accounting for insuranc e and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk sop 
th e deposit method of accounting requires that the premium we receive or pay  less any explicitly defined margins or fees retained or paid  is accounted for as deposit asset or deposit liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
explicitl y defined fees retained or paid are deferred and recognized in other income in ou r consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income according to the nature of the product or service provided 
for those contracts that transfer significant underwriting risk only and for reinsurance contracts where it is not reasonably possible that we can realize a significant loss even though we assume significant insurance risk  th e deposit asset or liability is measured based on the unexpired portion of the coverage provided 
the deposit asset or liability is adjusted for any losses incurred or recoverable based on the present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the loss event with the adjustment being recorded in net losses and loss expenses within our results of operations 
for those contracts that transfer neither significant underwriting risk nor significant timing risk and for contracts that transfer significant timing risk only  the deposit asset or liability is adjusted  and corresponding interest income or expense recognized within our results of operations  by usin g the interest method to calculate the effective yield on the deposit based on th e estimated amount and timing of cash flows 
if a change in the actual or estimated timing or amount of cash flows occurs  the effective yield is recalculated and the deposit is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of the insurance o r reinsurance contract 
the adjustment is recorded as interest income or interest expense 
non traditional contracts we write non traditional contracts of insurance and reinsurance 
we may account for these transactions as deposits held on behalf of our clients instead of as insurance and reinsurance premiums  as appropriate 
under the deposit method of accounting  revenues and expenses from insurance and reinsurance contracts are not recognized as written premium and incurred losses instead  amounts from these contracts are recognized as other income or investment income over the expected contract or service period 
pursuant to our revenue recognition policy  a contract is non traditional if it contains certain terms and features or otherwise results in a structure that we believe limits our insurance risks  including timing risks  or that does not provide for a reasonable possibility of significant loss 
these terms or features include  among others  experience based adjustabl e features  consideration of investment income  an amount of funding or financing of a portion of potential expected losses and coverage for the adverse development of previously incurred losses 
non traditional contracts are also those contracts that are not necessarily intended to provide for the transfer o f economic risk but for which coverage is triggered by a non insurance event or for which coverage is provided to achieve temporary accounting or regulatory relief or other non economic or risk management benefits 
for example  one of our non traditional contracts is a life surplus relief transaction that provide s temporary statutory capital benefit to a us life insurance entity 
we use the test set forth in sfas to ascertain whether we believe our underwriting ris k is limited or whether there is not a reasonable possibility of significant loss these tests include a number of subjective judgments 
because of this subjectivity and in the context of evolving practices and application of existing and future standards  we could be required in the future to adjust our accounting treatment of these transactions 
this could have a material effect o n our financial condition and results of operations 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized in other income million and million of fees and revenues relating to non traditional contracts which we accounted for using the deposit method 
if these contracts transferred risk as determined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  gross premium relating to these contracts would total approximately million and million in the years ended december  and of the million and million  million and million o f other income recognized during the years ended december  and relat e to fees earned from a surplus relief life reinsurance arrangement with a us insurance company which meets the company s definition of a non traditional contract 
as of december  and  the company has provided approximately million and million of statutory surplus relief to th e us insurance company under this contract 
in the fourth quarter of  unde r this contract the company entered into an arrangement with a client and assumed through novation agreements  several life reinsurance contracts it had made 
because the company assumed these contracts  the client  which is subject to insurance regulation in the united states and therefore is required to maintain a certain amount of statutory capital  may reduce its statutory capital requirements 
in exchange for the company s assumption of the contracts it received a fee 
the arrangement  among other things  also provides that on certain dates and during specific periods  the client has the right but not the obligation to recapture the life reinsurance contracts the company has assumed  provided that the underlying cedants do not reasonably withhold their consent t o this recapture 
the company believes that its client is economically incentivized to exercise the recapture provision in the future  as the amount o f expected profit on the underlying life reinsurance contracts emerges over time 
we believe the arrangement  including the client s option to recapture  and the assumption of the life insurance contracts constitute one contract with minimal mortality  credit or other insurance or economic risk which results in deposit accounting 
although the company believes its client will exercise the recapture  it is not assured that this will be the case 
if the company s client does not recapture the underlying insurance contracts in the future  the company may be viewed as having had the risks described above and  as a result  the company could be deemed to have retained life reinsurance risk and  as a result  may be required to account for some or all of the underlying insurance contracts as life insurance  recognizing life premiums written and life benefit reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
if deposit accounting had not been used with respect to this particular arrangement  the company would have recognized gross life reinsurance premiums written of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and at this time  the company believes that the recognition of these premiums written would not have had a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
however  as the underlying life insurance contracts mature the effect on the company s financia l condition and results of operations may become material 
in respect of the life reinsurance arrangements written on a coinsurance basis  where investment assets have been transferred to the company such assets have been recorded within the company s trading investment portfoli o and are separately presented as investments related to deposit liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
a deposit liability has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments for non risk investment contract s as an interest bearing instrument using the effective yield method 
the investments related to deposit liability are held in trust funds and are pledge d to the ceding companies 
in respect of the life reinsurance arrangements written on a modified coinsurance basis  the ceding company s net statutory reserves and assets are withheld and remain legally owned by the ceding company 
these modified coinsurance contracts represent non cash financial reinsurance transactions  whereby  in accordance with the contract terms  there are no net cash flows at inception of contracts  nor are there expected to be net cash flows through the life of the contracts  other than the company s explicitly defined fees 
notional contract assets and liabilities contemplated by the contract terms are offset i n accordance with fin and as such the company does not present such assets or deposit liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
certain of the company s coinsurance and modified coinsurance agreements may contain provisions that qualify as embedded derivatives under derivatives implementation group issue no 
b embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments dig issue b the value of embedded derivatives in these contracts is currently considered immaterial 
the company monitors the performance of these treaties on a quarterly basis 
significant adverse performance or changes in the company s expectations of future cashflow s on these treaties could result in losses associated with the embedded derivative 
of the million and million  million and million o f other income recognized during the years ended december  and relat e to explicitly defined margins on one short duration contract written by the company s specialty reinsurance segment that does not meet the risk transfer provisions of sfas this contract was written on a funds withheld basis  such that the deposit liability of million and million recorded is equal to a funds withheld asset according to the contract terms 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts  the funds withheld asset and the deposit liability have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million and million of other income derived from non traditional contracts recognized during the years ended december  and relates to revenues earned from five and one reinsurance contract s accounted for as deposits 
although these contracts did possess some underwriting and timing risks as prescribed by sfas no 
 the company does not believe it is exposed to a reasonable possibility of significant loss 
included in the remaining million and million of other income are million and million related to one surplus relief life reinsurance agreement 
underlying treaties attach to this contract on a coinsurance basis 
as of december  and  the company has provided approximately million and million of statutory surplus relief to a us insurance company under this contract 
acquisition expenses and ceding commission income acquisition costs are policy issuance related costs that vary with an d are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and reinsurance business  and primarily consist of commissions  third party brokerage and insurance premium taxes 
ceding commission income consists of commissions we receive on insurance and reinsurance business that we cede to ou r reinsurers 
typically acquisition costs and commission income are based on a fixed percentage of the premium written or ceded 
this percentage varies for each line or class of business and each type of contract written 
acquisition expenses and commission income are recorded and deferred at the time premium is written or ceded and are subsequently amortized in earnings as the premiums to which they relate are earned or expensed 
acquisition expenses are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations net of ceding commission income from our reinsurers 
acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums are deferred in the balance sheet as deferred acquisition costs net of commission income relating to deferred reinsurance premiums ceded 
net deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value and are limited to the amount expected to be recovered from future net earned premiums and anticipated investment income 
any limitation is referred to as a premium deficiency 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of our anticipated losses  loss expenses and unamortized acquisition costs exceeds the recorded unearned premium reserve and anticipated net investment income 
a premium deficiency is recognized by charging any deferred acquisition costs to acquisition expenses to the extent required to eliminate the deficiency 
if the deficiency exceeds the deferred acquisition cost asset then a liability is accrued within loss and loss expense reserves for the exces s deficiency 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance assets due from our reinsurers under the terms of ceded reinsurance contracts include unpaid loss recoveries  loss and loss expense reserves recoverable and deferred reinsurance premiums 
we are subject to credi t risk with respect to our reinsurance ceded because the ceding of risk does not relieve us from our obligations to our insureds 
to the extent our reinsurers default  we must settle these obligations without the benefit of reinsurance protection 
failure of our reinsurers to honor their obligations could result i n credit losses 
if the financial condition of any of our reinsurers deteriorates resulting in their inability to make payments to us  we establish allowances fo r amounts considered potentially uncollectible from such reinsurers 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions  activities  or economic characteristics of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
as of december   our reinsurance recoverables recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were million  of which approximately and were due from two reinsurers rated a and a by am best 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized from future anticipated taxable income 
as of december   our net deferred tax assets were million against which we provided a valuation allowance on the basis that  given our limited operating history  the realization of deferred tax assets fro m our anticipated future taxable income is neither assured nor accurately determinable 
if we subsequently assess that the valuation allowance  or any portion thereof  is no longer required an income tax benefit will be recorded i n net income in the period in which such assessment is made 
investments our publicly traded and non publicly traded fixed maturity  short ter m investments and equity securities that are classified as available for sale are recorded at estimated fair value with the difference between cost or amortized cost and fair value  net of the effect of taxes  included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet 
our publicly traded and non publicly traded fixed maturity and short term investments that are classified as trading are recorded at estimated fair value with the change in fair value included in net realized gains on investments in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income 
short term investments include highly liquid debt instruments and commercial paper that are generally due within one year of the date of purchase and are held as part of our investment portfolios that are managed by independent investment managers 
the fair value of publicly traded securities i s based upon quoted market prices 
the estimated fair value of non publicly trade d securities is based on independent third party pricing sources 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we periodically review our investments to determine whether an impairment  being a decline in fair value of a security below its amortized cost  is other than temporary 
if such a decline is classified as other than temporary  we would write down  to fair value  the impaired security resulting in a new cost basis of the security and the amount of the write down would be charged to the statement of operations and comprehensive loss income as a realized loss 
the new cost basis would not be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
some of the factors that we consider in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary include the amount of the impairment  the period o f time for which the fair value has been below the amortized cost  specific reasons or market conditions which could affect the security  including the financial condition of the issuer and relevant industry conditions or rating agency actions  and our ability and intent to hold the security for sufficient time to allow for possible recovery 
investments are recorded on a trade date basis 
our net investment income is recognized when earned and consists primarily of interest  the accrua l of discount or amortization of premium on fixed maturity securities and dividends  and is net of investment management and custody expenses 
gains and losses realized on the sale of investments are determined on the first in  first out basis 
as of december   approximately and of the amortized cost of our available for sale investment portfolio was assigned an aaa credit rating and an a credit rating or above by s p 
capitalization of software costs we capitalize software costs when the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to fund the software project which it deems probable will be completed and used to perform the intended function 
this policy is in accordance with aicpa statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
software costs that are capitalized include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing  or obtained for internal use computer software 
we cease the capitalization of costs as soon as the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
we review the carrying value of capitalized software costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable  and a loss is recognized when the value of estimated undiscounted cash flow benefit related to the asset falls below the unamortized cost 
reserve for losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company we are required  under gaap and applicable insurance regulations  to establish reserves for losses and loss expenses for estimates of future amounts to be paid in settlement of our ultimate liabilities for claims arising under the terms of written insurance an d reinsurance policies that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
under gaap  we are only permitted to establish loss and loss expense reserves for actual losses that have occurred before the balance sheet date 
we do not record contingency reserves for expected future loss occurrences  nor do we discount our reserves for losses and loss expenses to be paid in the future 
the estimation of future ultimate loss liabilities is the most significant judgment made by management and is inherently subject to significan t uncertainties 
these uncertainties are driven by many variables that are difficult to quantify and include  for example  the period of time between the occurrence of an insured loss and actual settlement  fluctuations in inflation  prevailing economic  social and judicial trends  legislative changes  internal and third party claims handling procedures  and the lack of complete historical data on which to base loss expectations 
it may also be difficult for us to accurately estimate ultimate losses based on our own historical claim experiences because of our limited operating history 
the estimation of unpaid loss liabilities will be affected by the typ e or structure of the policies we have written 
in the case of our direct insurance business we often assume risks for which claims experience will tend to be frequency driven 
as a result  historical loss development data may be available and traditional actuarial methods of loss estimation may be used 
conversely  the available amount of relevant loss experience that we can use to quantify the emergence  severity and payout characteristics of the loss liabilities is limited for policies that are written with the expectation that potential losses will be characterized by lower frequency but higher severity claims  such as many of ou r reinsurance contracts written 
the estimation of unpaid loss liabilities will also vary in subjectivity depending on the lines or class of business involved 
short tail business describes lines of business for which losses become known and paid in a relatively short period time after the loss actually occurs 
typically  there will be less variability in the ultimate amount of losses from claims incurred in the short tail lines that we write such as technical risk property  property marine  and aviation 
long tail business describes lines of business for which actual losses may not be known for some time or for which the actual amount of loss may take a significantly longer period of time to emerge or develop 
our casualty  professional and environmental lines of business are generally considered longer tail in nature 
because loss emergence and settlement periods can be many years in duration  these lines of business will have more variability in the estimates of their loss and loss expense reserves 
our loss and loss expense reserves fall into two categories reserves for unpaid reported losses and for losses incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims 
reported claim reserves are based initially on claim reports received from insureds  brokers or ceding companies  and may be supplemented by our claims professionals with estimates of additional ultimate settlement costs 
ibnr reserves are calculated using generally accepted statistical and actuarial techniques 
in applying these techniques  we rely on the most recent informatio n available  including pricing information  industry data and on our historical loss and loss expense experience 
where our historical loss information is limited  we increase our reliance on individual pricing analyses and industry loss information to guide our estimates 
we may also utilize commercially available computer models to evaluate future trends and to estimate ultimate claim costs 
from time to time we engage independent external actuarial specialists to review our estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and our reserving methods 
even though our reserving techniques are actuarially sound  there may still be significant subsequent adjustments to loss and loss expense reserves due to the nature of our business and the risks written 
as of december  and  the primary reserving method we use d to estimate the ultimate cost of losses for our specialty reinsurance lines and our fidelity and technical risk property specialty insurance business lines was the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method 
the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method selects an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio supplemented wit h our actual loss and loss expense experience to date to support the estimation o f losses and loss adjustment expenses 
our initial expected loss and loss expense ratio for our specialty reinsurance business lines is derived from loss exposur e information provided by brokers and ceding companies and from loss and loss expense ratios established during the pricing of individual contracts 
our initial expected losses and loss expense ratios selected for our fidelity and technical risk property specialty insurance lines are based on benchmarks derived by our underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business and from comparable market information 
these benchmarks are then adjusted for any rating increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
the primary reserving method we used to estimate the ultimate cost of losses for our other specialty insurance business lines was an expected loss ratio methodology whereby earned premiums are multiplied by an expected loss ratio to derive ultimate losses and deducts any paid losses and loss expenses t o arrive at estimated losses and loss expense reserves 
this method is commonly applied when there is insufficient historical loss development experience available 
our initial expected losses and loss expense ratios selected are based on benchmarks derived by our underwriters and actuaries during the initia l pricing of the business and from comparable market information 
these benchmark s are then adjusted for any rating increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
as of december   given our limited operating history and historical claims experience  the primary reserving method adopted was an expected loss ratio methodology whereby earned premiums are multiplied by an expected loss ratio to derive ultimate losses and deducts any paid losses and loss expenses to arrive at estimated loss and loss expense reserves 
this method is commonly applied when there is insufficient historical loss development experience available 
the initial expected loss ratios were derived from pricing  loss and exposure information provided by brokers  ceding companies and insureds and supplemented by available industry data 
we believe that these assumptions represent a realistic and appropriate basis for currently estimating our loss and loss expense reserves 
however  given our limited operating history  we believe that our estimates of loss and loss expense reserves may be subject to significant volatility and as our own loss experience begins to develop  we may expand our reserving analyses to include other commonly used methods 
these reserving methods may lead to reserve estimates that are more volatile than those based upon a long  consistent history of our own reported loss experience 
we continually review our reserve estimate and reserving methodologie s taking into account all currently known information and updated assumptions related to unknown information 
loss and loss expense reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claim experience develops and new information becomes available 
any adjustments to previously established reserves  resultin g from a change in estimate  may significantly impact current period underwriting results and net income by reducing net income if previous period reserve estimates prove to be deficient or improve net income if prior period reserves become redundant 
losses and loss expense arising from future insured events will be estimated and provided for at the time the losses are incurred and coul d be substantial 
as of december   a change in our reserves for loss and loss expenses of million would equate to a million change in our reserves for loss and loss expenses  which would represent of our net los s for the year ended december  and of our shareholders equity as of december  environmental remediation liabilities assumed in our technical services segment we assume environmental liabilities in exchange for remediation fees and contracts to perform the required remediation in accordance with the underlying remediation agreements 
we estimate our initial and ongoing ultimate liabilities for such environmental remediation obligations using actual experience  past experience with similar remediation projects  technical engineering examinations of the contaminated sites and state  local and federal guidelines 
however  we cannot assure you that actual remediation costs will not significantly differ from our estimated amounts 
we continually review our estimates for ultimate remediation costs taking into account all currently known information and updated assumptions related to unknown information 
any adjustments to previously established liabilities  resulting from a change in our estimates  may significantly impact our current period operating results 
as of december   we had assumed two environmental remediation projects for which we have recorded an estimated liability of million 
when we receive consideration for the assumption of a remediation liability that is in excess of our estimate of the related environmental remediation liability  we initially defer the excess amount and record it in deferred income on the consolidated balance sheet 
this deferred remediation revenue is recognized in earnings over the anticipated remediation period using the cost recovery or percentage of completion method that is based on the ratio of remediation expenses actually incurred and paid to total anticipated remediation costs 
as of december   we had deferred approximately million of remediation revenue that was included in deferred income 
technical services revenues technical services revenue is primarily derived from short term technical services arrangements with customers 
generally  technical services revenue is earned in the period for which services are performed 
included in technical services revenue is accrued but unbilled revenue that arises mainly due to a time lag in billing cycle and special billing arrangements with customers 
from time to time  we retain subcontractors to perform certain services under contracts with our technical services customers 
technical services revenue is recognized on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor in the arrangement and we bear the ultimate risks of providing such subcontracted services 
in assessing whether gross revenue reporting is appropriate  we consider a number of factors such as whether we act as principa l in the transaction  retain the general risks of loss for collection  delivery  or returns  or whether we have control over contract pricing and vendor selection 
for the years ended december  and and the period from september  to december   we incurred approximately million million and million of direct costs  exclusive of mark up  respectively  related to subcontractor arrangements 
our technical services revenue would be significantly reduced if these arrangements were recorded on a net of direct cost basis 
other accounts receivable the majority of our other accounts receivable balances comprise amounts due under technical services arrangements with customers 
we establish bad debt allowances  or valuation reserves  based on specific identification of likely losses of accounts with individual customers 
we periodically re evaluat e these valuation reserve estimates  if any  and adjust them as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause these valuation reserves to be revised include changes in our clients financial standing such as liquidity and credit quality and other factors that negatively impact our clients ability to pay their obligations as they become due 
stock based compensation we currently account for stock compensation in accordance with apb compensation expense for stock options and stock based awards granted to employees is recognized using the intrinsic value method to the extent that the fair value of the stock exceeds the exercise price of option or similar award a t the measurement date 
the compensation expense  if any  is recorded in our results of operations over the shorter of the vesting period of the award or employee service period 
generally  we will issue stock options and stock based awards to employees with a strike price equal to the estimated fair value of th e stock on the grant date of the award such that no compensation expense recognition is required  in accordance with apb in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to sfas  however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values and  accordingly  sfas r does not allow pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition sfas r is effective for the beginning of the first annual period beginning after september  in march  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab providing guidance on sfas r 
sab was issued to assist issuers in their initial implementation of sfas r and enhance the information received by investors and other users of the financial statements 
the company plans to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r during the year ended december  will be approximately million  however  this may vary depending on levels of share based payments granted during however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note s to our consolidated financial statements 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we engage in certain derivative related activities and have adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and sfas  amendment of statement no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we primarily enter into investment related derivative transactions  a s permitted by our investment guidelines  and typically for the purposes of managing investment duration  interest rate and foreign currency exposure  and enhancing total investment returns 
we may also  as part of our business  enter into derivative transactions for the purpose of replicating approved investment insurance or reinsurance transactions that meet our investment or our underwriting guidelines 
as of december   we held in our available for sale fixed maturity portfolio a mortality risk linked security fo r which the repayment of principal was dependent on the performance of a specifie d mortality index 
the component of the bond that was linked to the mortality index had been determined  under sfas  to be an embedded derivative that wa s not clearly and closely related to its host contract a debt security and was therefore bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative under sfas this security was sold during the year ended december  we have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
we recognize all standalone derivative instruments as either other assets or liabilities and embedded derivatives as part of their host instrument s in our consolidated balance sheet and we measure all derivative instruments at their fair value 
the fair values of derivative instruments are based on market prices and equivalent data provided by independent third parties 
when market data is not readily available  we use analytical models to estimate the fair values of these instruments based on their structure  terms and conditions and prevailing market conditions 
we recognize changes in the fair value of derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations in other income 
the nature of derivative instruments and estimates used in estimating their fair value  changes in fair value of derivatives and realized gains and losses on settled derivative instruments may create significant volatility in our results of operations in future periods 
annual incentive plan we adopted an annual variable cash compensation plan annual incentive plan which is generally available to our employees 
awards paid under this plan are dependent on performance measured at an individual and line of business level 
in general  our annual incentive plan provides for an annual bonus award to employees that is based on a sharing of profit in excess of a minimum return on capital to our shareholders for each calendar year 
profit fo r each calendar year is measured by estimating the ultimate net present value of after tax profit generated from business during that calendar year and is re estimated on an annual basis through the vesting period 
annual incentive plan awards vest and are paid out over four annual installments 
however  with respect to  as part of the company s retention plan  awards vest in two annual installments  the first of which was of the award and was paid in and the second of which will be of the award and will be paid in unvested amounts are subject to be adjustments to the extent that estimates of calendar year profit and estimated net present value deviate from initial estimates as assumptions are updated and actual information becomes known 
we recognize expenses related to annual incentive plan awards by applying the graded vesting method as prescribed by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin 
we continually review and adjust our provisions for annual incentive plan awards and other bonus awards taking into account known information and updated assumptions related to unknown information 
award provisions are necessarily an estimate an d amounts established in prior periods are adjusted in our current results of operations as new information becomes available to us 
any adjustments we make to previously established provisions or the establishment of new provisions may significantly impact our current period results and net income 
recent accounting pronouncements see note x to the consolidated financial statements which are included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk can be described as the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  creditworthiness  foreig n exchange rates or other factors 
we are exposed to potential loss from these factors 
our most significant financial instruments are our investment assets which consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and cash equivalents that are denominated in both us and foreign currencies 
external investment professionals manage our investment portfolios in accordance with our investmen t guidelines 
our investment guidelines also permit our investment managers to us e derivative instruments in very limited circumstances 
we will seek to mitigate market risks by a number of actions  as described below 
derivative valuation risk our derivative policy permits the use of derivatives to manage our portfolio s duration  yield curve  currency exposure  credit exposure  exposure to volatility and to take advantage of inefficiencies in derivatives markets 
w e may also enter into derivative transactions to hedge capital market risks that may be present in our contracts of insurance or reinsurance and as replication transactions which we define as a set of derivative  insurance and or securities transactions that  when combined  produce the equivalent economic result of an investment security or insurance or reinsurance contract that meets our investment or underwriting guidelines 
we utilize derivative instruments only when we believe the terms and structure of the contracts are thoroughly understood and its total return profile and risk characteristics can be fully analyzed 
also  any single derivative or group of derivatives in the aggregate cannot create risk characteristics that are inconsistent with our overall risk profile and investment portfolio guidelines 
foreign currency risk and functional currency our reporting currency is the us dollar 
although we have not experienced any significant net exposures to foreign currency risk  we expect that in the future our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates will be concentrated in our investment assets  investments in foreign subsidiaries  premiums receivable and insurance reserves arising from known or probable losses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we generally manage our foreign currency risk by maintaining assets denominated in the same currenc y as our insurance liabilities resulting in a natural hedge or by entering into foreign currency forward derivative contracts in an effort to hedge against movements in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
these contracts are not designated as specific hedges for financial reporting purpose s and therefore realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in income in the period in which they occur 
these contracts generally have maturities of three months or less 
a foreign currency forward contract results in an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date and price specified at the time of the contract 
foreign currency forward contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
we have not and do not expect to enter into such contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets or liabilities 
our non us subsidiaries maintain both assets and liabilities in their functional currencies  principally euro and sterling 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in currenc y exchange rates 
exchange rate fluctuations in euro and sterling functional currencies against our us dollar reporting currency are reported as a separat e component of other comprehensive loss income in shareholders equity 
foreign exchange risk associated with non us dollar functional currencies of our foreig n subsidiaries is reviewed as part of our risk management process and we employ foreign currency risk management strategies  as described above  to manage our exposure 
exchange rate fluctuations against non us dollar functional currencies may materially impact our consolidated statement of operations and financial position 
our investment guidelines limit the amount of our investment portfoli o that may be denominated in foreign currencies to as measured by market value 
furthermore  our guidelines limit the amount of foreign currency denominated investments that can be held without a corresponding hedge against the foreign currency exposure to as measured by market value 
as of december   our investment portfolio included million  or  of our total net invested assets  of securities that were denominated in foreign currencies and were purchased by our investment managers for the purpose of improving overall portfolio yield 
these securities were rated aaa and were substantially hedged into us dollars according to our investment guidelines b y entering into foreign currency forward contracts 
at december   the net fair market value of foreign currency forward contracts relating to foreign currency denominated investments was negligible 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is concentrated in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of fixed income securities 
accordingly  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of fixed income securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk includes maintaining a high quality investment portfolio that is actively managed by our managers in accordance with our investment guidelines in order to balance our exposure to interest rates with the requirement to tailor the duration  yield  currency and liquidity characteristics to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of claim reserve liabilities 
as of december   assuming parallel shifts in interest rates  the impact of an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates on our net invested assets  including cash and cash equivalents  under management by third party investment managers of approximately million would have been an estimated decrease in market value of approximately million  or  and the impact on our net invested assets  including cash and cash equivalents  under management by third party investment managers of an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have been an estimated increase in market value of approximately million  or as of december   our investment portfolio included aaa rated mortgage backed securities with a market value of million  or  excluding trading investments related to deposit liabilities 
as with other fixed income investments  the fair market value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates can also expose us to prepayment and extension risks on these investments 
in periods of declining interest rates  the frequency of mortgage prepayments generally increase as mortgagees seek to refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
mortgage prepayments result in the early repayment of the underlying principal of mortgage backed securities requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates 
when interest rates increase  these assets are exposed to extension risk  which occurs when holders of underlying mortgages reduce the frequency on which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and delay any refinancing of the outstanding principal 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
this risk is defined as the default or the potential loss in market value resulting from adverse changes in the borrower s ability to repay the debt 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and to any one issuer 
w e attempt to limit our overall credit exposure by purchasing fixed income securities that are generally rated investment grade by moody s investors service  inc and or s p 
our investment guidelines require that the average credit quality of our portfolio will be aa aa and that no more than of our investment portfolio s market value shall be invested in securities rated below bbb baa we also limit our exposure to any single issuer to or less of our portfolio s market value at the time of purchase  with the exception of us government and agency securities 
as of december   the average credit quality of our investment portfolio was aa  and all fixed income securities held were investment grade 
we are also exposed to the credit risk of our insurance and reinsurance brokers to whom we make claims payments for insureds and our reinsureds  as well as to the credit risk of our reinsurers and retrocessionaires who assume business from us 
as of december   our los s and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from reinsurers balance was million 
to mitigate the risk of nonpayment of amounts due under these arrangements  we have established business and financial standards for reinsure r and broker approval  incorporating ratings by major rating agencies and considering the financial condition of the counterparty and the current market information 
in addition  we monitor concentrations of credit risk arising from our reinsurers  regularly review our reinsurers financial strength ratings and obtain letters of credit to collateralize balances due 
we are also exposed to credit risk relating to our premiums receivabl e balance 
as of december   our premiums receivable balance was million 
we believe that credit risk exposure related to these balances is mitigated by several factors  including but not limited to credit monitoring controls performed as part of the underwriting process and monitoring of aged receivable balances 
in addition  as the majority of our insurance and reinsurance contracts provide the right to offset the premiums receivable against losses payable  we believe that the credit risk in this area is substantially reduced 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the effects of inflation could cause the severity of claim costs to increase in the future 
our estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions  including those relating to inflation  about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above our estimated reserves that are established for these claims  we will be required to increase reserves for losses and loss expenses with a corresponding reduction in our earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately determined until claims are ultimately settled
