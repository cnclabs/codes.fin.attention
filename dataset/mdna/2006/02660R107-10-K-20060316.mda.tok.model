item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies that are critical to the presentation of our financial statements and that require critical accounting estimates by management 
mortgage backed securities we record our mortgage backed securities at fair value 
the fair values of our mortgage backed securities are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets in these financial instruments 
mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or aggregate market value 
for mortgage loans held for sale that are hedged with forward sale commitments  the carrying value is adjusted for the change in market during the time the hedge was deemed to be highly effective 
the market value is determined by outstanding commitments from investors or current yield requirements calculated on an aggregate basis 
mortgage loans held for investment mortgage loans held for investment are carried at the aggregate of their remaining unpaid principal balances  plus net deferred origination costs  less any related charge offs and allowance for loan losses 
our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  adverse circumstances which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying real estate collateral and current market conditions within the geographic areas surrounding the underlying real estate 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provision to loan losses charged to income and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
mortgage servicing rights msrs when we acquire servicing assets through either purchase or origination of loans and sell or securitize those loans with servicing assets retained  the total cost of the loans is allocated to the servicing assets and the loans without the servicing assets based on their relative fair values 
the amount attributable to the servicing assets is capitalized as msrs on the consolidated balance sheets 
the msrs are amortized to expense in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
the msrs are assessed for impairment based on the fair value of those assets 
we estimate the fair value of the servicing assets by obtaining market information from a primary msr broker 
when the book value of capitalized servicing assets exceeds their fair value  impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance 
in determining impairment  the mortgage servicing portfolio is stratified by the predominant risk characteristic of the underlying mortgage loans 
we have determined that the predominant risk characteristic is the interest rate on the underlying loan 
we measure impairment for each stratum by comparing the estimated fair value to the recorded book value 
temporary impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance and amortization expense in the period of occurrence 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our msrs for other than temporary impairment to determine if the carrying value before the application of the valuation allowance is recoverable 
we receive a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of our msrs assuming a basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates from an independent msr broker 
the fair value estimate includes changes in market assumptions that would be expected given the increase in mortgage rates eg  prepayment speeds would be lower 
we believe this basis point increase in mortgage rates to be an appropriate threshold for determining the recoverability of the temporary impairment because that size rate increase is foreseeable and consistent with historical mortgage rate fluctuations 
when using this instantaneous change in rates  if the fair value of the strata of msrs is estimated to increase to a point where all of the impairment would be recovered  the impairment is considered to be temporary 
when we determine that a portion of the msrs is not recoverable  the related msrs and the previously established valuation allowance are correspondingly reduced to reflect other than temporary impairment 
derivative assets and derivative liabilities our mortgage committed pipeline includes interest rate lock commitments irlcs that have been extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria and have locked their terms and rates 
irlcs associated with loans expected to be sold are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
the fair value of the irlcs initiated on or before march  is determined by an estimate of the ultimate gain on sale of the loans  including the value of msrs  net of estimated net costs remaining to originate the loan and any net deferred origination costs 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides industry guidance which changed the timing of recognition of msrs for irlcs initiated after march  in sab no 
 the sec stated that the value of expected future cash flows related to servicing rights should be excluded when determining the fair value of derivative irlcs 
under the new policy  the value of the expected future cash flows related to servicing rights is not recognized until the underlying loans are sold 
we use other derivative instruments  including mortgage forward delivery contracts and treasury futures options  to economically hedge the irlcs  which are also classified and accounted for as free standing derivatives and thus are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
we use mortgage forward delivery contracts designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge of our agency eligible conforming fixed rate loans and most of our non conforming fixed rate loans held for sale 
at the inception of the hedge  we formally document the relationship between the forward delivery contracts and the mortgage inventory  as well as our objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions 
in the case of our conventional conforming fixed rate loan products  the notional amount of the forward delivery contracts  along with the underlying rate and terms of the contracts  are equivalent to the unpaid principal amount of the mortgage inventory being hedged  hence  the forward delivery contracts effectively fix the forward sales price and thereby substantially eliminate interest rate and price risk to us 
we classify and account for these forward delivery contracts as fair value hedges 
the derivatives are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded to current earnings 
when the hedges are deemed to be highly effective  the book value of the hedged loans held for sale is adjusted for its change in fair value during the hedge period 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure when financing our mortgage backed securities and certain arm loans 
certain swap agreements accounted for as cash flow hedges and certain swap agreements not designated as cash flow hedges are both carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our swap agreements are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets in these financial instruments or by third party pricing services 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets stemming from business acquisitions  including identifiable intangibles 
we test for impairment  at least annually  by comparing the fair value of goodwill  as determined by using a discounted cash flow method  with its carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
the discounted cash flow calculation related to our loan origination segment includes a forecast of the expected future loan originations and the related revenues and expenses 
the discounted cash flow calculation related to our mortgage holdings segment includes a forecast of the expected future net interest income  gain on mortgage backed securities and the related revenues and expenses 
these cash flows are discounted using a rate that is estimated to be a weighted average cost of capital for similar companies 
we further test to ensure that the fair value of all our business units does not exceed our total market capitalization

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had arrangements to enter into reverse repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with fourteen different financial institutions and had borrowed funds from nine of these firms 
because we borrow money under these agreements based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities  and because changes in interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mortgage backed securities  our borrowing ability under these agreements could be limited and lenders could initiate margin calls in the event interest rates change or the value of our mortgage backed securities declines for other reasons 
as of december   we had billion of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average borrowing rate of before the impact of interest rate swaps and a weighted average remaining maturity of four months 
to originate a mortgage loan  we draw against either a billion sln commercial paper program  a billion pre purchase facility with ubs real estate securities inc ubs  a facility of billion with bear stearns  a billion bank syndicated facility led by bank of america  na which includes a million term loan facility which we use to finance our msrs  a facility of million with morgan stanley bank morgan stanley  a million facility with ixis real estate capital  inc formerly cdc mortgage capital inc ixis  an early purchase program facility with countrywide home loans  inc countrywide and a facility of billion with calyon new york branch calyon 
the bank of america  ixis  morgan stanley and calyon facilities are committed facilities 
in addition  we have a gestation facility with greenwich capital financial products  inc greenwich 
these facilities are secured by the mortgages owned by us and by certain of our other assets 
advances drawn under the facilities bear interest at rates that vary depending on the type of mortgages securing the advances 
these loans are subject to sublimits  advance rates and terms that vary depending on the type of securing mortgages and the ratio of our liabilities to our tangible net worth 
at march   the aggregate outstanding balance under the commercial paper program was billion  the aggregate outstanding balance under the warehouse facilities was billion  the aggregate outstanding balance in drafts payable was million and the aggregate maximum amount available for additional borrowings was billion 
the documents governing our warehouse facilities contain a number of compensating balance requirements and restrictive financial and other covenants that  among other things  require us to adhere to a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth and liquidity  as well as to comply with applicable regulatory and investor requirements 
the facility agreements also contain covenants limiting the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer or sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business and to create liens on the collateral without obtaining the prior consent of the lenders  which consent may not be unreasonably withheld 
in addition  under our warehouse facilities  we cannot continue to finance a mortgage loan that we hold if o the loan is rejected as unsatisfactory for purchase by the ultimate investor and has exceeded its permissible day warehouse period  o we fail to deliver the applicable mortgage note or other documents evidencing the loan within the requisite time period  o the underlying property that secures the loan has sustained a casualty loss in excess of of its appraised value  or o the loan ceases to be an eligible loan as determined pursuant to the applicable facility agreement 
as of december   our aggregate warehouse facility borrowings were billion including million of borrowings under a working capital sub limit and our outstanding drafts payable were million  compared to million in aggregate warehouse facility borrowings including million of borrowings under a working capital sub limit and outstanding drafts payable of million as of december  at december   our loans held for sale were billion and our loans held for investment were billion compared to loans held for sale of billion at december  in addition to the warehouse facilities  we have purchase and sale agreements with ubs  greenwich capital and countrywide 
these agreements allow us to accelerate the sale of our mortgage loan inventory  resulting in a more effective use of the warehouse facility 
aggregate amounts sold and being held under these agreements at december  and december  were billion and million  respectively 
aggregate amounts so held under these agreements at march  were billion 
these agreements are not committed facilities and may be terminated at the discretion of the counterparties 
we make certain representations and warranties under the purchase and sale agreements regarding  among other things  the loans compliance with laws and regulations  their conformity with the ultimate investors underwriting standards and the accuracy of information 
in the event of a breach of these representations or warranties or in the event of an early payment default  we may be required to repurchase the loans and or indemnify the investor for damages caused by that breach 
we have implemented strict procedures to ensure quality control and conformity to underwriting standards and minimize the risk of being required to repurchase loans 
from time to time we have been required to repurchase loans that we sold  however  the liability for the fair value of those obligations has been immaterial 
we also have a million term loan facility with a bank syndicate led by bank of america which we use to finance our msrs 
the term loan facility expires on august  interest is based on a spread to the libor and may be adjusted for earnings on escrow balances 
at december  and december   borrowings under our term loan facility were million and million  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion of proceeds from principal received from sales of mortgage loans held for sale  o billion of proceeds from securitizations of mortgage loans held for sale  o billion of principal proceeds from sales of mortgage backed securities  o billion increase in warehouse lines of credit  net  o billion increase in reverse repurchase agreements  net  and o billion of principal repayments of mortgage backed securities 
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion of origination of mortgage loans  o billion of purchases of mortgage backed securities  and o billion of additions to mortgage backed securities 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at december  our primary sources of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in reverse repurchase agreements  o billion increase in collateralized debt obligations  o million increase in commercial paper  and o million proceeds from issuance of common stock 
our primary uses of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   were as follows o billion increase in mortgage backed securities  o billion increase in mortgage loans held for sale  net  o million net decrease in warehouse lines of credit  and o million decrease in payable for mortgage backed securities purchased 
inflation for the period to  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
to the extent inflation increases in the future  interest rates will also likely rise  which would reduce the number of loans we originate 
such a reduction could adversely affect our future results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are reasonably likely to be material to investors 
commitments we had the following commitments excluding derivative financial instruments at december  less than total year years years after years in thousands warehouse liabilities   commercial paper   reverse repurchase agreements   collateralized debt obligations    trust preferred securities   notes payable      operating leases     risk management movements in interest rates can pose a major risk to the company in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
the company depends on substantial borrowings to conduct its business 
these borrowings are all done at variable interest rate terms  which will increase as short term interest rates rise 
additionally  when interest rates rise  loans held for sale  loans held for investment and any applications in process with locked in rates decrease in value 
to preserve the value of such fixed rate loans or applications in process with locked in rates  agreements are executed for mandatory loan sales to be settled at future dates with fixed prices 
these sales take the form of forward sales of mortgage backed securities 
when interest rates decline  fallout may occur as a result of customers withdrawing their applications 
in those instances  the company may be required to purchase loans at current market prices to fulfill existing mandatory loan sale agreements  thereby incurring losses upon sale 
additionally  when interest rates decline  the interest income we receive from our mortgage loans held for investment as well as mortgage loans held for sale will decrease 
the company uses an interest rate hedging program to manage these risks 
through this program  mortgage backed securities are purchased and sold forward and options are acquired on treasury futures contracts 
in the event that the company does not deliver into the forward delivery commitments or exercise its option contracts  the instruments can be settled on a net basis 
net settlement entails paying or receiving cash based upon the change in market value of the existing instrument 
all forward delivery commitments and option contracts to buy securities are to be contractually settled within nine months of the balance sheet date 
the company s hedging program contains an element of risk because the counterparties to its mortgage and treasury securities transactions may be unable to meet their obligations 
while the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty  it is exposed to potential credit losses in the event the counterparty fails to perform 
the company s exposure to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty is the difference between the contract and the current market price 
the company minimizes its credit risk exposure by limiting the counterparties to well capitalized banks and securities dealers who meet established credit and capital guidelines 
movements in interest rates also impact the value of msrs 
when interest rates decline  the loans underlying the msrs are generally expected to prepay faster  which reduces the market value of the msrs 
the company considers the expected increase in loan origination volumes and the resulting additional origination related income as a natural hedge against the expected change in the value of msrs 
lower mortgage rates generally reduce the fair value of the msrs  as increased prepayment speeds are highly correlated with lower levels of mortgage interest rates 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure when financing its arm loans and its mortgage backed securities 
the company generally borrows money based on short term interest rates by entering into borrowings with maturity terms of less than one year  and frequently nine to twelve months 
the company s arm loans and mortgage backed securities financing vehicles generally have an interest rate that reprices based on frequency terms of one to twelve months 
the company s mortgage backed securities have an initial fixed interest rate period of three to five years 
when the company enters into a swap agreement  it generally agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest and to receive a variable interest rate  generally based on libor 
these swap agreements have the effect of converting the company s variable rate debt into fixed rate debt over the life of the swap agreements 
these instruments are used as a cost effective way to lengthen the average repricing period of the company s variable rate and short term borrowings such that the average repricing of the borrowings more closely matches the average repricing of the company s mortgage backed securities 
the company s duration gap was approximately one month on december the following tables summarize our interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  and december  december  carrying estimated amount fair value assets mortgage backed securities   derivative assets   mortgage loans held for sale  net   mortgage loans held for investment  net   mortgage servicing rights  net   liabilities reverse repurchase agreements   collateralized debt obligations   derivative liabilities   december  carrying estimated amount fair value assets mortgage backed securities   derivative assets   mortgage loans held for sale  net   mortgage servicing rights  net   liabilities reverse repurchase agreements   collateralized debt obligations   derivative liabilities   derivative assets includes interest rate lockcommitments irlcs to fund mortgage loans

these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimates of future cash flows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
a further discussion of the methods and assumptions we use to estimate the above financial instruments is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the eitf reached a consensus on an other than temporary impairment model for debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and cost method investments 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp no 
eitf  effective date of paragraphs of eitf this fsp delayed the effective date of the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of issue in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp nullifies certain requirements of issue and supersedes eitf abstracts  topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
based on the clarification provided in fsp fas and fas  the amount of any other than temporary impairment that needs to be recognized will continue to be dependent on market conditions  the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances relative to an investee and an entity s intent and ability to hold the impaired investment at the time of the valuation 
fsp fas and fas are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this fsp did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions including employee stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans be recognized as an expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
under sfas no 
r  the related compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which expresses views of the sec staff about the application of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
requires only that the expense relating to employee stock options be disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r will replace sfas no 
and supersede apb opinion no 
while sfas no 
r was originally to have been effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after june   the sec  in april  deferred the compliance date to the first annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas no 
r and the provisions of sab no 
are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements when they are adopted  under the modified prospective method  on january   however  the company continues to assess the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on the classification of tax deductions for stock based compensation in the statement of cash flows 
in addition  the company s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of the company s stock price and the timing and level of stock option exercise activity 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the interpretation 
this proposed interpretation would clarify the accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
an enterprise would be required to recognize  in its financial statements  the best estimate of the impact of a tax position  if that tax position is probable of being sustained if audited by a tax authority based solely on the technical merits of the position 
individual tax positions that fail to meet the interpretation s recognition threshold would result in either a a reduction in the deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or b an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or the reduction of an income tax refund receivable 
the fasb expects to issue the interpretation  along with any amendments  in the first quarter of management of the company does not believe the adoption of this currently proposed interpretation will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this exposure draft would amend fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and would require that all separately recognized servicing rights be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities  this exposure draft would permit the company to choose either to report servicing assets and liabilities at fair value or at amortized cost 
under the fair value approach  servicing assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
under the amortized cost method  servicing assets and liabilities are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and are assessed for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date 
in november  the fasb announced the effective date of the exposure draft had been delayed and would be effective for fiscal years beginning after september  the company is currently in the process of determining which methodology to use to value recognized servicing assets and liabilities and therefore has not yet determined the potential impact of the exposure draft on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for transfers of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this exposure draft would amend fasb statement no 
by addressing the criteria necessary for obtaining sales accounting on the transfer of all or a portion of financial assets as well as the requirements for qualification as a qualified special purpose entity qspe 
the proposed changes to the criteria for obtaining sales accounting include a requirement that all arrangements or agreements  including those entered into subsequent to the sale  made in connection with the transfer of financial assets be considered in the determination of whether the financial assets were legally isolated from the transferor and its consolidated affiliates  the establishment of additional conditions for obtaining sales treatment on the transfer of a portion of a financial asset and the requirement that a transferee maintain the right to pledge or exchange the assets it receives and no condition exists that constrains the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange its assets  or provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor 
the proposed changes to the requirements for qualifying as a qspe include prohibiting a qspe from holding equity instruments  unless the equity instruments were received as a result of the efforts to collect its financial assets  as well as a requirement to evaluate whether a combination of involvements with a qspe provide the holder of those involvements with an opportunity to obtain a more than trivial incremental benefit relative to the benefit that would be obtained if separate parties had those same involvements 
in december  the fasb announced the effective date of the exposure draft had been delayed 
the final statement is expected to be issued in the second quarter of the company is evaluating the potential impact of the exposure draft on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
key provisions of sfas no 
include a broad fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest only strips and principal only strips from derivative accounting under paragraph of fas thereby narrowing such exception  a requirement that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  clarification that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and elimination of the prohibition on a qspe holding passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument 
in general  these changes will reduce the operational complexity associated with bifurcating embedded derivatives  and increase the number of beneficial interests in securitization transactions  including interest only strips and principal only strips  required to be accounted for in accordance with fas sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements  including financial statements for any interim period for that fiscal year 
management does not believe that sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the eitf agenda committee released transactions involving the purchase of financial assets and simultaneous repurchase of the same financial assets with the seller 
this potential technical interpretation of gaap relates to the accounting for transactions where assets are purchased from a counterparty and simultaneously financed through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty  and whether these transactions create a derivative for the security purchase and a deposit receivable as part of the repurchase agreement  instead of the acquisition of assets with related financing recorded on the balance sheet 
the company has engaged in a limited number of transactions of this nature and currently accounts for these transactions as a purchase and subsequent financing 
as of december   the company had billion of mortgage backed securities  of which approximately million have been acquired and financed with the same counterparty 
if the company were to change its current accounting based on this interpretation  management does not believe there would be a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
