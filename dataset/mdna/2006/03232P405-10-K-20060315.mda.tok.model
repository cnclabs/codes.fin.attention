overview we develop  acquire and operate practice based ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physician practice groups 
as of december   we owned a majority interest or greater in surgery centers 
the following table presents the changes in the number of surgery centers in operation  under development and under letter of intent for the years ended december   and a center is deemed to be under development when a limited partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of the year new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers disposed centers in operation  end of the year centers under development  end of the year development centers awaiting regulatory approval  end of year average number of continuing centers in operation  during year centers under letter of intent  end of year of the surgery centers in operation at december   centers performed gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures  centers performed ophthalmology surgery procedures  five centers performed orthopedic procedures and six centers performed procedures in more than one specialty 
the other partner or member in each limited partnership or limited liability company is generally an entity owned by physicians who perform procedures at the center 
we intend to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties and through future same center growth 
our growth targets for include the acquisition or development of to additional surgery centers and the achievement of annual same center revenue growth of to 
while we generally own of the entities that own the surgery centers  and up to in certain instances  our consolidated statements of earnings include of the results of operations of the entities  reduced by the minority partners share of the net earnings or loss of the surgery center entities 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sources of revenues substantially all of our revenues are derived from facility fees charged for surgical procedures performed in our surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly by the physicians 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third party medical service payors 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers  such as those in which we own a majority interest  depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients 
the amount of payment a surgery center receives for its services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors  as well as other factors over which we have no control  including medicare and medicaid regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions of third party payors 
we derived approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  from governmental healthcare programs  primarily medicare 
the medicare program currently pays ambulatory surgery centers in accordance with predetermined fee schedules 
effective april   our surgery centers received a price decrease from medicare 
on february   the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of  which includes a provision that limits medicare reimbursement for certain procedures performed at ascs to the amounts paid to hospital outpatient departments under the medicare opd fee schedule for those procedures beginning in this act will negatively impact the reimbursement of after cataract laser surgery procedures performed at our ophthalmology ascs  the result of which will be an approximately reduction in our net earnings per share  beginning in we believe the after cataract laser surgery procedure is the only procedure performed in significant numbers in our ascs for which the current reimbursement rate exceeds the medicare opd fee schedule amount 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amsurg and our subsidiaries and the majority owned limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which our wholly owned subsidiaries are the general partner or majority member 
consolidation of such limited partnerships and limited liability companies is necessary  as our wholly owned subsidiaries have or more of the financial interest  are the general partner or majority member with all the duties  rights and responsibilities thereof  are responsible for the day to day management of the limited partnership or limited liability company and have control of the entities 
the responsibilities of our minority partners are to supervise the delivery of medical services  with their rights being restricted to those that protect their financial interests  such as approval of the acquisition of significant assets or the incurrence of debt which they are required to guarantee on a pro rata basis based upon their respective ownership interests 
intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
surgery center profits are allocated to our minority partners in proportion to their individual ownership percentages and reflected in the aggregate as minority interest 
the minority partners of our surgery center limited partnerships and limited liability companies typically are organized as general partnerships  limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are not subject to federal income tax 
each minority partner shares in the pre tax earnings of the surgery center in which it holds minority ownership 
accordingly  the minority interest in each of our limited partnerships and limited liability companies is determined on a pre tax basis and presented before earnings before income taxes in order to present that amount of earnings on which we must determine our tax expense 
in addition  distributions from our limited partnerships and limited liability companies are made to both our subsidiary general partners and majority members and our minority partners on a pre tax basis 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as described above  we are a holding company and our ability to service corporate debt is dependent upon distributions from our limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
positive operating cash flows of individual centers are the sole source of cash used to make distributions to our subsidiary general partners and majority members as well as to our minority partners  which we are obligated to make on a monthly basis in accordance with each limited partnership s and limited liability company s partnership or operating agreement 
accordingly  distributions to our minority partners are included in our financial statements as a component of our cash flows from operating activities 
we operate in one reportable business segment  the ownership and operation of ambulatory surgery centers 
revenue recognition 
center revenues consist of billing for the use of the centers facilities  or facility fees  directly to the patient or third party payor  and in limited instances  billing for anesthesia services 
such revenues are recognized when the related surgical procedures are performed 
revenues exclude any amounts billed for physicians surgical services  which are billed separately by the physicians to the patient or third party payor 
allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual adjustments from third party medical service payors  which we estimate based on historical trends of the surgery centers cash collections and contractual write offs  accounts receivable agings  established fee schedules  contracts with payors and procedure statistics 
in addition  we must estimate allowances for bad debt expense using similar information and analysis 
these estimates are recorded and monitored monthly for each of our surgery centers as additional revenue is recognized 
our ability to accurately estimate contractual adjustments is dependent upon and supported by the fact that our surgery centers perform and bill for limited types of procedures  that the range of reimbursement for those procedures within each surgery center specialty is very narrow and that payments are typically received within to days of billing 
in addition  our surgery centers are not required to file cost reports  and therefore  we have no risk of unsettled amounts from third party payors 
these estimates are not  however  established from billing system generated contractual adjustments based on fee schedules for the patient s insurance plan for each patient encounter 
while we believe that our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense are adequate  if the actual contractual adjustments and write offs are in excess of our estimates  our results of operations may be overstated 
during the years ended december   and  we had no significant adjustments to our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense related to prior periods 
at december  and  net accounts receivable reflected allowances for contractual adjustments of million and million  respectively  and allowances for bad debt expense of million and million  respectively 
the increase in our contractual allowance is primarily related to allowances established for new centers acquired during  which had required allowances significantly in excess of our average center at the date of purchase 
at december  and  we had and days  respectively  outstanding reflected in our gross accounts receivable 
purchase price allocation 
we allocate the respective purchase price of our acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations 
the allocation of purchase price involves first determining the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
secondly  the excess amount of purchase price is to be allocated to unidentifiable intangible assets goodwill 
a significant portion of each surgery center s purchase price historically has been allocated to goodwill due to the nature of the businesses acquired  the pricing and structure of our acquisitions and the absence of other factors indicating any significant value which could be attributable to separately identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill 
we apply the provision of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis 
impairment of carrying value will be evaluated more frequently if certain indicators are encountered 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component  with the fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired 
we have determined that we have one operating as well as one reportable segment 
for impairment testing purposes  our centers each qualify as components of that operating segment 
because they and have similar economic characteristics  they are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
we completed our annual impairment test as required by sfas no 
as of december   and have determined that it is not necessary to recognize impairment in our goodwill 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations our revenues are directly related to the number of procedures our surgery centers perform 
our overall growth in procedure volume is impacted directly by the increase in the number of surgery centers in operation and the growth in procedure volume at existing centers 
we increase our number of surgery centers through both acquisitions and developments 
procedure growth at any existing center may result from additional contracts entered into with third party payors  increased market share of the associated medical practice of our physician partners  additional physicians utilizing the center and or scheduling and operating efficiencies gained at the surgery center 
a significant measurement of how much our revenues grow from year to year for existing centers is our same center revenue percentage 
we define our same center group each year as those centers which contain full year to date operations in both comparable reporting periods  including the expansion of the number of operating centers within a partnership or limited liability company 
our same center group  comprised of centers  had revenue growth of 
our same center group in will be comprised of centers  which constitutes approximately of our total base of centers 
we expect our same center revenue growth to be to in expenses directly and indirectly related to procedures performed at our surgery centers include clinical and administrative salaries and benefits  supply cost and other operating expenses such as linen cost  repair and maintenance of equipment  billing fees and bad debt expense 
the majority of our corporate salary and benefits cost is associated directly with the number of centers we own and manage and tends to grow in proportion to the growth of our centers in operation 
our centers and corporate offices also incur costs that are more fixed in nature  such as lease expense  legal fees  property taxes  utilities and depreciation and amortization 
surgery center profits are allocated to our minority partners in proportion to their individual ownership percentages and reflected in the aggregate as minority interest 
the minority partners of our surgery center limited partnerships and limited liability companies typically are organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are not subject to federal income tax 
each minority partner shares in the pre tax earnings of the surgery center of which it is a minority partner 
accordingly  the minority interest in each of our surgery center limited partnerships and limited liability companies is determined on a pre tax basis and presented before earnings before income taxes in order to present that amount of earnings on which we must determine our tax expense 
our interest expense results primarily from our borrowings used to fund acquisition and development activity  as well as interest incurred on capital leases 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return and numerous state income tax returns with varying tax rates 
our income tax expense reflects the blending of these rates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table shows certain statement of earnings items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and revenues operating expenses salaries and benefits supply cost other operating expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income minority interest interest expense  net of interest income earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations loss earnings from operations of discontinued interests in surgery centers  net of income tax loss gain on sale of discontinued interests in surgery centers  net of income tax loss earnings from discontinued operations net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the additional revenues resulted primarily from centers acquired or opened in  which contributed million of additional revenues due to having a full period of operations in  centers acquired in  which generated million in revenues  million of revenue growth recognized by centers in our same center group  reflecting a increase  primarily as a result of procedure growth  and three centers developed and opened in  which generated million in revenues 
our procedures increased by  or  to  in from  in the difference between our procedure growth and revenue growth was the result of an increased number of gastroenterology procedures over other types of procedures  primarily as a result of the addition of new gastroenterology centers 
gastroenterology procedures receive a lower average reimbursement per procedure than our average reimbursement per procedure in staff at newly acquired and developed centers  as well as the additional staffing required at existing centers due to increased volume  resulted in a increase in salaries and benefits at our surgery centers in we experienced a increase in salaries and benefits at our corporate offices during over the increase in corporate office salaries and benefits in over was primarily due to additional corporate employees hired to manage 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our additional centers in operation and an increase in corporate incentive compensation due to the large number of acquisitions and developments closed in salaries and benefits increased in total by to million in from million in salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues increased in over because of increases in wages and benefits in excess of revenue growth 
supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase was the result of additional procedure volume 
our average supply cost per procedure in was compared to in the decrease in cost per procedure in resulted primarily from an increased percentage of gastroenterology procedures  which have a lower cost per procedure than ophthalmology procedures 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from this increase was net of a million non cash loss on a long term receivable recognized in due to the establishment of a reserve for the estimated uncollectible portion 
the note receivable originated from the sale of a physician practice in in connection with our exit from that line of business 
the additional expense in the period resulted primarily from centers acquired during  which resulted in an increase of million in other operating expenses  additional centers acquired in  which resulted in an increase of million in other operating expenses due to having a full period of operations in the  an increase of million in other operating expenses from our same center group resulting primarily from additional procedure volume and general inflationary cost increases  and three centers developed and opened during  which resulted in an increase of million in other operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the newly developed surgery centers in operation  which have an initially higher level of depreciation expense due to their construction costs 
we anticipate further increases in operating expenses in  primarily due to additional start up centers expected to be placed in operation and additional acquired centers 
typically  a start up center will incur start up losses while under development and during its initial months of operation and will experience lower revenues and operating margins than an established center 
this typically continues until the case load at the center grows to a more normal operating level  which generally is expected to occur within months after the center opens 
at december   we had five centers under development  three development centers awaiting approval of certificates of need and seven centers that had been open for less than one year 
minority interest in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest decreased to in from in as a result of our minority partners sharing in reduced center profit margins caused by lower same center revenue growth and new center development activity 
interest expense increased million in  or  from  primarily due to additional long term debt outstanding during resulting from acquisition activity and stock repurchase programs completed in as well as an increase in interest rates 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we recognized income tax expense from continuing operations of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was and  respectively  of earnings before income taxes  and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
during  we anticipate that our effective tax rate will range between and 
because we deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes only  approximately to of our overall income tax expense is deferred  which results in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability  which would only be due in part or in whole upon the disposition of a portion or all of our surgery centers 
during  we sold our interests in two surgery centers 
in addition  one center was rendered non operational by hurricane katrina in august and was abandoned 
in three separate transactions in  we sold our interests 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in four surgery centers 
these centers results of operations and gains and losses associated with their dispositions have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
loss from discontinued operations  including loss from operations and disposition  was approximately million in  attributable primarily to the center affected by the hurricane 
earnings from discontinued operations  including earnings from operations and gain on dispositions  was million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the additional revenues resulted primarily from nine centers acquired or opened in  which contributed million of additional revenues due to having a full year of operations in  ten centers acquired during  which generated million in revenues  million of revenue growth recognized by centers in our same center group  reflecting a increase  primarily as a result of procedure growth  and five centers developed and opened in  which generated million in revenues 
our procedures increased by  or  to  in from  in staff at newly acquired and developed centers  as well as the additional staffing required at existing centers due to increased volume  resulted in a increase in salaries and benefits at our surgery centers 
in order to provide appropriate corporate management for the additional centers  we increased our number of corporate employees during however  because certain financial targets were not met  we paid less incentive compensation for as compared to as a result  we experienced no significant changes in our corporate salary and benefit expense in as compared to salaries and benefits increased in total by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase was commensurate with the additional procedure volume and reflective of a comparable increase in revenues in as compared to in our average supply cost per procedure in and was and  respectively 
the decrease in cost per procedure in resulted primarily from an increased percentage of gastroenterology procedures  which have a lower cost per procedure than ophthalmology procedures 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from the additional expense in the period resulted primarily from nine additional centers acquired or opened in  which resulted in an increase of million in other operating expenses due to having a full year of operations in  ten centers acquired during  which resulted in an increase of million in other operating expenses  and five centers developed and opened in  which resulted in an increase of million in other operating expenses 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in a significant factor which contributed to this decrease was a reduction of bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues from to due to our concentrated efforts to improve our cash collection processes 
in addition  we had certain cost reductions in medical malpractice insurance  primarily as a result of more favorable loss history  and repair and maintenance costs in compared to on a per center basis 
included in other operating expenses in is a non cash loss on a long term note receivable of million due to our establishment of a reserve for our estimate of the uncollectible portion of a long term note receivable 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the newly developed surgery centers in operation  which have an initially higher level of depreciation expense due to their construction costs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest remained comparable at in  versus in interest expense increased approximately  in  or  from  primarily due to additional long term debt outstanding during resulting primarily from acquisition activity and our stock repurchase program 
we recognized income tax expense from continuing operations of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was and  respectively  of earnings before income taxes and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
because we deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes only  a larger portion of our overall income tax expense is considered deferred income taxes  which results in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability  which would only be due in part or in whole upon the disposition of a portion or all of our surgery centers 
in three separate transactions in  we sold our interests in four surgery centers and recognized a combined after tax gain of million 
the centers results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
the net earnings derived from the operations of these centers were million and million in and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  operating activities for generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million in the increase in operating cash flow activity resulted primarily from an additional million in net earnings from continuing operations  resulting primarily from additional centers in operation 
operating cash flow in and contained million and million  respectively  in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the principle source of our operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from governmental payors  commercial payors and individuals 
each of our surgery centers bills for services as delivered  either electronically or in paper form  usually within several days following the delivery of the procedure 
generally  unpaid amounts that are days past due are rebilled based on a standard set of procedures 
if amounts remain uncollected after days  our surgery centers proceed with a series of late notice notifications until amounts are either collected  contractually written off in accordance with contracted rates or determined to be uncollectible  typically after to days 
receivables determined to be uncollectible are written off and such amounts are applied to our estimate of allowance for bad debts as previously established in accordance with our policy for allowance for bad debt expense see critical accounting policies allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
the amount of actual write offs of account balances for each of our surgery centers is continuously compared to established allowances for bad debt to ensure that such allowances are adequate 
at december  and  our accounts receivable represented and days of revenue outstanding  respectively 
during  we had total capital expenditures of million  which included million for acquisitions of interests in practice based ambulatory surgery centers  including million in purchase price obligations that were paid in  million for new or replacement property at existing surgery centers  including  in new capital leases  and million for surgery centers under development 
we used cash flow from operations to fund approximately of our cash obligations for our acquisition and development activity  and we received approximately million from capital contributions of our minority partners to fund their proportionate share of development activity 
borrowings under long term debt were used to fund the remaining portion of our obligations 
at december   we and our limited partnerships and limited liability companies had unfunded construction and equipment purchase commitments for centers under development or under renovation of approximately million  which we intend to fund through additional borrowings of long term debt  operating cash flow and capital contributions by minority partners 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during  we received approximately million from the sale of our interests in two surgery centers 
during  notes receivable decreased by million  primarily due to payments on a note receivable related to the sale of a surgery center in the note is secured by a pledge of a ownership interest in the center  is guaranteed by the physician partners at the center and is due in installments through the balance of this note at december  was million 
during  we had net borrowings on long term debt of million 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which permits us to borrow up to million to  among other things  finance our acquisition and development projects and stock repurchase programs at a rate equal to  at our option  the prime rate plus up to  libor plus to or a combination thereof 
the loan agreement also provides for a fee of to of unused commitments 
the revolving credit facility also prohibits the payment of dividends and contains covenants relating to the ratio of debt to net worth  operating performance and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance in all material respects with all covenants at december  borrowings under the credit facility are due on april  and are secured primarily by a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our limited partnerships and our membership interests in the limited liability companies 
we incurred approximately  in deferred financing fees during  primarily associated with an amendment to our credit facility in april during  we received approximately million from the exercise of options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans 
the tax benefit received from the exercise of those options was approximately million 
the following schedule summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt  including interest purchase price payable capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases  including renewal option periods construction in progress commitments total contractual cash obligations our long term debt may increase based on acquisition activity expected to occur in the future 
we may use our operating cash flow to repay existing long term debt under our credit facility prior to its maturity date 
in addition  as of march   we had available under our revolving credit facility million for acquisition borrowings 
our credit facility matures on april  based upon our current operations and anticipated growth  we believe our operating cash flow and borrowing capacity will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next to months 
in addition to acquiring and developing ascs  we may from time to time consider other acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
such acquisitions  joint ventures or other opportunities may require additional external financing 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent accounting pronouncements beginning january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment revised 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee and non employee services in exchange for the company s equity instruments or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity securities or may be settled by the issuance of these securities 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation using accounting principles board opinion no 
and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value method 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and will apply the black scholes method of valuation in determining share based compensation expense 
the impact of adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations in is expected to be approximately million  net of income taxes  based on unvested options at the time of adoption and an estimation of share based payments to be granted in in june  the financial accounting standards board ratified the emerging issues task force issue no 
 or eitf no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf no 
provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls  and should consolidate  a limited partnership or a similar entity 
eitf no 
is effective for all limited partnerships formed after june  and for any limited partnerships in existence on june  that modify their partnership agreements after that date 
eitf no 
is effective for all our partnerships beginning january  we have adopted the provisions of eitf no 
for any limited partnership agreements entered into or modified subsequent to june  we have evaluated our existing partnerships and have determined that the adoption of eitf no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our debt instruments are primarily indexed to the prime rate or libor 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in the table below provides information as of december  about our long term debt obligations based on maturity dates that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except percentage data fair value at years ended december  december  thereafter total fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate the difference in maturities of long term obligations and overall increase in total borrowings principally resulted from our borrowings associated with our acquisitions of surgery centers and stock repurchase programs 
the average interest rates on these borrowings at december  increased as compared to december  due to an overall increase in market rates
