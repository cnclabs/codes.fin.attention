net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million  an increase of million  or 
this increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the continued execution of our core strategy of investing to build our global brand awareness and penetrating existing channels 
during  net sales growth attributable to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation was million  which represented less than of net sales 
our largest channel continues to be retail  which increased million  or in the growth in our retail channel reflects our focus on targeted penetration of furniture retail stores in both our domestic and international markets 
additionally  we added new product offerings to our existing line in both our domestic and international markets in as described in our segments discussions below 
our direct channel increased while the healthcare and third party channels decreased  and  respectively 
the decrease in our third party channel was primarily due to persistent weakness in our international pillow business  mainly in asia 
while this business continues to recover  it has not returned to operating performance levels that we expected for the year 
consolidated pillow sales decreased approximately million from  primarily attributable to a decline in our international sales in asia to certain third party distributors 
although our net sales rose for the year ended december   our sales growth slowed considerably during  with net sales in the fourth quarter of increasing as compared to the fourth quarter of in particular  sales in our us retail channel were lower than expected as we faced a more challenging retail environment in the second half of we have undertaken several initiatives to accelerate domestic sales growth and otherwise strengthen our business in these initiatives include expanding our retail sales force in both the us and internationally and increasing our marketing investment around the world to continue building our brand awareness 
domestic 
domestic net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
our domestic retail channel continues to be our largest channel  with million in net sales for this is an increase of million  or over the prior year

international net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
the largest channel in our international segment continues to be our retail channel  which increased million  or  for the year ended december  the growth in retail sales is due to the addition of new stores to the channel and successful new product launches during the year

our direct  healthcare  and third party channels had sales decreases of   and  respectively 
the decrease in our direct channel is primarily related to the decision to change our direct sales operation in several european markets in favor of a modified version of the program that directs potential customers to furniture retail and department stores that sell our products 
our healthcare channel decreased primarily due to changes in government reimbursement policies in certain countries 
our third party channel decreased due to strategic changes in our international third party channel in asia that we implemented in order to protect our subsidiary distribution in the region 
international mattress sales increased million  or  for pillow sales decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease in pillow sales is primarily related to our efforts to limit cross importation into existing markets in asia 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in  an increase of million  or 
our margins are impacted by the relative rate of growth in our retail channel 
sales in our retail channel are generally at wholesale prices 
the overall shift in our product mix to mattresses is also a factor because our mattresses generally carry lower margins than our pillows 
we expect continued downward pressure on our margins as a result of the continued growth in our retail channel and in mattress sales 
our margins are also impacted by changes in our manufacturing capacity  which affects our utilization 
increases in shipping costs also reduced our margins in we began importing several mattress models from europe in the first quarter of  and we continued importing through the end of the third quarter in order to build the necessary stock levels of the eurobed that was introduced to the us during the year 
therefore  we incurred additional freight costs to bring this inventory from europe 
as a result of sales in the us growing at a slower rate than expected  increased productivity at our us manufacturing facility and the new capability to make eurobed mattresses in our us manufacturing facility  we will no longer be importing mattresses from denmark 
accordingly  as part of our current production plan  we began to reduce our inventory levels in the fourth quarter of and plan to continue to manage inventory levels in the future 
increases in raw materials costs also reduced our margin 
we currently believe there will continue to be cost pressures from the recent rise in chemical prices driven primarily by natural gas increases  and fuel surcharges for the transportation and delivery of our products 
we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of price increases through productivity and efficiency initiatives  including negotiated discounts for many of our chemical purchases  reverse auctions on certain material purchases  purchasing leverage on consolidated global buying  and implementation of warehousing and shipping efficiencies

however  as part of this rollout process  we discounted

the decrease as a percentage of sales was due to increased operating leverage from fixed administrative costs 
additionally  the costs of complying with sarbanes oxley requirements were substantially less than the prior year  when we were incurring the costs of first year compliance 
certain options granted during the year prior to the initial public offering have exercise prices that are less than the deemed market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant

we used a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering to redeem million of senior subordinated notes and to repay approximately million of indebtedness under our senior credit facility 
in conjunction with the january  redemption of the senior subordinated notes  we reflected the million redemption premium as a loss on debt extinguishment in the first quarter of total offering expenses were approximately million 
secondary public offering 
on november   tempur pedic international inc closed a secondary offering of million shares of its common stock  including the subsequent exercise in full of the underwriters overallotment option  at a price of per share 
all shares were sold by certain of the stockholders pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement originally entered into in november in connection with the acquisition of tempur world  inc we incurred million in expenses associated with this offering 
share repurchase program 
on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the common stock 
share repurchases under this program were made through open market transactions  negotiated purchases or otherwise  at times and in such amounts as we deemed appropriate 
during  we repurchased million shares  at a total cost of million 
we funded these share repurchases from borrowings under the senior credit facility and funds from operations 
on january   our board of directors amended the share repurchase program described above to increase the total authorization by an additional million resulting in a total authorization to purchase up to million of tempur pedic international inc s common stock 
accordingly  as of january   because we had already purchased million of shares under the program  we were authorized to purchase up to million of our common stock 
since january   we have repurchased an additional million shares at a total cost of million through february  the share repurchases have been and will continue to be funded from borrowings under the senior credit facility and funds from operations 
future liquidity sources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolvers 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources 
as of december   we had million in total long term debt outstanding  and our stockholders equity was million 
our significant debt service obligations could  under certain circumstances  have material consequences to our security holders 
total cash interest payments related to our borrowings are expected to be approximately million in based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our senior credit facility or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  are summarized below payment due by period contractual obligations in millions after total obligations long term debt operating leases capital expenditure commitments total factors that may affect future performance managing growth we have grown rapidly  with our net sales increasing from million in to million for our growth has placed  and will continue to place  a strain on our management  production  product distribution network  information systems and other resources 
in response to these challenges  management has continued to invest in increased production capacity  enhanced operating and financial infrastructure and systems and continued expansion of the human resources in our operations 
our expenditures for advertising and other marketing related activities are made as advertising rates are favorable to us and as the continued growth in the business allows us the ability to invest in building our brand 
competition participants in the mattress and pillow industries compete primarily on price  quality  brand name recognition  product availability and product performance 
we compete with a number of different types of mattress alternatives  including standard innerspring mattresses  other foam mattresses  waterbeds  futons  air beds and other air supported mattresses 
these alternative products are sold through a variety of channels  including furniture stores  specialty bedding stores  department stores  mass merchants  wholesale clubs  telemarketing programs  television infomercials and catalogs 
our largest competitors have significant financial  marketing and manufacturing resources and strong brand name recognition  and sell their products through broad and well established distribution channels 
additionally  we believe that a number of our significant competitors offer mattress products claimed to be similar to our tempur mattresses and pillows 
we are susceptible to competition from lower priced product offerings 
we provide strong channel profits to our retailers and distributors which management believes will continue to provide an attractive business model for our retailers and discourage them from carrying competing lower priced products 
significant growth opportunities our products are currently sold in approximately  furniture and bedding retail stores in the u 
s  out of a total of approximately  stores we have identified as appropriate targets 
within this addressable market of approximately  stores  our plan is to increase our total penetration to a total of  to  stores over time 
our products are also sold in approximately  furniture retail and department stores outside the us  out of a total of approximately  stores that we have identified as appropriate targets 
in addition  we have a significant installed pillow base in our asia market that we believe creates an opportunity to develop a successful mattress market 
we are continuing to develop products that are responsive to consumer demand in our markets internationally 
in addition to these growth opportunities  management believes that we currently supply only a small percentage of approximately  nursing homes and  hospitals in the us  with a collective bed count in excess of million 
clinical evidence indicates that our products are both effective and cost efficient for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers  or bed sores  a major problem for elderly and bed ridden patients 
a change in the us medicare and medicaid reimbursement policies toward prevention of bed sores and away from treatment could expand our growth potential in this market 

table of contents financial leverage as of december   we had million of long term debt outstanding  and our stockholders equity was million 
higher financial leverage makes us more vulnerable to general adverse competitive  economic and industry conditions 
we believe that operating margins combined with the inherent operating leverage in the business will enable us to continue de leveraging the business in a manner consistent with historical experience 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our senior credit facility  or otherwise  to enable us to de leverage the business 
exchange rates as a multinational company  we conduct our business in a wide variety of currencies and are therefore subject to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage a portion of the exposure to the risk of the eventual net cash inflows and outflows resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions between tempur pedic subsidiaries and their customers and suppliers  as well as between the tempur pedic subsidiaries themselves 
these hedging transactions may not succeed in managing our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures under part ii of this report 
foreign currency exchange rate movements also create a degree of risk by affecting the us dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into hedging transactions to hedge this risk 
consequently  our reported earnings and financial position could fluctuate materially as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses 
our outlook assumes no significant changes in currency values from current rates 
should currency rates change sharply  our results could be negatively impacted 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures under part ii of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management is responsible for our financial statements and has evaluated the accounting policies to be used in their preparation 
our management believes these policies are reasonable and appropriate 
the following discussion identifies those accounting policies that we believe are critical in the preparation of our financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies and the possibility that materially different amounts will be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires that the management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition our estimates of sales returns are a critical component of our revenue recognition 
we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  when we ship our products to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to them 
estimated sales returns are provided at the time of sale  based on our level of historical sales returns 
we allow returns for up to days following a sale  depending on the channel and promotion 
our level of sales returns differs by channel  with our direct channel typically experiencing the highest rate of returns 
our level of returns has been consistent with our estimates and has been improving steadily over the last year as our retail channel  which experiences lower returns than other sales channels  continues to grow as a percentage of overall net sales 
warranties cost of sales includes estimated costs to service warranty claims of our customers 
our estimate is based on our historical claims experience and extensive product testing that we perform from time to time 
we provide a year warranty for us sales and a year warranty for us sales on mattresses  each prorated for the last years 
because our products have not been in use by our customers for the full warranty period  we rely on 
table of contents the combination of historical experience and product testing for the development of our estimate for warranty claims 
our estimate of warranty claims could be adversely affected if our historical experience ultimately proves to be greater than the performance of the product in our product testing 
we also provide year to year warranties on pillows 
estimated future obligations related to these products are provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheets consists of the purchase price from the acquisition of tempur world  inc in november the tempur acquisition in excess of the estimated fair values of identifiable net assets as of the date of the tempur acquisition 
intangibles consist of tradenames for various brands under which our products are sold 
other intangibles include our customer database for our direct channel  process technology and the formulation of our pressure relieving tempur material 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas we perform an annual impairment test on all existing goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year 
we performed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of on all existing goodwill and no impairment existed as of december  if facts and circumstances lead our management to believe that one of our other amortized intangible assets may be impaired  we will evaluate the extent to which the related cost is recoverable by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be associated with that asset to the asset s carrying amount and write down that carrying amount to fair value to the extent necessary 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  different assumptions and judgments could result in different impairment  if any  of some or all of our recorded goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles of million as of december  and million as of december  in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  the asset is considered impaired and an expense is recorded in an amount required to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its then fair value 
although we believe that our estimates of cash flows in our application of sfas are reasonable  and based upon all available information  including historical cash flow data about the prior use of our assets  such estimates nevertheless require substantial judgments and are based upon material assumptions about future events 
income tax accounting income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred taxes are measured by applying the provisions of tax laws in effect at the balance sheet date 
we recognize deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets  and these deferred tax assets typically represent items deducted currently from operating income in the financial statements that will be deducted in future periods in tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  a valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized in future periods 
the valuation allowance is based  in part  on our estimate of future taxable income  the expected utilization of tax loss carryforwards  both domestic and foreign  and the expiration dates of tax loss carryforwards 
significant assumptions are used in developing the analysis of future taxable income for purposes 
table of contents of determining the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  in our opinion  are reasonable under the circumstances 
our consolidated effective income tax rate and related tax reserves are subject to uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations from numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated taxes in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  taxes are and could be due 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our reserves reflect the likely outcome of known tax contingencies 
the resolution of tax matters for an amount that is different than the amount reserved would be recognized in our effective income tax rate during the period in which such resolution occurs 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we elected to account for employee stock and option issuances under accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb through december  under apb  no compensation expense was recognized in the statements of income for stock granted to employees and non employee directors  if the exercise price at least equals the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r which is a revision of sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
in accordance with this revised standard  we plan to adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method for the transition 
in  we expect to recognize approximately million  pre tax  in additional expense based on option grants outstanding as of december  the impact of adoption of sfas r on future grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of sfas r and the company s adoption 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposures our earnings  as a result of our global operating and financing activities  are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
our current outlook assumes no significant changes in currency values from current rates 
should currency rates change sharply  our results could be negatively impacted 
we protect a portion of our currency exchange exposure with foreign currency forward contracts 
a sensitivity analysis indicates the potential loss in fair value on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  is approximately million 
such losses would be largely offset by gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying assets and liabilities that are being protected by the foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not apply hedge accounting to the foreign currency forward contracts used to offset currency related changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
these contracts are marked to market through earnings at the same time that the exposed assets and liabilities are remeasured through earnings 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
our senior credit facility and the series a bonds issued in connection with our new mexico facility are variable rate debt 
we currently do not expect our debt levels under the senior credit facility to have a materially different impact on our interest rate risk from that associated with our senior credit facility 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of such debt but do impact the amount of our interest payments and therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
on december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would cause an estimated reduction in income before income taxes for the next year of approximately million 
in january  the company paid premiums to purchase two three year interest rate caps for the purpose of protecting cash flows associated with interest payments on million of the existing variable rate debt outstanding  at any given time  against libor rates rising above 
under the terms of the interest rate caps  the company paid premiums to receive payments based on the difference between month libor and during any period in which the month libor rate exceeds 
the fair value of the interest rate caps was included in prepaid expenses and other current and the gains losses in fair value were charged to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair value and gains losses recognized on the interest rate caps are immaterial in all periods for which financial statements are presented 
the interest rate caps will expire on march  and the company has not yet determined if it will replace the interest rate caps upon expiration
