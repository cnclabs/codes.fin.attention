introduction the company manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products  operating in the united states and in other countries  with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world 
the company operates in two reportable business segments  food packaging and protective packaging 
the company s principal food packaging products are flexible materials  associated packaging equipment systems  rigid containers and absorbent pads 
these products  many of which bear the cryovac trademark  package a broad range of perishable foods 
the company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors  distributors  supermarket retailers and food service businesses 
the company s principal protective packaging products provide cushioning  surface protection and void fill 
the company primarily sells its protective packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries 
the company s global sales and marketing staff numbered approximately  employees in the countries in which it operates  who sell and market the company s products through a large number of distributors  fabricators and converters  as well as directly to end users such as food processors  food service businesses  and manufacturers 
the company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products 
in  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for or more of the company s consolidated net sales 
although net sales of both food packaging products and protective packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter  the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business or to either reportable business segment 
competition for most of the company s packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics  service and price 
competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and  as a result  the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 
the company s net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions  changes in the global economy  and the effects of foreign currency translation 
its costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemical related costs  which are not within the company s control 
consequently  the company s management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible 
the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors 
as is discussed below  the company s businesses are managed to generate substantial cash flow 
the company believes that its strong cash flow will permit it to continue to spend significantly on innovative research and development and to invest in its business by means of acquisitions and capital expenditures for property and equipment 
moreover  its ability to generate substantial cash flow should provide the company with the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises 
the company also believes that this cash flow  along with accumulated cash and funds available under its credit facilities  will enable the company to make the settlement payment  including interest  that is expected to be required of the company upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the w

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements the company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 
note  new accounting pronouncements recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  known as us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates  and while any differences may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company does not believe that the differences  taken as a whole  will be material 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements notes and accounts receivable in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria 
notes and accounts receivable  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  are net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
commitments and contingencies litigation on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery  it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 
the company expenses legal costs  including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency  as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
self insurance the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property  casualty  workers compensation and employee benefit claims 
the company accrues for outstanding reported claims  claims that have been incurred but not reported  and projected claims based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience  insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments  actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 
pensions the company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate 
for a limited number of its us employees and for some of its us employees  the company maintains defined benefit pension plans 
the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
under these accounting standards  the company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations  the expected future rate of return on plan assets  the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions 
in general  changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 
since only a limited number of employees are covered by these plans  such impact is not considered material to the company 
income taxes the company s deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carry forwards 
the company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  the company provides a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable earnings  with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carry forwards  to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes  the company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired 
based on this review  the company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices  which may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates from time to time  the company may use interest rate swaps  collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s interest rate swaps are described in note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
under the terms of the company s outstanding interest rate swap agreements in each year  the company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable rates that were based on six month london interbank offered rate  or libor 
as a result  under the terms of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements in each year  interest expense increased million  decreased million and decreased million for the years ended december   and  respectively  due to changes in six month libor 
at december  and  the company had no collars or options outstanding 
at december  and  the carrying value of the company s total debt  which includes the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps  was  million and  million  respectively 
the company s fixed rate debt at december  and  including the impact of interest rate swaps  was  million and  million  respectively 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total debt  including the impact of outstanding interest rate swaps  was  million at december  compared with  million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december  of million 
these changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt do not alter the company s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of such debt 
foreign exchange rates the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to fix the amount payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of these instruments are generally twelve months or less 
at december  and  the company had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair values of these contracts  which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates  was a net receivable at december  of million and zero at december  a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december  would have caused the company to pay approximately million to terminate these contracts 
the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time  such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing 
these instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency 
at december  and  the company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate and currency swap agreements outstanding 
the company s outstanding debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
the amount of outstanding debt denominated in a functional currency other than the us dollar was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match the currency of assets and liabilities 
commodities the company uses various commodity raw materials such as plastic resins and energy products such as electric power and natural gas in conjunction with its manufacturing processes 
generally  the company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
moreover  the company s supply chain team seeks to maintain appropriate levels of commodity raw material inventories thus minimizing the expense and risks of carrying excess inventories 
the company does not typically purchase substantial quantities in advance of production requirements 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components
