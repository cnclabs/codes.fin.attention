item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research  decision support tools and analysis across the health care industry 
best practices research identifies  analyzes and describes specific management initiatives  processes and strategies that have been determined to produce the best results in solving common business problems or challenges 
members of each program are typically charged a fixed annual fee and have access to an integrated set of services that may include best practices research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs  decision support tools and web based access to the program s content database 
our membership business model allows us to focus on a broad set of issues relevant to health care organizations  while promoting frequent use of our programs and services by our members 
this facilitates growth through cross sell opportunities to existing members and the development of new programs 
our revenues grew in fiscal over fiscal  and grew in fiscal over fiscal we also increased our contract value by at march  over march   and by at march  over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
our member renewal rate in each of the past five years has equaled or exceeded 
memberships in of our programs are renewable at the end of their membership contract term  which is typically one year 
our other best practices programs provide installation support 
these program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
renewable programs generated more than of our revenues in fiscal costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are generally expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  however  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
in fiscal  our income from operations was million  compared to million in fiscal our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation expenses 
cost of services represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services 
member relations and marketing expenses include the costs of acquiring new members and renewing existing members 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development and other administrative functions 
included in our operating costs for each year presented are equity related expenses representing additional payroll taxes for compensation expense as a result of the taxable income employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options 
depreciation expense includes the cost of depreciation of our property and equipment

total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the introduction and expansion of new programs and cross selling existing programs to existing members 
to a lesser degree  our revenue growth was also driven by sales to new member organizations and price increases 
we offered membership programs as of march   as of march  and as of march  our contract value increased from million at march  to million at march   and increased to million at march  our average contract value per member increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  and increased to  for fiscal we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
cost of services 
cost of services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increase in cost of services is primarily due to increased staffing and other costs associated with the delivery of program content and tools to our expanded membership base and due to the introduction of new programs 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services remained constant at for fiscal and fiscal cost of services increased to for fiscal the increase can be attributable to an increased investment in web based tools and applications used in certain of our newer best practice research programs which require more upfront resources before launch  and to variable licensing fees associated with one of our research programs 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from year to year  therefore the cost of services as a percentage of revenues in the periods presented may not be indicative of future results 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in member relations and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in sales staff and related costs associated with the introduction of new programs  as well as an increase in member relations personnel and related costs to serve the expanding membership base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase can be attributed to the development of new programs and the expansion of several administrative functions to support overall organizational growth 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  due to the decrease in additional payroll taxes for compensation expense paid as a result of the taxable income employees recognized upon the exercise of common stock options in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall decrease as a percent of revenues in fiscal and fiscal reflects the leveraging of resources across our larger revenue base 
general and administrative expense includes approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  of net charges from atlantic media company formerly dgb enterprises  inc  an entity created in by our founder to manage his various business interests including his ownership in us for expenses related to management services  shared space and facilities and certain administrative functions 
we believe these charges approximate the expense which would have been incurred had we provided the equivalent services internally 
these arrangements ended during fiscal see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of our arrangements with atlantic media company 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased from million or of revenues in fiscal  to million  or of revenues in fiscal  and decreased to million or of revenues in fiscal during fiscal we completed the build out of our new headquarters facility and incurred a loss on the disposal of certain office equipment 
in fiscal  under the terms of our lease agreement  we will incur additional construction costs in connection with the expansion of our headquarters facility and depreciation expense may increase in future periods as a result 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the growth was principally from income associated with the increased levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased as a result of cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from financing activities as further discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million in fiscal year  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in fiscal and was and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal includes the one time noncash income tax charge to earnings associated with our newly effective status as a qualified high technology company qhtc described below 
in february  we received notification from the office of tax and revenue of the district of columbia that we had been certified  effective january   as a qualified high technology company under the new e conomy transformation act of  as amended 
this certification had the effect of reducing our washington  dc statutory income tax rate to through calendar year  and thereafter  compared to per year without the qualification 
as a result  we recorded a one time noncash charge to write down our washington  dc net operating loss carry forward deferred tax asset by million  net of estimated tax credits for which we are eligible due to our qhtc status 
excluding the one time noncash charge our income tax rate for fiscal was 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
program membership fees are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
the combination of revenue growth and advance payment of memberships typically results in operating activities generating net positive cash flows on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  we expect that these funds and expected net positive cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements  as well as financing activities for at least the next months 
cash flows from investing activities 
we used net cash flows in investing activities in fiscal of million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of million  and purchases of property and equipment of million  which includes approximately million of expenditures relating to our new headquarters facility discussed below  offset by million in proceeds on the redemption of marketable securities 
we used net cash flows in investing activities in fiscal of million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million primarily related to the build out of our new headquarters facility  offset by million in proceeds on the redemption of marketable securities 
we used net cash flows in investing activities in fiscal of million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  capitalized software development costs of million  and million paid for the acquisition of optilink  offset by million in proceeds on the redemption of marketable securities 
in fiscal  we will incur additional capital expenditures related to our build out of an expansion floor available in our headquarters facility and increased investment in internal and external development resources to build web based tools for some of our new program launches 
cash flows from financing activities 
we generated million in cash from financing activities in fiscal we used net cash flows in financing activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options in conjunction with sales of our common stock by our employees 
also in fiscal  and  we received approximately million  million and million  respectively  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we repurchased   and  shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in january  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to million of our common stock  and our board of directors increased this amount by million in october and by an additional million in february our headquarters are located in approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc 
the facilities accommodate research  delivery  marketing and sales  information technology  administration  graphic services and operations personnel 
we lease our office facilities  and the lease expires in june the terms of the lease contain provisions for rental escalation and we are required to pay our portion of executory costs such as taxes and insurance 
we are also obligated to take additional expansion space in the building pursuant to the lease 
we also lease a small office in portland  oregon 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that additional facilities are available for lease to meet any future needs 
we entered into a million letter of credit agreement with a commercial bank which expires october   to provide a security deposit for our new office lease 
we pledged certain assets as collateral under the letter of credit agreement 
no amounts were drawn on this agreement 
the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these obligations are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period in thousands total yrs non cancelable operating leases off balance sheet arrangements at march   we have no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
share repurchase in january  we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the authorized amount was increased by our board to million in october  and was increased again to million in february repurchases will be made from time to time in open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions 
no minimum number of shares has been fixed 
we will fund our share repurchases with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
exercise of stock options options granted to certain of our option holders under our and stock based incentive compensation plans were exercised to acquire shares sold in public offerings at various times in fiscal  and upon the exercise of these options we received a total of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  in cash in payment of option exercise prices 
we recognized approximately million  million and  in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also incurred additional compensation deductions for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased the deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions that will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
in connection with these transactions  our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes did not change  our actual cash payments will be reduced as the deferred tax asset is utilized 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition revenues from renewable research memberships and best practices installation support memberships are recognized over the term of the related subscription agreement  which is generally months 
fees are generally billable when a letter agreement is signed by the member  and program agreement fees receivable and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the agreement or collection of fees  if earlier 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members whose membership agreements are subject to a service guarantee may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of the service period 
as of march   and  approximately million  and million  respectively  of deferred revenues were to be recognized beyond the following months 
one of our best practice research programs includes software tools together with implementation services  technical support and related membership services 
revenue for these arrangements is recorded pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the software and performance of the services has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we separate the fair value of the technical support and related membership services from the total value of the contract based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fees related to the software license and implementation services are bundled and recognized as the implementation services are performed 
fees associated with the technical support and related membership services are recorded as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  beginning when all other elements have been delivered 
allowance for uncollectible revenue we record an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing assessment of our members credit and the aging of receivables 
as part of our assessment  we examine our collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific customer collection issues that we have identified  general market conditions and current economic trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisition of optilink resulted in goodwill recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill amounts are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment at least annually 
other intangible assets consist of the costs of developing software for external use  and other acquired intangibles 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives using the straight line method 
recovery of long lived assets long lived assets and identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed 
impairment is identified by comparing the carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual dispositions 
impairment is measured and recorded on the basis of fair value 
fair value is generally determined using estimates of discounted cash flows 
expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information are considered in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
we believe that no such impairment existed as of march  and deferred incentives and other charges direct incentive compensation related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships and other direct and incremental costs are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability we have deferred income taxes consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards for regular federal and state income tax purposes generated from the exercise of common stock options 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
however  sfas no 
does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax laws and rates  including the estimated effects of the qhtc status on our washington  dc deferred tax assets 
we will recognize an adjustment to income for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of statement no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement no 
however  sfas no 
r generally requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective method compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date of adoption a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date of adoption and b based on the requirements of statement no 
r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of adoption that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed under the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
on april   the securities and exchange commission announced that the sfas no 
r effective transition date will be extended to annual periods beginning after june  the company will adopt this new standard  as required  on april  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r also mandates that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as permitted under current accounting rules 
this requirement may therefore reduce amounts reported from operating activities and increase the amounts from financing activities in periods after adoption 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r on the company s financial statements depend on numerous factors including the amounts and types of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model the company uses to value future share based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates 
as of march   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock based compensation arrangements 
of this amount  approximately million is expected to be recognized in the year ended march  these amounts exclude any compensation expense associated with restricted stock units  the issuance of shares purchased at a discount pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  or any new grants of share based payments 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company has accounted for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method through the year ended march  as a consequence  the company has recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under the company s employee stock purchase plan through the year ended march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
at march   our marketable securities consist of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government agency securities 
the average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material
