cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were  in  compared to  in the previous year 
the decrease is due primarily to decreased earnings  which were impacted by restructuring costs of  and lower accounts payable levels  partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses related to warranty  legal  freight and other accruals 
cash flows used for investing activities were  in  compared to  in the decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to lower acquisition costs compared to when the company acquired domus  which was a material acquisition 
in addition  purchases of property and equipment activity in was lower compared to the prior year as the company invested more in on implementing erp systems in north america  europe and asia pacific 
cash flows provided by financing activities in were  compared to cash flows provided of  in cash borrowed for financing activities in was much lower than in as the company borrowed less for acquisitions 
in addition to acquisition activities  the effect of foreign currency translation results in amounts being shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows that are different from the changes reflected in the respective balance sheet captions

free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure that is comprised of net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
management believes that this financial measure provides meaningful information for evaluating the overall financial performance of the company and its ability to repay debt or make future investments including acquisitions  etc the non gaap financial measure is reconciled to the gaap measure as follows in thousands twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   adjusted for purchases of property and equipment net   free cash flow   i contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations senior notes     revolving credit agreements     other notes   operating lease obligations      capital lease obligations      purchase obligations primarily computer systems   contracts other long term obligations product liability      serp     other  principally deferred compensation   total      dividend policy it is the company s policy to pay a nominal dividend in order for its stock to be more attractive to a broader range of investors

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in the report include accounts of the company  all majority owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the company is the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition invacare s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as updated by sab no 
 provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with gaap and sab no 
sales are only made to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis  which may include obtaining a credit application  a signed security agreement  personal guarantee and or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer 
credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and or other relevant financial information 
existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts 
the company offers discounts and rebates  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
discounts offered include cash discounts for prompt payment  base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers 
volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes 
product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale 
the company does not sell any goods on consignment 
i distributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections  delivery and returns 
product sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with dll  a third party financing company  to provide the majority of future lease financing to invacare customers 
as such  interest income is recognized based on the terms of the installment agreements 
installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments  interest income is no longer recognized 
all installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology  regardless of duration of the installment agreements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care  medical equipment dealers and long term care facilities located throughout the united states  australia  canada  new zealand and europe 
a significant portion of products sold to dealers  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
in addition  the company has seen a significant shift in reimbursement to customers from managed care entities 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on dealer liquidity and profitability 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  as a result of the third party financing arrangement with dll  management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company s limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined for manufacturing inventories by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products  redesigning of existing products  new product introductions  market changes and safety issues 
both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet 
in general  we review inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions 
depending on the situation  the individual item may be partially or fully reserved for 
no inventory that was reserved for has been sold at prices above their new cost basis 
the company continued to increase its overseas sourcing efforts  increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products  and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market 
these initiatives are sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  equipment  intangibles and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
furthermore  goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company completed the required initial analysis of goodwill as of january  as well as the annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each subsequent year  including the results of these analyses indicated no impairment of goodwill 
interest rates have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in our annual impairment testing 
increasing interest rates decrease the fair value estimates used in our testing 
product liability the company s captive insurance company  invatection insurance co  currently has a policy year that runs from september to august and insures annual policy losses of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate of the company s north american product liability exposure 
the company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage insuring up to  in annual aggregate losses arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company s per country foreign liability limits as applicable 
there can be no assurance that invacare s current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates 
i product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from a third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon third party actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards or settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices 
warranty generally  the company s products are covered from the date of sale to the customer by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product 
certain components carry a lifetime warranty 
a provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience 
the company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed 
historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company s warranty reserves 
claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed 
however  the company does consider other events  such as a product recall  which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision 
no material adjustments to warranty reserves were necessary in the current year 
see warranty costs in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual 
accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for options under its stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method proscribed in accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  thus  no compensation cost has been reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings for these options 
in addition  restricted stock awards have been granted without cost to the recipients and are being expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting periods 
if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for all stock options granted  net earnings per share assuming dilution would have been reduced by in  in and in the pro forma earnings per share assuming dilution amount of in is due primarily to the acceleration of vesting of underwater options below fair market value of approved by the board of directors on december  see shareholders equity transactions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
effective january   the company adopted fas r 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions 
the process requires estimating the company s current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies 
the temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
the company also must estimate the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and whether or not valuation allowances should be established 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies 
accounting changes in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its method of accounting for domestic manufactured inventories from the lower of cost  as determined by the last in  last out lifo method of accounting  or market to the lower of cost  as determined by the first in  first out fifo method of accounting  or market 
the company believes that this change is preferable because the change conforms to a single method of accounting for all of the company s inventories  lifo inventory values have not been materially different than fifo inventory values  and the majority of the company s competitors use fifo 
the change from lifo to fifo did not result in any change to the company s reported consolidated balance sheets because the inventory valued under lifo was at current cost 
as a result  there is no impact for the change from lifo to fifo on the company s consolidated statement of earnings and consolidated statement of shareholders equity for all periods presented 
i recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas r  which requires companies to expense stock options and other share based payments 
sfas r supersedes sfas no 
 which permitted either expensing stock options or providing pro forma disclosure 
in april  the sec announced that the adoption of sfas r would be delayed 
the provisions of sfas r  which are effective for the company on january   apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after january  as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
the company adopted the standard as of january  and estimates that the impact to the company s reported results in will be approximately per diluted share  which is less than the pro forma results shown in the company s note regarding accounting for stock based compensation in the notes to its consolidated financial statements included in this report due primarily to the acceleration of vesting approved by the board of directors on december  the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of the company s stock options primarily to partially offset the recent reductions in other benefits made by the company and to provide additional incentive to those critical to the company s current cost reduction efforts 
see shareholders equity transactions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments  including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments 
the company uses interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
based on december  debt levels  a change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately  additionally  the company operates internationally and  as a result  is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
specifically  the exposure results from intercompany loans and third party sales or payments 
in an attempt to reduce this exposure  foreign currency forward contracts are utilized 
the company does not believe that any potential loss related to these financial instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
