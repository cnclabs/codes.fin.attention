table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of the company 
the following are included in our md a overview of our business and industry  critical accounting policies  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
overview of our business and industry business  principal products  and locations we are a leading provider of human capital management software and solutions  which are designed to help enterprises of all sizes increase organizational performance  understand and maximize the value of their people and manage people related risks risks that include the aging workforce  the generational shift in the workforce and the increasingly competitive labor market and associated employee and executive turnover 
with intense competition for talent and the need to adapt quickly to changing markets  managing the workforce well is critical to an organization s ability to create sustainable competitive advantage 
our solutions help our customers through the implementation of a management system for aligning goals  developing and motivating people and measuring results 
by implementing our solutions  organizations are better equipped to align their workforce around the organization s business objectives  effectively manage growing regulatory requirements  increase sales and channel readiness  accelerate the productivity of new people joining the extended enterprise of employees  customers  partners  and suppliers  increase both the speed of customer acquisition and long term customer loyalty  shorten time to market of new products  and improve visibility into organizational performance 
on may   we completed the acquisition of thinq learning solutions  inc thinq  a provider of enterprise learning management solutions which allowed us to expand our customer base and provided greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation and increase stockholder value 
on january   we completed the acquisition of centra software  inc centra  a provider of online learning and training software and services 
we believe our acquisition of centra continues to strengthen our competitive position in the human capital management market and allows us to broaden and deepen our product offerings 
in addition  as a result of the acquisition our customer base is substantially larger and we have enhanced our global reach and resources  allowing us to better serve our customers 
the centra acquisition included total purchase consideration of million 
we have included the results of operations of centra in our consolidated financial statements beginning february  in connection with the acquisition of centra  we allocated  of the purchase price to in process research and development  or ipr d  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
we have expensed this amount in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may  software licenses we license our software solutions in multi element arrangements that include a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses 
to date  a substantial majority of our software license revenue has been derived from the saba learning product suite 
going forward  we expect the centra product lines and our saba 
table of contents performance product to generate a larger percentage of our license sales 
our license revenue is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  typically six to twelve months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 
ondemand ondemand revenue includes revenue derived from subscription based managed application services 
these services are generally provided pursuant to annual agreements and the associated revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
with the acquisition of centra  we believe that this line of revenue will become a larger percentage of our total revenue 
licenses updates and product support license updates and product support includes the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support 
we typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  license updates and product support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
our license updates and product support revenue depends upon both our sales of additional software licenses and annual renewals of existing license updates and product support agreements 
we expect license updates and product support revenue to increase due to our expanded customer base resulting from the centra acquisition 
at the date of the centra acquisition  we recorded fair value adjustments totaling million  to reduce centra s license updates and product support obligations to the estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
as former centra customers renew these license updates and product support contracts  we will recognize the full value of the license updates and product support contracts as deferred revenues and recognize the related revenue ratably over the contract period 
we believe that license updates and product support revenue will continue to grow as we anticipate that a substantial majority of our customers  as well as former centra customers  will renew their annual contracts and the sale of new software licenses will increase the number of customers that purchase license updates and product support 
professional services our professional services business consists of consulting  education and learning services 
consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that license software directly from us 
these consulting and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after licensing the software 
generally  consulting services related to software implementation are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of license revenue generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our customers generally engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update 
although we provide consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
learning services are less dependent than consulting and education services on the sale of our licenses 
learning services present additional opportunities that arise at different times throughout a customer life cycle 
locations our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
we have an international presence in india  france  japan  germany  the united kingdom  canada and australia through which we conduct various 
table of contents operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  other than india  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
significant trends and developments in our business since we commenced operations in and continuing throughout fiscal  our business grew rapidly 
during fiscal and continuing through the first three quarters of fiscal  our revenues declined as a result of a deterioration in the overall economy and information technology industry 
beginning in the later part of fiscal  many key indicators began to demonstrate signs of an economic recovery 
consistent with these indicators  our business began to improve during the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal and despite these recent improvements in macro economic trends  we believe many of our customers have not resumed previous levels of expenditures on information technologies  particularly enterprise software 
we attribute this continued level of depressed spending on enterprise software to customers concerns regarding the sustainability of the current economic recovery and the current geopolitical environment 
in order to achieve profitability  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue and continue to manage our expenses 
our ability to generate higher revenues and achieve profitability depends on many factors  including the demand for our products and services  the level of product and price competition  market acceptance of our new products  general economic conditions and the successful integration of centra 
in this regard  we continue to invest in areas that we believe can accelerate revenue growth and to manage expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions 
during fiscal and as a result of our acquisitions of centra and thinq  we implemented restructuring programs to consolidate excess facilities 
during fiscal  in response to the global economic slowdown  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions and included the consolidation of excess facilities 
there were no restructuring programs implemented in fiscal although we do not have any current plans to implement additional restructuring programs  business conditions may require us to reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce or consolidate excess facilities in the future 
we experience seasonality during our first fiscal quarter as sales are typically lower than sales in the immediately preceding fourth fiscal quarter 
our first fiscal quarter occurs during the summer months when general business activities slow down in a number of territories where we conduct our operations  particularly europe 
our commission structure and other sales incentives also tend to result in fewer sales in the first fiscal quarter than in the fourth fiscal quarter 
we anticipate that the negative impact of seasonality on our first quarter will continue 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas 
table of contents that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  as amended  we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
sop  as amended  requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we have analyzed each element in our multiple element arrangements and determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to certain ondemand offerings  license updates and product support and professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and we do not recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of sop are satisfied 
license revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
license updates and product support revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically months 
revenue related to professional services is generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we provide professional services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services is provided on a fixed fee basis 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized over the service delivery period using the percentage of completion method 
we use labor hours incurred as a percentage of total expected hours as the measure of progress towards completion 
revenue from our ondemand offerings is recognized as a service arrangement whereby the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
certain of our ondemand offerings are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access our software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of our software  in which case revenue is recognized under the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
our ondemand offerings also include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software 
when these ondemand offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and totaled million as of may  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  as of may   is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
effective june   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as such  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of may  in addition  we evaluated our purchased intangible assets and determined that all such assets have determinable lives 
total amortization of goodwill prior to june  was million 
our remaining goodwill balance at may  was million  including million and million recorded as a result of our acquisitions of centra and thinq  respectively 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal as of may   our purchased intangible assets balance was million 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
any reduction of enterprise fair value below the recorded amount of stockholders equity could require us to write down the value of and record an expense for an impairment loss 
restructuring costs 
the total accrued restructuring balance as of may  was million  which was comprised of million for facilities related charges and  for workforce reduction charges  of which million was recorded as part of purchase accounting 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas where we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to factors such as changes in property occupancy rates and rental prices charged for comparable properties 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined and may be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs or a decrease of the purchase price 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations in the period this was determined

we recorded income tax expense of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal income tax expense has consisted entirely of foreign income tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits 
the tax returns of one of the company s subsidiaries are currently under examination 
the company has concluded that it is probable that the examination will result in an additional liability 
we believe that adequate tax provisions have been provided for the likely outcome of the ongoing examination 
we will continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  including potential assessments of additional taxes  penalties 
table of contents and or interest  and revise our estimates  if deemed necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our income tax provision and net income 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets  as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth condensed consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  this information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that  in the opinion of management  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we have incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year or any other period

table of contents our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenues fall below our expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall and operating losses will increase 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience long sales cycles 
therefore  the timing of future customer contracts could be difficult to predict  making it difficult to estimate revenues between quarters 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes  both domestic and foreign  on employee exercises of non qualified stock options 
these taxes are recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees  measured by the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
we receive domestic tax deductions for gains realized by domestic employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital when realized 
our taxes and cash flows could vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the number of non qualified stock options exercised by employees in any quarter and  consequently  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described under the caption item a risk factors and below dependence of our revenues on a small number of large orders and the average order value  our ability to attract new customers  any changes in revenue recognition rules and interpretations of these rules  our ability to license additional products to current customers  the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our competitors  variability in the mix of our products and professional services revenues and the mix of new orders for our license and ondemand revenues in any quarter  technical difficulties or service interruptions of our computer network systems or the internet generally  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our business  foreign currency fluctuations  and acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   our principal source of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million 
at may   our bank facility covenants required us to maintain cash  net of the outstanding term debt  of million on a monthly basis 
years ended may  cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash provided by used in operating activities our most significant source of operating cash flows stems from customer purchases of our license  license updates and product support  ondemand and professional services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel and facilities related expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities was  
table of contents in fiscal compared to cash used of million in fiscal the increase is primarily a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities providing million and non cash charges of million offset by a higher net loss of million for the year 
the primary sources of the increase in fiscal were increases in deferred revenues of million and accounts receivables of million as a result of increased billings in fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the addition of centra and an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by decreases in accrued expenses and accrued compensation and related expenses of million in fiscal non cash expenses  such as amortization of intangibles  write off of in process research and development and depreciation  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing a increase

as of may   we had million outstanding under the term loan  no outstanding borrowings under the receivables borrowing base revolving credit line and were in compliance with all of the covenants related to this credit facility 
at may   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
of this amount  approximately million was invested in money market accounts bearing variable interest rates of between and 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents is held in non interest bearing accounts at several banks 
variable interest rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
a change in interest rates would not be significant 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are primarily made in us dollars  and to a lesser but increasing extent  british pounds and euros  however  as we continue to expand our operations  more of our contracts may be denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and japanese yen 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 

table of contents our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises in part from inter company accounts with our foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary  and  when re measured and translated in us dollars  have an impact on our operating results depending upon the movement in foreign currency rates 
during fiscal  our total realized and unrealized losses due to movements in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds and australian dollars  was  as exchange rates vary  these foreign exchange results may vary and adversely or favorably impact operating results 
an unfavorable change of in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements
