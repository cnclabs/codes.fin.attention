item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the corporation s management of interest rate risk 
the corporation is subject to lending risk there are inherent risks associated with the corporation s lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets 
table of contents where the corporation operates as well as those across the state of texas and the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
the corporation is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the corporation to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the corporation 
as of december   approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans 
these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
because the corporation s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned loans in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient the corporation maintains an allowance for possible loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense  that represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the corporation s control  may require an increase in the allowance for possible loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses  the corporation will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for possible loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned allowance for possible loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the corporation s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
the corporation is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of the corporation s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  the corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the corporation may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the corporation s ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the corporation s exposure to environmental liability 
although the corporation 
table of contents has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas the corporation s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which the corporation operates 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  the corporation provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the texas metropolitan areas of austin  boerne  corpus christi  dallas  fort worth  galveston  harlingen  houston  mcallen  new braunfels  san antonio and san marcos 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the corporation s products and services as well as the ability of the corporation s customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the corporation s deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation operates in a highly competitive industry and market area the corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets the corporation operates 
additionally  various out of state banks have begun to enter or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which the corporation currently operates 
the corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of the corporation s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the corporation can 
the corporation s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand the corporation s market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which the corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors 
customer satisfaction with the corporation s level of service 
industry and general economic trends 

table of contents failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the corporation s competitive position  which could adversely affect the corporation s growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision the corporation  primarily through cullen frost  frost bank and certain non bank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect the corporation s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the corporation to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products the corporation may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
