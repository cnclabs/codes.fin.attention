item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
executive overview our businesses are organized into three segments small business services  financial services and direct checks 
our small business services segment generated of our consolidated revenue 
this segment sells checks  forms and related products to more than six million small businesses and home offices through direct response marketing  financial institution referrals  independent distributors  sales representatives and the internet 
small business services is comprised of new england business service  inc nebs  which we acquired in june  and our former business services segment 
our financial services segment generated of our consolidated revenue 
this segment sells personal and business checks and related products and services to approximately  financial institution clients nationwide  including banks  credit unions and financial services companies 
our direct checks segment generated of our consolidated revenue 
this segment is the nation s leading direct to consumer check supplier  selling under the checks unlimited and designer checks brands via direct response marketing and the internet 
all three of our segments operate primarily in the united states 
small business services also has operations in canada 
our results of operations for were negatively impacted by lower volume in our financial services and direct checks segments caused by financial institution client losses  consolidations among financial institutions  the continuing decline in check usage and lower direct mail consumer response rates 
continuing pricing pressure in our financial services segment also had a negative impact 
partially offsetting these negative trends was the full year impact of the nebs acquisition and the resulting synergies 
additionally  we realized the benefit of several cost reduction initiatives undertaken in response to declining revenue in financial services and direct checks 
as we begin  our focus is shifting from integrating nebs to executing strategies we believe will drive sustained growth in small business services 
the foundation of these strategies is the interdependency between our small business services and financial services segments 
the relationships we have with financial institutions help generate small business referrals  which we serve through our small business services segment 
we believe small business services provides one of the most comprehensive product offerings for small businesses 
this allows us to meet the needs of small businesses  which in turn  strengthens our ability to retain and acquire clients in our financial services segment as we enable them to better serve small business customers 
examples of steps we have already taken toward executing our strategies include the following launching our new deluxe business advantage sm program  which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses 
our inside sales team is combined with our direct sales force  which makes one on one contact with small businesses and financial institution branches more effective 
this model is designed to align our resources in the most productive and cost effective manner 
we will continue to roll this program out in which will require additional investment  especially in early  as we expand our sales force 
we believe these investments  which are primarily in personnel  will begin to yield benefits immediately and will deliver positive returns in the second half of focusing our sales team on expanding sales to new and existing customers 
in addition to increasing order sizes  we are also focused on providing products to our customers that they currently purchase from other suppliers 
for example  we are providing incentives to our sales team when they sell new products to existing customers and we have implemented enhancements to the scripts used by our sales associates when interacting with customers 
with the breadth of our products  we can meet many of the needs of small businesses  thereby simplifying their purchasing process and increasing our revenue 
designing and piloting a tiered model for segmenting small business customers 
this tiered model allows us to direct our marketing approach based on how often a customer orders  the dollar value of an average order  which order channel the customer prefers and their loyalty to our brand or brands 
two of our largest product groups  checks and business forms  are mature products and their use has been declining 
according to our estimates  the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines and electronic payment systems 
a federal reserve study reported that the check is still the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  accounting for approximately of all non cash payments processed in  down from when checks comprised approximately of all non cash payments 
the federal reserve study also indicated that consumer checks are declining faster than business checks 
in addition  continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  electronic transaction systems and off the shelf business software applications have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by business forms products 
because check usage is declining and financial institutions are consolidating  we also have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through supply contracts averaging three to five years in duration 
as we compete to retain and obtain financial institution business in the face of declining volume  the resulting pricing pressure has reduced our profit margins  and we expect this trend to continue 
we acquired several new financial institution clients in  including three major financial institutions  and we have renewed our relationship with another major client 
we expect to see the full impact of these new clients in the second quarter of at the same time  mid client losses from financial institution consolidations will have a negative impact on revenue in comparison to  especially in the early portions of during  we expect our share of the financial institution channel to increase 
our direct checks segment and portions of our small business services segment have been impacted by reduced customer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
the dma response rate report published by the direct marketing association and our own experience indicate that direct to consumer media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services 
additionally  we believe that the decline in our customer response rates is attributable to the decline in check usage  the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and an increase in financial institutions providing free checks to consumers 
moreover  with over million customers who have purchased from our direct checks segment since its inception  fewer consumers are eligible for the lower introductory prices we offer first time customers 
we continue to focus on cost management and operational excellence 
as previously announced  we intend to close two printing facilities by mid the application of lean principles in our manufacturing area continues to result in increased efficiencies  and we are applying these principles throughout the rest of the company 
during  we plan to complete our installation of a new order capture system in portions of our order processing and call center operations 
this new system is expected to lower our information technology infrastructure costs by reducing redundancy while standardizing systems and processes 
after considering the factors previously discussed  we expect that earnings will decrease from we estimate that diluted earnings per share will be between and for  versus for  which reflects the following key differentiators from revenue and operating income will continue to decline in financial services and direct checks due to financial institution client losses in mid  as well as lower check usage  continued pricing pressure in financial services and lower direct marketing response rates in direct checks 
however  we expect our share of the financial institution channel to grow in as we bring on recent client wins 
additional investments to execute our small business services strategy and roll out our new order capture system are expected to negatively impact earnings in the first half of the year  but should deliver positive returns beginning in the third quarter 
we expect small business services to deliver mid single digit revenue growth with additional growth in operating income based upon results from our launch of deluxe business advantage and other key initiatives 
we anticipate that operating cash flow will be between million and million in  compared to million in the increase in will be due primarily to anticipated decreases in contract acquisition payments to financial institution clients as fewer large clients are up for renewal in and we are seeking to reduce our use of up front product discounts 
additionally  payments for performance based employee compensation will be lower in based on our operating performance and we anticipate other positive working capital changes 
in addition  we expect capital spending to be approximately million in consolidated results of operations consolidated revenue percent change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except per order amounts revenue    orders    revenue per order as nebs was acquired in june  the full year impact of nebs operations contributed an increase in revenue of million in the million decrease in revenue for our other businesses compared to was primarily due to a decline in volume for our financial services and direct checks segments 
the loss of a large financial institution client in late was the largest single contributor to the volume decline 
in addition  the volume decrease was due to the overall decline in check usage  mid client losses due to financial institution consolidations and the following factors specific to our direct checks segment lower direct mail consumer response rates  lower customer retention and an increase in financial institutions offering free checks to consumers 
on a total company basis  financial institution free check programs result in either the sale of a lower priced product or a lost sale  depending on whether the financial institution is a client of our financial services segment 
revenue was also negatively affected by continued pricing pressure in our financial services segment 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue per order for our direct checks segment due to a shift from the mail order channel to the internet and phone order channels  which typically result in higher revenue per order and a higher percentage of reorders 
additionally  direct checks reorders  which generate higher revenue per order  have become a larger percentage of total orders  and we benefited from price increases in our small business services segment 
contract termination payments did not have a significant impact on our revenue  as compared to  as the amount of these payments was comparable each year 
the number of orders decreased in  as compared to  despite the full year impact of the nebs acquisition 
the volume decreases at financial services and direct checks exceeded the positive impact of the nebs acquisition 
revenue per order increased in  as compared to  as small business services orders increased as a percentage of total orders and direct checks revenue per order increased as discussed earlier 
the acquisition of nebs contributed revenue of million in the million decrease in revenue for our other businesses compared to was due to a decline in volume resulting from the decline in check usage and the following factors specific to our direct checks segment lower direct mail consumer response rates  longer reorder cycles due to promotional strategies for multi box orders and lower customer retention 
these volume decreases were partially offset by increased financial institution referrals for our small business services segment 
partially offsetting the volume decline was an increase in revenue per order as compared to due to continued strength in selling premium priced licensed and specialty check designs  price increases in our direct checks and small business services segments and a million contract termination payment from a former financial institution client in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by increased competitive pricing pressure within our financial services segment 
the number of orders decreased in  as compared to  despite the nebs acquisition in june  as volume decreases at financial services and direct checks offset the increase from the nebs acquisition 
revenue per order increased in  as compared to  primarily due to the increase in small business services orders as a percentage of total orders

gross margin decreased in  as compared to  due in large part to the full year impact of nebs operations 
nebs historical gross margins have been seven to eight points lower than our other businesses because of its non check product mix 
this resulted in a percentage point decrease in our consolidated gross margin in additionally  pricing pressure in our financial services segment continued to impact our gross margin 
offsetting these decreases was the increase in direct checks revenue per order discussed earlier  on going cost management efforts  including the closing of six printing facilities in  continued productivity improvements  as well as cost synergies resulting from the nebs acquisition and lower performance based employee compensation 
gross margin was flat in  as compared to higher revenue per order  as well as continued productivity improvements and on going cost management efforts  including the closing of six printing facilities in  were offset by the impact of the lower margin nebs business and the continued pricing pressure facing our financial services segment

in thousands selling  general and administrative expense   sg a as a percentage of revenue pt 
pt 
the increase in sg a expense in  as compared to  was primarily due to the full year impact of expenses of the acquired nebs business  an increase of million in acquisition related amortization expense and an increase of million in integration expenses 
partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease in performance based employee compensation  cost reductions in response to declining revenue  cost synergies resulting from the nebs acquisition and a million decrease in direct checks advertising expense primarily due to spending for new product initiatives in sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to the decline in revenue for financial services and direct checks being greater than the reduction in fixed sg a expense 
additionally  nebs results increased our sg a percentage by percentage points 
nebs has historically had a higher sg a percentage than our other businesses due to its greater reliance on direct mail and a direct sales force to acquire and retain customers  as well as its decentralization of sg a functions 
additionally  as previously discussed  these results included an increase of million in acquisition related amortization expense and an increase of million in integration expenses 
the increase in sg a expense in  as compared to  was primarily due to expenses of the acquired nebs business  including million of additional acquisition related amortization expense and million of integration expenses  a million increase in performance based employee compensation due to our operating performance exceeding planned amounts  a million increase in stock based compensation due to the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and a million increase in direct checks advertising expense due to new product efforts 
partially offsetting these increases were cost management efforts  including savings realized from employee reductions  lower discretionary spending and million of asset impairment losses in the asset impairment losses related to manufacturing technologies and software 
we had been intending to implement the manufacturing technologies during however  having already realized many efficiencies in our manufacturing function as a result of other initiatives  including the implementation of lean manufacturing  the incremental benefits expected from these technologies no longer warranted their implementation 
the impaired software was intended to replace several of our existing systems and bring various technologies used by the company onto one platform 
however  based on our continuing evaluation of investment initiatives  we determined that the costs to implement the system and the timeline for implementation did not result in an adequate return on our investment 
the majority of the impaired assets had no alternative use and could not be sold to third parties 
thus  these assets were written down to a carrying value of zero 
certain related hardware was sold to third parties and was written down to its fair value less costs to sell 
of the total asset impairment losses  million related to property  plant and equipment and million related to intangible assets 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of nebs historically higher sg a percentage

in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate pt 
pt 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was primarily due to the new federal qualified production activity deduction which was passed as part of the american jobs creation act of  as well as changes in our state tax rates due to changes in our legal entity structure 
these impacts were partially offset by lower tax credits in and the positive impact in of refunds received for prior year state income tax credits and an increase in our estimate of state income tax credits 
we expect our tax rate to be approximately 
the increase in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was primarily due to the reversal of million of previously established income tax reserves during a prior year federal audit period was closed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and we reached agreements with two states to favorably settle proposed income tax audit assessments 
as a result  the related reserves were no longer required 
these reversals lowered our effective tax rate by points 
our effective tax rate was positively impacted by refunds received for prior year state income tax credits  as well as an increase in our estimate of state income tax credits 
income from continuing operations percent change vs

in thousands income from continuing operations    the decrease in income from continuing operations in  as compared to  was primarily due to lower volume resulting from the continuing decline in check usage  mid client losses due to financial institution consolidations  lower direct mail response rates and customer retention for our direct checks segment  and the loss of a large financial institution client in late additionally  our results were negatively impacted by continued pricing pressure within our financial services segment  higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and the full year impact of financing the nebs acquisition  as well as the full year impact of amortization resulting from the nebs acquisition 
these decreases were partially offset by the full year contribution of the nebs business and the resulting cost synergies  lower performance based employee compensation  increased sales of premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and cost reductions in response to lower revenue  as well as manufacturing productivity improvements 
the increase in income from continuing operations in  as compared to  was due to the acquisition of nebs  manufacturing productivity improvements  other cost management efforts and higher net restructuring charges in further information regarding our restructuring charges can be found in the section entitled restructuring accruals 
these increases were partially offset by higher interest expense in due to financing the nebs acquisition  the positive impact in from the reversal of income tax reserves and higher stock based compensation expense in due to the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation

we disclose these measures because they can be used to analyze profitability between companies and industries by eliminating the effects of financing ie  interest and capital investments ie  depreciation and amortization 
we believe these measures can indicate whether a company s earnings are adequate to pay its debts without regard to financing  capital structure or income taxes 
we also believe that increases in these measures depict increased ability to attract financing and increase the valuation of our business 
we do not consider these measures to be substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap

restructuring accruals during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance primarily related to the closing of our financial services check printing facility located in dallas  texas and our direct checks check printing facility located in anniston  alabama  as well as reductions in various functional areas primarily within our direct checks and financial services segments 
the closure of the dallas facility was primarily due to the loss of a major financial institution client whose contract expired at the end of the other reductions were a result of the continuing decline in check usage  as well as increased productivity 
both the dallas and anniston facilities were closed during the fourth quarter of the other employee reductions were completed during in total  employees received a total of million in severance payments  which were funded by cash from operations 
these restructuring charges are reflected as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance primarily related to the closing of three of our financial services check printing facilities and other reductions in employees within financial services 
we were able to close the three check printing facilities because of the expertise we have developed in logistics  productivity and inventory management  as well as the decline in check usage 
the other employee reductions were the result of our ongoing cost management efforts 
all three check printing facilities were closed during  and the other employee reductions were also substantially completed during in total  employees received a total of million in severance payments  which were funded by cash from operations 
these restructuring charges are reflected as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
as a result of the five facility closings and other employee reductions discussed here  we estimate that we realized net cost savings in of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense  in comparison to our results of operations

the severance accruals also included amounts due to certain nebs executives under change of control provisions included in their employment agreements  as we eliminated redundancies between the two companies 
severance payments are expected to be substantially completed by the end of  utilizing cash from operations 
as a result of these facility closures and employee reductions  we estimate that we realized cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in  in comparison to nebs historical results of operations 
we estimate that we will realize additional savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in  in comparison to our results of operations

total debt to ebitda was times for and and times for the ratio was unchanged from as the decrease in total debt as of december  was offset by the decrease in ebitda resulting from our lower earnings in the increase in  as compared to  was due to the higher total debt level as of december  due to financing of the nebs acquisition 
the comparable ratio of total debt to net income was times for  times for and times for ebit to interest expense was times for  times for and times for our committed lines of credit contain covenants requiring a minimum ebit to interest expense ratio of times on a four quarter trailing basis 
a decrease in this ratio in  as compared to  was expected 
the decrease was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from higher interest rates  as well as higher debt levels to fund the acquisition of nebs in june the decrease in  as compared to  was primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher debt levels to fund the acquisition of nebs and to fund share repurchases earlier in the year 
we believe the risk of violating our financial covenants is low as we expect solid profitability and cash flow to continue 
the comparable ratio of net income to interest expense was times for  times for and times for free cash flow to total debt was for  for and for we calculate free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of capital assets and dividends paid to shareholders 
the decrease in  as compared to  was due to the decrease in operating cash flow discussed earlier 
the increase in  as compared to  was due to the increase in operating cash flow discussed earlier 
this impact was partially offset by our higher debt level as of december   due to financing required for the nebs acquisition 
the comparable ratio of net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations to total debt was for  for and for further information regarding our use of ebitda and ebit was provided earlier under consolidated results of operations 
free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap in the united states of america 
we monitor free cash flow on an ongoing basis  as it measures the amount of cash generated from our operating performance after investment initiatives and the payment of dividends 
it represents the amount of cash available for the payment of debt and for general corporate purposes and strategic initiatives 
we do not consider free cash flow to be a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
instead  we believe that free cash flow is a useful liquidity measure which should be considered in addition to those measures reported in accordance with gaap 
the measure of free cash flow to total debt is a liquidity measure which illustrates to what degree our free cash flow covers our existing debt 
free cash flow is derived from net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations as follows in thousands free cash flow    purchases of capital assets    cash dividends paid to shareholders    net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations capital resources our total debt was  million as of december   a decrease of million from december  our equity market capitalization was billion as of december   based on the closing stock price of and million basic shares outstanding  down from billion as of december  capital structure december  in thousands change commercial paper    current portion of long term debt    long term debt    total debt    shareholders deficit    total capital    we are in a shareholders deficit position due to the required accounting treatment for share repurchases 
we have not repurchased any shares since the second quarter of  and we expect our shareholders deficit to continue to decrease in future periods  absent additional share repurchase activity 
share repurchases during the past three years were as follows in thousands dollar amount   number of shares  debt structure december  in thousands amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate change fixed interest rate   floating interest rate    capital leases    total debt    further information concerning our outstanding debt can be found under the caption note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we may  from time to time  consider retiring our outstanding debt through cash purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges  if any  would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
during  we entered into million of forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge  or lock in  the interest rate on a portion of the debt we issued in the termination of the lock agreements in september yielded a deferred pre tax loss of million 
during  we entered into two forward rate lock agreements to effectively hedge  or lock in  the annual interest rate on a portion of the debt we issued in the termination of the lock agreements in december yielded a deferred pre tax loss of million 
these losses are reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and are being reclassified ratably to our statements of income as increases to interest expense over the terms of the related debt 
we currently have a million commercial paper program in place which is supported by two committed lines of credit 
the credit agreements governing the lines of credit contain customary covenants regarding the ratio of ebit to interest expense and levels of subsidiary indebtedness 
no amounts were drawn on these lines of credit during or during as of december   million was available under our committed lines of credit for borrowing or for support of additional commercial paper  as follows in thousands total available expiration date commitment fee five year line of credit  july 
five year line of credit  july 
total committed lines of credit  commercial paper outstanding  net available for borrowing as of december   our canadian subsidiary also has a million canadian dollars committed line of credit available for borrowing 
no amounts were drawn on this line of credit during  and no amounts were outstanding under this line as of december  in january  moody s investors service downgraded our long term debt rating to baa from baa and downgraded our short term debt rating to prime from prime additionally  they have placed a negative outlook on our debt 
moody s indicated that the downgrades resulted from increased business risk and deterioration in our revenue base due to volume declines and intensifying pricing pressure 
moody s also indicated that they recognize our plans to offset these pressures by growing our small business services segment  but they perceive execution risk in an unproven business model 
also in january  standard and poor s credit rating agency s p lowered our long term debt rating to bbb from bbb and our short term debt rating to a from a they also placed a negative outlook on our debt 
s p indicated that the downgrades reflect greater than expected declines in check pricing and volumes due to heightened competitive pressures 
s p also indicated that the ratings reflect our leading market position  good margins and adequate cash flow generation 
despite the downgrades in our credit ratings  we intend to issue commercial paper as long as the market is available to us 
to the extent the commercial paper market is not available or is not cost effective  we will utilize our million committed lines of credit or issue term debt  depending on which alternative is most economical 
our credit facilities do not have covenants or events of default tied to our credit ratings 
as the commitment fees for our lines of credit are tied to our credit ratings  these fees will increase in to for the million line and for the million line 
we believe our future operating cash flows and our available credit capacity are sufficient to support our operations  including capital expenditures  required debt service and dividend payments  for the foreseeable future 
other changes in financial condition other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment 
these costs are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
changes in contract acquisition costs during were as follows in thousands balance  december   cash payments  decrease in contract acquisition obligations  amortization  refunds from contract terminations  balance  december   the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or obtain clients 
in recent years  both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments has increased 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
the impact of these costs is the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made as opposed to providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution 
contract acquisition payments due within the next year are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals were million as of december  and million as of december  accruals for contract acquisition payments included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december  and million as of december  net assets of discontinued operations decreased million from december  primarily due to the sale of premiumwear  the apparel business we had acquired as part of the nebs acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any potential liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters 
further information can be found under the caption note other commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we are not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  or on our access to  or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we have not established any special purpose entities 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands total and thereafter long term debt and related interest      commercial paper   capital lease obligations and related interest     operating lease obligations     purchase obligations     other long term liabilities     total     purchase obligations include amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for information technology services related to network servers  personal computers  telecommunications  software development and support and help desk services 
additionally  purchase obligations include amounts due under direct checks direct mail advertising and royalty agreements 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here  as our business partners typically allow us to cancel these purchase orders as necessary to accommodate business needs 
certain of the contracts with third party service providers allow for early termination upon the payment of early termination fees 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would incur early termination fees of million as of december  other long term liabilities consist primarily of amounts due for contract acquisition costs  workers compensation and deferred compensation 
of the million reported as other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the payments shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts include the following a portion of the amount due under our deferred compensation plan under this plan  employees begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur 
environmental remediation costs during  we purchased an environmental insurance policy which covers pre existing conditions from third party claims and cost overruns for years at owned  leased and divested sites  as well as any new conditions discovered at currently owned or leased sites for ten years 
as a result  we expect to receive reimbursements from the insurance company for environmental remediation costs we incur 
the related receivables from the insurance company are reflected in other current assets and other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets based on the amounts of our environmental accruals 
items which will not be paid in cash  such as a deferred gain resulting from a sale leaseback transaction with an unaffiliated third party 
total contractual obligations do not include the following payments for our retiree health care plans benefits paid under our retiree health care plans are dependent on the level of medical costs incurred by plan participants 
additionally  we have contributed funds to a trust for the purpose of funding our retiree health care plan 
trust assets can be utilized only to pay medical costs of plan participants 
thus  we have the option of paying retiree medical costs from the trust or from the general assets of the company 
the unfunded benefit obligation for this plan was million as of december  payments to our defined contribution pension and k plans the amounts payable under our defined contribution pension and k plans are dependent on the number of employees providing services throughout the year  their wage rates and in the case of the k plans  whether employees elect to participate in the plans 
profit sharing payments amounts payable under our profit sharing plans are dependent on our operating performance 
contributions which may be made to the veba trust which we use to fund employee and retiree medical and severance payments 
payments to our canadian pension plan this plan is funded by a trust which we have established for this purpose 
trust assets can only be utilized to fund pension payments and have been invested 
if these investments do not perform as expected  we may be required to provide further funding to the trust 
however  we cannot predict when  or if  further funding will be required 
income tax payments which will be remitted on our earnings 
related party transactions we have not entered into any related party transactions during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we implemented one significant change to our accounting policies during on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this change in accounting principle is discussed in further detail under consolidated results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite lived trade names as of december   we had goodwill of million  comprised of million from the acquisition of nebs  million related to our direct checks segment and million related to our acquisition of dots pixels  inc  a canadian based digital printer  in the third quarter of goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate that goodwill is impaired 
as discussed earlier under segment results  our direct checks segment has been impacted by the decline in check usage  lower consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements  lower customer retention and an increase in financial institutions offering free checks to consumers 
to date  we have been able to offset to a large degree the impact of the resulting volume decline through improved selling techniques  price increases and cost management efforts 
we also have two indefinite lived trade names totaling million as of december   resulting from the acquisition of nebs 
we continually evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we subsequently determine that one or both of these assets has a finite useful life  we will first test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
indefinite lived trade names are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate that the asset is impaired 
the impairment analysis completed in found no indication of impairment  although the valuation determined that the fair values of the assets approximated their carrying values 
an impairment loss may be required if future valuations do not support the carrying values of these assets 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are timing differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves  as well as related interest 
our reserves for contingent tax liabilities totaled million as of december   and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that our current tax reserves are adequate  and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income in the future 
during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
a prior year federal audit period was closed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and we reached agreements with two states to favorably settle proposed income tax audit assessments 
as a result  the related reserves were no longer required 
restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
the acquisition of nebs resulted in even larger restructuring accruals as we combined the two companies and exited certain activities 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as many times employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from actual employee behavior  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
with regards to our employee reduction initiatives  we subsequently reversed million of the original restructuring accruals as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
no significant adjustments were made to the accruals related to the nebs acquisition or our employee reduction initiatives 
post retirement benefits detailed information regarding our post retirement benefit plans  including a description of the plans  their related future cash flows and plan assets  can be found under the caption note pension and other post retirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net post retirement benefit expense was million in  million in and million in our business segments record post retirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our post retirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize yield curve approaches to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
additionally  we consider moody s high quality corporate bond rates when selecting our discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
to determine the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  we use the rp combined healthy participant mortality table 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our post retirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods could be impacted 
in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual post retirement benefit expense by approximately million 
in measuring the net post retirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual post retirement benefit expense by approximately million 
in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be and our ultimate health care inflation rate for and beyond was assumed to be 
a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
unrecognized gains and losses are reflected in post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan  which is currently years 
because employees hired after december  are not eligible to participate in our retiree health care plan  the average remaining service life of employees expected to receive benefits will continue to decrease 
as such  the amortization of our unrecognized actuarial loss will continue to accelerate over the next several years 
amortization of the unrecognized actuarial loss will increase million in  as compared to as of december  and  our unrecognized net actuarial loss was million and million  respectively  and was comprised of the following in thousands discount rate assumption   health care cost trend   claims experience   return on plan assets   other   unrecognized net actuarial loss   during the fourth quarter of  we amended our retiree health care plan to limit the number of employees eligible for benefits under the plan 
in order to receive the current level of benefits  employees had to reach years of service and points total of age and years of service prior to january  employees reaching years of service and points between january  and december  are eligible for the current level of benefits  however  their premiums will not be reduced once they become eligible for medicare as is currently the case 
employees reaching years of service and points after december  must pay the full cost of coverage if they elect to participate in our health care plan 
as a result of this plan change  we recognized a curtailment gain of million during the fourth quarter of this gain is reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold of million and a reduction of sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
this plan change resulted in a million decrease in our post retirement benefit expense 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of this fsp allowed additional time for companies to determine how the new law affected a company s accounting for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted foreign earnings 
the new law provided for a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated and which met certain requirements 
during the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million dollars from our canadian operations in accordance with this law 
this resulted in tax expense of million in the fourth quarter of in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the new statement is referred to as sfas no 
r and is entitled share based payment 
the new statement requires companies to recognize expense for stock based compensation in the statement of income and is effective for us on january  we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
r to result in a significant change in the compensation expense we currently recognize in our statements of income under sfas no 
additionally  we expect that the cumulative effect of the accounting change related to the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an immaterial impact on our consolidated statement of income 
in conjunction with our adoption of sfas no 
r in  we will modify our method of recognizing compensation expense for stock option awards granted to individuals achieving qualified retiree status prior to completion of the option s normal vesting period 
currently  we recognize expense for such awards over their applicable vesting period  with cost recognition accelerated if and when an employee retires with qualified retiree status 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we will recognize the entire expense for these awards over the period from the date of grant until the date an employee is expected to achieve qualified retiree status under the terms of the applicable option agreement 
if we had applied this accounting methodology in previous years  it would have had no impact on diluted earnings per share for diluted earnings per share for would have decreased  and pro forma diluted earnings per share for would have increased 
in november  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp provides an alternative method for calculating the net excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies as required under sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating the transition options for accounting for the income tax consequences of share based payment awards and will determine which methodology we will adopt during under the fsp  we have one year after our adoption of sfas no 
r to make this decision 
we expect to have a positive income tax windfall pool upon the adoption of sfas no 
r

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during  we continued to utilize commercial paper to fund working capital requirements 
in addition  we have three committed lines of credit available 
the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following in thousands carrying amount fair value weighted average interest rate long term notes maturing october   long term notes maturing december   long term notes maturing october   commercial paper   long term notes maturing september   capital lease obligations maturing through september   total debt   based on quoted market rates as of december   except for our capital lease obligations which are shown at carrying value 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of million in  million for and million for we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in and loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
the effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and cash flows  as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
