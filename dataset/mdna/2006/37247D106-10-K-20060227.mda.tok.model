table of contents life insurance overview our life insurance business markets and sells term and universal life  insurance products that provide a personal financial safety net for individuals and their families 
these products provide protection against financial hardship after the death of an insured by providing cash payments to the beneficiaries of the policyholder 
some types of life insurance also offer a savings element that can be used to help accumulate funds to meet future financial needs 
according to the american council of life insurers  sales of new life insurance coverage in the us were trillion in  and total life insurance coverage in the us was trillion as of december  excluding variable life insurance sales  annualized first year premiums for life insurance increased by an average of per year from to  according to limra international 
our principal life insurance product is term life  which provides life insurance coverage with guaranteed level premiums for a specified period of time 
term life insurance has little or no buildup of cash value that is payable upon lapse of the coverage 
we have been a leading provider of term life insurance for more than two decades  and we believe that we are a leading provider of term life insurance through brokerage general agencies in the us in addition to term life insurance  we offer universal life insurance products  which are designed to provide protection for the entire life of the insured and may include a buildup of cash value that can be used to meet particular financial needs during the policyholder s lifetime 
our life insurance business also includes a run off block of whole life insurance 
during  sales of our term life insurance products and universal life insurance products increased and  respectively  from  largely due to price reductions for term life policies  new product introductions  distribution expansion and initiatives to enhance our service offerings 
in january  we leveraged our capital efficiency to reduce selected prices of our term life insurance 
we introduced new  competitively positioned products in both our term and universal life insurance product lines  adding in february what we believe is an attractively priced survivorship universal life product  lifetime provider sm sul  and entering the fast growing return of premium rop term life market in october with our vantagepoint sm product 
we also implemented several enhancements to our existing universal life product portfolio  demonstrating our strong commitment to this market 
we broadened our distribution  adding approximately new brokerage general agencies and new insurance marketing organizations with more than  producers during the year  while continuing to leverage our technology enhanced customer service platform 
we price our insurance policies based primarily upon our own historical experience in the risk categories that we target 
our pricing strategy is to target individuals in preferred risk categories and offer them attractive products at competitive prices 
preferred risks include healthier individuals who generally have family histories that do not present increased mortality risk 
we also have significant expertise in evaluating people with health problems and offer appropriately priced coverage for people who meet our underwriting criteria 
we offer our life insurance products primarily through an extensive network of independent brokerage general agencies located throughout the us we also offer our life insurance products through affluent market producer groups  financial intermediaries  and insurance marketing organizations 
we believe there are opportunities to expand our sales through each of these distribution channels 
products term life insurance our term life insurance policies provide a death benefit if the insured dies while the coverage is in force 
term life policies lapse with little or no required payment by us at the end of the coverage period if the insured is still alive 
we also offer policyholders the right to convert most of our term insurance policies to specified life insurance policies issued by us 
we seek to reduce the mortality risk associated with conversion by restricting its availability to certain ages and by limiting the period during which the conversion option can be exercised 

table of contents our primary term life insurance products have guaranteed level premiums for initial terms of    or years 
in addition  our year products offer  at the end of the initial term  a second year term of level premiums  which may or may not be guaranteed 
after the guaranteed period expires  premiums increase annually and the policyholder has the option to continue under the current policy by paying the increased premiums without demonstrating insurability or by qualifying for a new policy by submitting again to the underwriting process 
coverage continues until the insured reaches the policy expiration age or the policyholder ceases to make premium payments or otherwise terminates the policy  including potentially converting to a permanent plan of insurance 
the termination of coverage is called a lapse 
for newer policies  we seek to reduce lapses at the end of the guaranteed period by gradually adjusting premiums to the attained age of the insured over the five years following the guaranteed period 
after this phase in period  premiums continue to increase as the insured ages 
vantagepoint sm is a term product with a return of premium feature 
available for initial terms of  or years  it has a cash value rider that provides for a return of of total net paid premiums at the end of the initial term  if a death benefit has not been paid 
cash values begin after the fourth year and are available for policy loans 
universal life insurance our universal life insurance policies provide policyholders with lifetime death benefit coverage  the ability to accumulate assets on a flexible  tax deferred basis  and the option to access the cash value of the policy through a policy loan  partial withdrawal or full surrender 
our universal life products allow policyholders to adjust the timing and amount of premium payments 
we credit premiums paid  less certain expenses  to the policyholder s account and from that account deduct regular expense charges and certain risk charges  known as cost of insurance  which generally increase from year to year as the insured ages 
our universal life insurance policies accumulate cash value that we pay to the policyholder when the policy lapses or is surrendered 
most of our universal life policies also include provisions for surrender charges for early termination and partial withdrawals 
as of december   of our in force block of universal life insurance was subject to surrender charges 
we also sell joint  second to die policies that are typically used for estate planning purposes 
these policies insure two lives rather than one  with the policy proceeds paid after the death of both insured individuals 
we credit interest on policyholder account balances at a rate determined by us  but not less than a contractually or regulatorily mandated guaranteed minimum 
our in force universal life insurance policies generally have minimum guaranteed crediting rates ranging from to for the life of the policy 
underwriting and pricing we believe effective underwriting and pricing are significant drivers of the profitability of our life insurance business  and we have established rigorous underwriting and pricing practices to maximize our profitability 
we retain most of the risk we currently underwrite  thereby limiting the premiums ceded to reinsurers 
we generally reinsure risks in excess of million per life  and the reinsured amount is generally based on the policy amount at the time of issue 
we set pricing assumptions for expected claims  lapses  investment returns  expenses and customer demographics based on our own relevant experience and other factors 
our strategy is to price our products competitively for our target risk categories and not necessarily to be equally competitive in all categories 
our current underwriting guidelines place each insurable life insurance applicant in one of eight primary risk categories  depending upon current health  medical history and other factors 
each of these eight categories has specific health criteria  including the applicant s history of using nicotine products 
we consider each life insurance application individually and apply our guidelines to place each applicant in the appropriate risk category  regardless of face value or net amount at risk 
we may decline an applicant s request for coverage if his 
table of contents health or lifestyle assessment is unacceptable to us 
we do not delegate underwriting decisions to independent sales intermediaries 
instead  underwriting decisions are generally made by our own underwriting personnel or by our automated underwriting system 
we often share information with our reinsurers to gain their insights on potential mortality and underwriting risks and to benefit from their broad expertise 
we use the information we obtain from the reinsurers to help us develop effective strategies to manage those risks 
a key part of our life insurance underwriting program is the streamlined  technology enhanced process called genius  which automates new business processing for term life insurance 
genius has shortened the cycle time from the receipt of an application to issuance of a policy  reduced policy acquisition costs and improved the consistency and accuracy of our underwriting decisions by reducing decision making variation 
long term care insurance overview we offer individual long term care insurance products that provide protection against the high and escalating costs of long term health care provided in the insured s home and in assisted living and nursing facilities 
insureds become eligible for benefits when they are incapable of performing certain activities of daily living or when they become cognitively impaired 
in contrast to health insurance  long term care insurance provides coverage for skilled and custodial care provided outside of a hospital 
the typical claim has a duration of care of approximately to years 
we established ourselves as a pioneer in long term care insurance over years ago 
since that time  we have accumulated extensive pricing and claims experience  which we believe is the most comprehensive in the industry and has enabled us to build what we believe is the largest actuarial database in the industry 
our experience helps us plan for long term  consistent success and has enabled us to develop a disciplined growth strategy built on a foundation of strong risk management  product innovation and a diversified distribution strategy 
in  we introduced a series of product upgrades designed to provide a variety of pricing and benefit options  enhance service capabilities and simplify and broaden our individual product features 
in addition  we launched our group long term care insurance product and expanded our medicare supplement product in a majority of states and have seen growth in these new states 
in january  we agreed to acquire continental life insurance company of brentwood  tennessee  a provider of medicare supplement insurance  for approximately million 
continental life will enhance our presence in medicare supplement insurance by more than doubling our existing annualized premium in force for this product 
the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of total individual long term care insurance premiums for in force policies in the us increased from approximately billion in to billion in  according to limra international 
industry wide sales of individual long term care insurance achieved a historical high in at approximately billion and decreased to million in we believe this decrease was due primarily to decision by several providers to cease offering long term care insurance  to raise premiums on inforce policies and or to introduce new products with higher prices 
these actions resulted in decreased purchases of long term care insurance products and have caused some distributors to reduce their sales focus on these products 
notwithstanding the industry trends  we believe that over time  the long term care insurance market will expand as the result of aging demographics  increasing healthcare and nursing care costs  the uncertainty regarding government programs that currently cover these costs and the increasing public awareness of the benefits of private long term care insurance 
as the leading provider of individual long term care insurance  we have made significant investments to further the education and awareness of the benefits of long term care insurance 
in  we entered into a five year strategic relationship with the alzheimer s association to help sponsor public awareness and eliminate alzheimer s disease through education and the advancement of research 
as a part of this relationship  we will 
table of contents engage in a variety of co branded initiatives including advertising  policyholder and consumer information materials and web support 
in addition  we will continue to sponsor the association s memory walk 
in  we also entered into a strategic alliance with the corporation for long term care certification  inc  a nationally recognized long term care training organization  to educate and train our independent producers in how to help solve clients long term care needs 
through our sponsorship  approximately  producers have attended this program 
throughout our history  we have consistently been a leader in product innovation 
we were one of the first long term care insurers to offer home care coverage and the first to offer shared plan coverage for married couples and domestic partners 
we developed these innovations based upon our risk analytics and in response to policyholder needs and emerging claims experience 
our most recent innovations have included our policyholder wellness initiatives that are designed to improve the overall health of our policyholders 
these initiatives provide valuable services to our policyholders  reduce claims expenses and differentiate us from our competitors 
we distribute our products through diversified sales channels consisting of more than  appointed independent producers  financial intermediaries and  dedicated sales specialists 
approximately employees support these diversified distribution channels 
products our principal product is individual long term care insurance 
prior to the mid s  we issued primarily indemnity policies  which provide for fixed daily amounts for long term care benefits 
since the mid s  we have offered primarily reimbursement policies  which provide for reimbursement of documented and approved expenses for nursing home  assisted living facilities or home care expenses 
as of december   our in force policies consisted of approximately reimbursement policies and indemnity policies  measured on a premium weighted basis 
reimbursement policies permit us to review individual claims expenses and  therefore  provide greater control over claims cost management than indemnity policies 
our products provide customers with a choice of a maximum period of coverage from two years to ten years  as well as lifetime coverage 
our current products also provide customers with different choices for the maximum reimbursement limit for their policy  with to per day being the most common choices nationwide 
our new policies can be purchased with a benefit increase option that provides for increases in the maximum reimbursement limit at a fixed rate of per year  which helps to mitigate customers exposure to increasing long term care costs 
many long term care insurance policies sold in the industry have a feature referred to as an elimination period that is a minimum period of time that an insured must incur the direct cost of care before becoming eligible for policy benefits 
although many of our new policies have no elimination period for home care coverage  the majority of our new policies do have an elimination period for care provided in assisted living and nursing facilities 
all of these product features allow customers to tailor their coverage to meet their specific requirements and allow us to price our products with better predictability regarding future claim costs 
we sell our long term care insurance policies on a guaranteed renewable basis  which means that we are required to renew the policies each year as long as the premium is paid 
the terms of all our long term care insurance policies permit us to increase premiums during the premium paying period if appropriate in light of our experience with a relevant group of policies 
we may increase premiums on a group of policies in response to those policies performance  subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals 
however  we may not increase premiums due to changes in an individual s health status or age 
we also offer medicare supplement insurance providing coverage for medicare qualified expenses that are not covered by medicare because of applicable deductibles or maximum limits 
medicare supplement insurance often appeals to a similar sector of the population as long term care insurance  and we believe we will be able to use our marketing and distribution strengths for long term care insurance products to increase sales of medicare supplement insurance 

table of contents in february  the president signed into law the deficit reduction act of  which included provisions permitting states to participate in long term care partnership program by filing medicaid plan amendments 
under the partnership program  consumers in participating states will benefit because they will be permitted to protect assets equal to the amount of long term care insurance benefits they use without affecting medicaid eligibility 
for example  if a partnership policyholder uses  of long term care insurance benefits  the policyholder will be able to keep  of assets and still access medicaid for remaining care needs 
under the legislation  states seeking to participate in the program need to file medicaid plan amendments with the united states department of health and human services to participate in the partnership program and those amendments will need to be approved 
the legislation s impact on long term care insurance sales in the short term is uncertain as states enroll to participate in the partnership program and as consumers and financial planners begin to understand the medicaid reforms 
in the long term  we expect the partnership feature to expand the long term care insurance market in participating states to purchasers who would otherwise engage in medicaid planning as an alternative to long term care insurance  although we are unable to predict the impact this will have on our future sales 
the united states department of health and human services  or hhs  has also recognized the importance of long term care insurance by sponsoring an educational campaign entitled own your future  which seeks to educate year olds about the need to plan for long term care needs  including considering long term care insurance 
under the campaign  hhs mails out a letter to the target audience in select states  under signature of the state s governor  offering a long term care planning kit which can be obtained by calling a toll free number 
in  hhs launched its campaign in virginia  new jersey  arkansas  idaho  and nevada 
in  hhs will initiate the campaign in kansas  maryland and rhode island 
we expect this campaign to have a favorable impact on sales in states where launched 
underwriting and pricing individual long term care insurance we employ extensive medical underwriting policies and procedures to assess and quantify risks before we issue our long term care insurance policies 
for individual long term care products  we use underwriting criteria that are similar to  but separate from  those we use in underwriting life insurance products 
depending upon an applicant s age and health status  we use a variety of underwriting information sources to determine morbidity risk  or the probability that an insured will be unable to perform activities of daily living or suffer cognitive impairment  and eligibility for insurance 
the process entails a comprehensive application that requests health  prescription drug  and lifestyle and activity related information 
higher risk applicants are also required to participate in an assessment process by telephone or in person 
a critical element of this assessment process is a cognitive examination  in certain cases  to identify early cognitive impairments 
in addition  an experienced long term care insurance underwriter conducts a comprehensive review of the application  the results of the assessment process and  in many cases  complete medical records from the applicant s physicians 
to streamline the underwriting process and improve the accuracy and consistency of our underwriting decisions  we use the genius automated underwriting technology in our long term care insurance business 
we believe we have one of the largest and most experienced long term care insurance claims management operations in the industry 
our claims adjudication process includes  with respect to new claims  a pre claim assessment by an experienced benefits analyst who establishes preliminary claims eligibility  followed by an on site assessment and care coordination phase to validate eligibility and to work with the customer in determining an appropriate plan of care 
continued claims eligibility is verified through an ongoing eligibility assessment for existing claimants 
we will continue to make investments in new processes and technologies that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our long term care insurance expense tracking and claims decision making process 
the overall profitability of our long term care insurance policies depends to a large extent on the degree to which our claims experience  morbidity and mortality experience  lapse rates and investment yields match our 
table of contents pricing assumptions 
we believe we have the largest actuarial database in the industry  derived from over years of experience in offering long term care insurance products 
this database has provided substantial claims experience and statistics regarding morbidity risk  which has helped us to develop a sophisticated pricing methodology for our newer policies tailored to segmented risk categories  depending upon marital status  medical history and other factors 
when we issued our older policies  we did not have the full benefit of this experience and pricing methodology 
we continually monitor trends and developments and update assumptions that may affect the risk  pricing and profitability of our long term care insurance products and adjust our new product pricing and other terms as appropriate 
we also work with a medical advisory board  comprising independent experts from the medical technology and public policy fields  that provides insights on emerging morbidity and medical trends  enabling us to be more proactive in our risk segmentation  pricing and product development strategies 
medicare supplement insurance when allowed by state law  we underwrite our medicare supplement product by asking a series of medical questions on an application and then conducting a phone health interview phi 
the phi is designed to verify the answers submitted on the application and is performed by an experienced medicare supplement professional before the policy is issued 
any discrepancies between the application and the phi are investigated and the application will be declined if warranted 
where allowed by state law  we segment our medicare supplement applicants into risk pools based on age  gender  smoking status and geography 
these risk classifications allow us to mitigate business mix risk by pricing separately for each risk classification 
we perform profitability analyses annually by risk pool and request rate changes from state regulators to maintain our pricing profitability 
in the few situations where state law does not permit these underwriting procedures  we issue policies on a guaranteed basis based on pricing models that account for guaranteed issue requirements in these states 
group long term care insurance the decision to offer group long term care insurance is a two step process including first  an assessment of the employer s risk and second  a risk evaluation of the individual applicant 
to evaluate the eligibility of an employer for group long term care we evaluate the characteristics of the employer including standard industry codes and select demographic measures including age  gender and income 
if the risk associated with the employer is deemed acceptable we then conduct a detailed pricing evaluation considering many of these same characteristics that we use in underwriting individual long term care insurance 
the depth of underwriting is determined by the status of the applicant eg active at work  spouse  parents or retiree  the age of the applicant and the level of the employer s contributions to the employee s coverage 
payment protection insurance overview we provide payment protection insurance to customers throughout europe 
payment protection insurance helps consumers meet their payment obligations on outstanding financial commitments  such as mortgages  personal loans or credit cards  in the event of a misfortune such as illness  involuntary unemployment  temporary incapacity  permanent disability or death 
we currently have a presence in the following countries czech republic  denmark  finland  france  hungary  germany  greece  ireland  italy  the netherlands  norway  poland  portugal  spain  sweden  switzerland and in the u 
k where we have offered payment protection insurance for more than years 
we distribute our payment protection products primarily through financial institutions  such as major european banks  which offer our insurance products in connection with underlying loans or other financial 
table of contents products they sell to their customers 
under these arrangements  the distributors typically take responsibility for branding and marketing the products  allowing us to take advantage of their distribution capabilities  while we take responsibility for pricing  underwriting and claims payment 
we continue to implement innovative methods for distributing our payment protection insurance products  including using web based tools that provide our distributors with a cost effective means of applying and selling our products in combination with a broad range of underlying financial products 
we believe these innovative methods also will make it easier to establish arrangements with new distributors 
as we enter into new arrangements and as existing arrangements become due for renewal  we are focused on maintaining a disciplined approach to growth  with an emphasis on arrangements that achieve our targeted returns on capital and increase our operating earnings 
products our principal product is payment protection insurance  which can support any loan  credit agreement or other financial commitment 
depending upon the type of financial product or commitment  our policies may cover all or a portion of the policyholder s obligation or may cover monthly payments for a fixed period of time 
we are able to customize the circumstances under which benefits are paid from among the range of events that can prevent policyholders from meeting their payment obligations 
in the event of a policyholder s illness  involuntary unemployment or other temporary inability to work  we cover monthly payment obligations until the policyholder is able to return to work  subject  in some cases  to a maximum period 
in the event of a policyholder s death or permanent disability  we typically repay the entire covered obligation 
in addition to payment protection insurance  we offer related consumer protection products  primarily in the uk  including personal accident insurance and product purchase protection 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to take advantage of our european operations and distribution infrastructure to offer consumer protection insurance products throughout europe 
we work with our distributors to design and promote insurance products in ways that best complement their product strategies and risk profiles and to ensure that our products comply with all applicable consumer regulations 
through this close cooperation  we believe there are opportunities to increase the benefit of these arrangements by extending our payment protection insurance products across the full range of consumer finance products offered by our distributors 
we are also working closely with our distributors to help them increase the percentage of their customers who purchase our protection insurance at the time they enter into a loan or financial commitment and reduce the percentage of customers who elect not to renew our policies upon expiration 
consumers generally pay premiums for our insurance to our distributors  who in turn forward these payments to us  typically net of commissions 
consistent with our focus on disciplined growth and returns on capital  as we enter into new arrangements and review existing arrangements with distributors  we seek to manage these arrangements and deploy capital where we believe we can achieve the highest returns while strengthening our client relationships 
in some cases  particularly in the uk  we had arrangements in place that accounted for significant revenue without a corresponding benefit to return on capital 
accordingly  in the third quarter of  we evaluated our contractual relationships with our payment protection insurance distributors against our targeted return thresholds and decided to terminate or not to renew certain relationships that we refer to as run off 
although we expect our revenue to continue to decline over the next few years as existing policies from these less profitable arrangements continue to run off  we believe this will not have a material impact on our operating earnings and will have a favorable effect on our returns as capital is released and redeployed into markets with potential for higher growth and returns 
in october  we also decided to end a relationship with a travel insurance distributor in the uk  from whom we generated million in revenues in we expect revenues from this relationship to continue through 
table of contents we are continuing to diversify and expand our base of distributors 
we are also exploring additional growth opportunities in europe  which we believe will be increasingly receptive to payment protection insurance as consumer lending further develops in those markets 
in addition  we believe the accession of additional countries to the european union will facilitate our entry into those markets 
for the years ended december   and  ge s consumer finance division and other related ge entities accounted for  and of our payment protection insurance gross written premiums  respectively 
the increase from to in the percentage of business relating to ge entities was primarily attributable to the decline in total gross written premiums in our payment insurance business that was due to the significant decrease in premiums relating to our run off block 
in early  we entered into a five year agreement  subject to certain early termination provisions  that extends our relationship with ge s consumer finance division and provides us with the right to be the exclusive provider of payment protection insurance in europe for ge s consumer finance operations in jurisdictions where we offer these products 
the percentage of business relating to ge entities remained relatively flat from to due to the stabilization of the run off block and increased account penetration with existing customers 
underwriting and pricing we have more than years of experience in underwriting payment protection insurance 
consistent with market practices  our payment protection insurance currently is underwritten and priced on a program basis  by type of product and by distributor  rather than on the basis of the characteristics of the individual policyholder 
in setting prices  we take into account the underlying obligation  the particular product features and the average customer profile of the distributor including data such as customer age  gender and occupation 
we also consider morbidity and mortality rates  lapse rates and investment yields in pricing our products 
we believe our experience in underwriting allows us to provide competitive pricing to distributors and generate targeted returns and profits for our business 
group life and health insurance overview we offer a full range of employment based benefit products and services targeted primarily at employers with fewer than  employees  as well as select groups within larger companies that require highly customized benefit plans 
our products include group non medical insurance products  such as dental  vision  life and disability insurance  group medical insurance products  such as stop loss insurance  and individual voluntary products 
we purchase excess of loss reinsurance coverage to limit our exposure to losses from our group non medical and medical insurance lines 
we continue to focus on making it easier for customers to do business with us through an expanded call center and our enhanced on line servicing capabilities 
we implemented a new voluntary administration platform to support our existing and planned group voluntary products 
this new platform gives us the ability to electronically integrate our service platform with the customer service call center that support our employer paid products 
we launched new group voluntary short and long term products in conjunction with a new quoting and risk assessment system 
these products complement our existing group voluntary dental and life offerings 
we use an independent network of approximately  licensed group life and health insurance brokers and agents  supported by our nationwide sales force of approximately employees  to distribute our group life and health insurance products 
individual voluntary products are sold through employers and other worksite based groups using a network of independent insurance producers 
as of december   we provided employment based benefit products and services to more than  organizations  covering approximately million plan participants 

table of contents many of the employers in our target market do not have large human resource departments with individuals devoted to benefit design  administration and budgeting 
as a result  we work closely with independent group benefit brokers and the end customer or employer to design benefit plans to meet the employer s particular requirements 
our customers are small and mid size employers that require knowledgeable independent group benefit brokers and insurance company representatives to understand their individual financial needs and employee profiles and to structure benefit plans that are appropriate for their particular size  geographical markets and resources 
we believe our extensive experience and expertise in group life and health insurance products provide us with opportunities to foster close broker relationships and to assist employers in designing benefit plans  as well as selling traditional insurance products 
products we offer a full range of employee benefits products for the group  group voluntary and individual voluntary markets 
we sell group benefits exclusively to employers  which pay all or most of the applicable premiums 
we sell group voluntary and individual voluntary benefits through employers to employees  who generally pay all or most of the premiums through payroll deductions 
coverage in both group and group voluntary benefits generally ceases upon the termination of employment  whereas coverage in individual voluntary benefits may continue after the termination of employment 
voluntary benefit products enable an employer to expand its available employee benefits without adding to the company s costs 
as a result  these programs allow employees to select benefit packages to meet their individual and family needs and budgets  generally at lower premiums than they would pay for comparable benefit packages assembled independently 
employers help to administer group and group voluntary benefits  and we administer individual voluntary benefits with little involvement from employers 
group non medical insurance our group non medical insurance consists of dental and vision  life and disability insurance products 
dental and vision insurance 
our group dental coverage provides benefits to insured employees and their eligible dependents for specified dental services 
we also offer dental managed care plans  which provide differentiated benefit levels depending upon whether the dental provider is a member of a nationwide network 
vision coverage generally is offered as a supplement to dental coverage 
life insurance 
our group term life insurance product provides benefits in the event of an insured employee s and their covered dependent s death 
the death benefit can be based upon an individual s earnings or occupation  or can be fixed at a set dollar amount 
our products also include optional accidental death and dismemberment coverage as a supplement to our term life insurance policies 
this coverage provides benefits for an insured employee s loss of life  limb or sight as a result of accidental death or injury 
disability insurance 
our group long term disability coverage is designed to cover the risk of employee loss of income during prolonged periods of disability 
our group short term disability coverage provides partial replacement of an insured employee s weekly earnings in the event of disability resulting from an injury or illness 
benefits can be a set dollar amount or based upon a percentage of earnings 
group medical insurance our group medical insurance consists of stop loss insurance and fully insured medical products 
stop loss insurance 
our stop loss insurance coverage is written for employers that self insure their employee medical benefits and covers the risk of higher than expected claims experience 
our coverage provides reimbursement for claims in excess of a predetermined level 

table of contents fully insured medical 
our group medical coverage provides benefits for insured employees and their dependents for hospital  surgical and ancillary medical expenses 
we offer  on a limited basis  several types of plans with a wide range of plan features  such as indemnity plans  which contain deductibles and co insurance payments  and preferred provider organization plans  or ppo plans  which reduce deductibles and co insurance payments for medical services provided by members of a preferred provider network of healthcare providers 
individual voluntary products we offer individual voluntary life and health insurance contracts through worksite marketing programs in which our representatives visit employer premises and make presentations to employees 
our individual health coverage consists primarily of short term disability and hospital indemnity benefits 
short term disability benefit periods generally range from nine months to two years while hospital indemnity benefits generally range from to per day 
although the policies are sold in connection with a benefit package offered to company employees  each policyholder receives an individual policy  and coverage can continue after termination of employment if the policyholder continues to make premium payments 
underwriting and pricing group insurance pricing is different from individual product pricing in that it reflects the group s claims experience  when appropriate 
the risk characteristics of each group are reviewed at the time the policy is issued and each year thereafter  resulting in ongoing adjustments to the group s pricing 
the key rating and underwriting criteria are the group s demographic composition  including the age  gender and family composition of the group s members  the industry of the group  geographic location  regional economic trends  plan design and the group s prior claims experience 
we have a data warehouse that is integrated with all our claims processing systems 
the data warehouse contains at least eight years of experience for each product that helps us predict future experience by modeling the impact of changes in current rates against historic claims 
our automated underwriting quotation and renewal systems efficiently process low risk cases and identify high risk cases for further underwriter review 
we also have developed proprietary automated underwriting techniques that enhance the speed and accuracy of  and reduce variations in  our underwriting decision making 
competition we face significant competition in all our protection segment operations 
our competitors include other large and highly rated insurance carriers 
some of these competitors have greater resources than we do  and many of them offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
we also face competition in our life  long term care and group insurance product lines from independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists 
this competition is based primarily upon product pricing and features  compensation and benefits structure and support services offered 
we continuously provide technology upgrades and enhanced training  and we seek to improve service for our independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists 
in our payment protection insurance business  we are one of the few payment protection insurance providers with operations across europe 
our competitors are divided into two broad groups the large pan european payment protection providers and local competitors  consisting principally of smaller national insurance companies 
we also compete with captive insurers  as our distributors increasingly consider the benefits of providing payment protection insurance directly to their customers 

table of contents retirement income and investments overview through our retirement income and investments segment  we offer fixed and variable deferred annuities and income annuities 
we offer these products to a broad range of consumers who want to accumulate tax deferred assets for retirement  desire a reliable source of income during their retirement  and or seek to protect against outliving their assets during retirement 
we offer fixed and variable deferred annuities  in which assets accumulate until the contract is surrendered  the contractholder dies  the contractholder takes withdrawals or the contractholder begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option 
we also offer fixed and variable income annuities including clearcourse sm for the employer sponsored k market  in which payments begin within one  three or ten years of issue and continue for a fixed period or for life 
we believe our wide range of fixed annuity products has provided a stable source of asset growth during volatile equity and bond markets in recent years  and our variable annuity offerings continue to appeal to contractholders who wish to participate in returns linked to equity and bond markets with many desiring products with options that provide certain minimum guarantees 
we also offer variable life insurance through our retirement income and investments segment  because this product provides investment features that are similar to our variable annuity products 
in addition to our annuity and variable life insurance products  we offer a number of specialty products  including guaranteed investment contracts  or gics  funding agreements including those issued pursuant to our registered notes program and structured settlements 
we sell gics to erisa qualified plans  such as pension and k plans  and we sell funding agreements to money market funds that are not erisa qualified and to other institutional investors 
our structured settlements provide an alternative to a lump sum settlement  generally in a personal injury lawsuit  and typically are purchased by property and casualty insurance companies for the benefit of an injured claimant with benefits scheduled to be paid throughout a fixed period or for the life of the claimant 
in addition  we offer private asset management services for affluent individual investors 
according to limra international  sales of individual annuities were billion in from june through december  the federal reserve increased short term rates from to while long term interest rates remained relatively stable 
this flattening of the yield curve resulted in a shift in demand to shorter duration instruments like bank certificates of deposits and money market funds and away from longer duration products like annuities 
within the fixed annuity market  there was an increasing demand for products with an equity index component  such as equity indexed annuities 
we did not have a product with an equity index component in the market in  but we have launched such a product in the first quarter of in variable annuities  we expect product demand to be primarily driven by product features and guarantees 
although volatility in the equity markets may cause some potential purchasers to refrain from purchasing products such as variable annuities and variable life insurance  many of today s purchasers are seeking to remain invested in the equity markets and at the same time have guarantees to protect their income during their retirement years 
we believe that moderately higher longer term interest rates and greater public awareness about the need for lifetime retirement income protection will result in increased demand for annuities and other investment products that help consumers accumulate assets and provide reliable retirement income 
we have continued to focus on our income distribution series of variable annuity products and riders in response to customers who desire guaranteed minimum income streams with equity market upside at the end of the contribution and accumulation period 
our income distribution series of variable annuity products and riders provides the contractholder with a guaranteed minimum income stream that they cannot outlive  along with an opportunity to participate in market appreciation  but reduce some of the risks to insurers that generally accompany traditional products with guaranteed minimum income benefits 
we are targeting people who are focused on building a personal portable retirement plan or are moving from the accumulation to the distribution phase of their retirement planning 
during  we introduced our clearcourse sm product for the employer sponsored k market 
clearcourse sm is designed to be an option within a k plan and offers participants the ability to purchase guaranteed retirement income while maintaining liquidity and the opportunity for market 
table of contents upside 
clearcourse sm provides plan participants with the ability to access defined benefit like features within a defined contribution environment 
in october we also introduced a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for the life product  lifetime income plus  that was added to our income distribution series products 
this product filled a customer need within our income distribution series for guaranteed income payments that the customer cannot outlive  along with the opportunity for appreciation  similar to our retireready sm retirement answer variable annuity retirement answer formerly known as ge retirement answer  and added significant liquidity features 
our income distribution series products are composed of our retirement income and annuity product and four variable annuity riders that provide similar income features 
as an enhancement to our spread institutional business  we initiated a billion registered notes program secured by funding agreements in our subsidiaries 
this program became effective in december and provides us the ability to issue fixed or floating rate offerings with maturities ranging from months to years 
our initial issuance through this program was a five year  million floating rate funding agreement  which was funded during december we offer our annuities and other investment products primarily through financial institutions and specialized brokers  as well as independent accountants and independent advisers associated with our captive broker dealer 
we provide extensive training and support to our distributors through a wholesaling sales force that specializes in retirement income needs

during the accumulation period  we credit the account value of the annuity with interest earned at an interest rate  called the crediting rate 
the crediting rate is guaranteed generally for one year but may be guaranteed for up to seven years  at the contractholders option  and thereafter is subject to annual changes at our discretion  based upon competitive factors  prevailing market rates and product profitability 
each contract also has a minimum guaranteed crediting rate 
our fixed annuity contracts are funded by our general account  and the accrual of 
table of contents interest during the accumulation period is generally on a tax deferred basis to the owner 
the majority of our fixed annuity contractholders retain their contracts for to years 
after the period specified in the annuity contract  the contractholder may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity as a single payment or over time 
our fixed annuity contracts permit the contractholder at any time during the accumulation period to withdraw all or part of the premiums paid  plus the amount credited to his account  subject to contract provisions such as surrender charges that vary depending upon the terms of the product 
the contracts impose surrender charges that typically vary from to of the account value  starting in the year of deposit and decreasing to zero over a to year period 
the contractholder also may withdraw annually up to of the account value without any contractual penalty 
approximately billion  or of the total account value of our fixed annuities as of december   were subject to surrender charges 
at least once each month  we set an interest crediting rate for newly issued fixed spdas and additional deposits 
we maintain the initial crediting rate for a minimum period of one year or the guarantee period  whichever is longer 
thereafter  we may adjust the crediting rate no more frequently than once per year for any given deposit 
our recently issued annuity contracts have minimum guaranteed crediting rates between and 
fixed immediate annuities in exchange for a single premium  fixed immediate annuities provide a fixed amount of income for either a defined number of years  the annuitant s lifetime  or the greater of the two periods 
income can be paid monthly  quarterly  semi annually or annually and generally begins within one year of receipt of the premium 
fixed immediate annuities also include annuitizations chosen as a settlement option for an existing deferred annuity contract 
our fixed immediate annuities differ from deferred annuities in that they provide for contractually guaranteed payments that begin within one year of issue 
fixed immediate annuities do not provide for surrender or policy loans by the contractholder  and therefore they provide us with the opportunity to match closely the underlying investment of the deposit received to the cash benefits to be paid under a policy and provide for an anticipated margin for expenses and profit  subject to credit  reinvestment and  in some cases  mortality risk 
the two most common types of fixed immediate annuities are the life contingent annuity  which makes payments for the life of a contractholder  and the joint and survivor annuity  which continues to make payments to a second contractholder  such as a spouse  after the death of the contractholder 
we also offer period certain annuities  which generally make payments for a minimum period from to years even if the contractholder dies within the term certain period 
fixed immediate annuities typically are sold to contractholders approaching retirement 
we anticipate higher sales of fixed immediate annuities with the demographic shift toward more people reaching retirement age and focusing on their need for dependable retirement income 
structured settlements structured settlement contracts provide an alternative to a lump sum settlement  generally in a personal injury lawsuit or workers compensation claim  and typically are purchased by property and casualty insurance companies for the benefit of an injured claimant 
the structured settlements provide scheduled payments over a fixed period or  in the case of a life contingent structured settlement  for the life of the claimant with a guaranteed minimum period of payments 
structured settlement contracts also may provide for irregularly scheduled payments to coincide with anticipated medical or other claimant needs 
these settlements offer tax advantaged  long range financial security to the injured party and facilitate claim settlement for the property and casualty insurance carrier 
structured settlement contracts are long term in nature  guarantee a fixed benefit stream and generally do not permit surrender or borrowing against the amounts outstanding under the contract 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we ceded all of our in force structured settlements business to union fidelity life insurance company uflic 
we continue to write structured settlements selectively when we believe we will be able to achieve our targeted returns  capitalizing on our experience and relationships in this product 

table of contents spread based institutional products we offer gics and funding agreements including those issued pursuant to our registered notes program which are deposit type products that pay a guaranteed return to the contractholder on specified dates 
gics are purchased by erisa qualified plans  including pension and k plans 
funding agreements are purchased by institutional accredited investors for various kinds of funds and accounts that are not erisa qualified 
purchasers of funding agreements include money market funds  bank common trust funds and other corporate and trust accounts and private investors including genworth global funding trust as part of our registered notes program 
substantially all our gics allow for the payment of benefits at contract value on a pro rata basis as to plan participants to erisa plan participants prior to contract maturity in the event of death  disability  retirement or change in investment election 
we carefully underwrite these risks before issuing a gic to a plan and historically have been able to effectively manage our exposure to these benefit payments 
our gics typically credit interest at a fixed interest rate and have a fixed maturity generally ranging from two to six years 
our funding agreements generally credit interest on deposits at a floating rate tied to an external market index 
to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  we invest the proceeds backing floating rate funding agreements in floating rate assets 
some of our funding agreements are purchased by money market funds  bank common trust funds and other short term investors 
these funding agreements typically are renewed annually  and generally contain put provisions  through which the contractholder has an option to terminate the funding agreement for any reason after giving notice within the contract s specified notice period  which is generally days 
as of december   we had an aggregate of billion of floating rate funding agreements outstanding  compared to billion as of december  of the billion aggregate amount outstanding as of december   billion had put option features  including million with put option features of days and the remaining million with put option features of days 
we also issue funding agreements to trust accounts to back medium term notes purchased by investors 
these contracts typically are issued for terms of one to seven years 
as of december   we had an aggregate of billion of these funding agreements  compared to billion as of december  of the billion of these funding agreements outstanding as of december   billion permitted early termination provisions upon twelve months notice and billion permit early termination upon twenty one months notice 
the remainder of these funding agreements did not permit early termination 
fee based products variable annuities we offer variable annuities that allow the contractholder to make payments into a separate account that is divided into subaccounts that invest in underlying mutual funds 
the contractholder also has an option to make allocations to a guaranteed interest rate account that is a part of our general account 
all allocations are determined by the contractholder 
like a deferred fixed annuity  a deferred variable annuity has an accumulation period and a payout period 
the main difference between our fixed annuity products and our variable annuity products is that the variable annuities allow the contractholder to allocate all or a portion of his account value to separate accounts that invest in investment accounts that are distinct from our general account 
assets allocated to each separate account have subaccounts that track the performance of selected mutual funds 
there is no guaranteed minimum rate of return in these subaccounts  and the contractholder bears the entire risk associated with the performance of these subaccounts 
some of our variable annuities also permit the contractholder to allocate all or a portion of his account value to our general account  in which case we credit interest at specified rates  subject to certain guaranteed minimums 
similar to our fixed annuities  our variable annuity contracts permit the contractholder to withdraw all or part of the premiums paid  plus the amount credited to his account  subject to contract terms such as surrender charges 
the cash surrender value of a variable annuity contract depends upon the value of the assets that have been allocated to the contract  how long those assets have been in the contract and the investment performance of the subaccounts that invest in the mutual funds to which the contractholder has allocated assets 

table of contents variable annuities provide us with fee based revenue in the form of expense charges and  in some cases  mortality charges 
the fees equal a percentage of the contractholder s assets in the separate account and typically range from to per annum 
we also receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate account to cover administrative costs and  in some cases  a distribution fee from the underlying mutual funds in which assets are invested 
our variable annuity contracts provide a basic guaranteed minimum death benefit  or gmdb  which provides a minimum account value to be paid upon the annuitant s death 
contractholders also have the option to purchase through riders  at an additional charge  enhanced death benefits 
assuming every annuitant died on december   as of that date  contracts with death benefit features not covered by reinsurance had an account value of billion and a related death benefit exposure of million net amount at risk 
in  we raised prices of  and reduced certain benefits under  our newly issued gmdbs 
we continue to evaluate our pricing  hedging and reinsurance of gmdb features and intend to change prices as appropriate 
in addition  in  we introduced a variable annuity product with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit  or gmwb 
this product provides a guaranteed annual withdrawal of a fixed portion of the initial deposit over a fixed period of time  but requires a balanced asset allocation of the contractholder s separate account deposit 
in  we expanded our gmwb lineup by offering a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for the life of the contractholder while maintaining our requirement for a balanced assets allocation of the contractholder s separate account deposit 
gmwb for life is a component of our income distribution series of variable annuity products and riders 
with some employers moving away from traditional defined benefit pension plans to k plans  in october we responded by introducing clearcourse sm  a group variable annuity product 
the clearcourse sm product is designed to represent an investment option within a company s k retirement plan 
it offers participants the ability to build guaranteed retirement income while maintaining liquidity and growth potential 
clearcourse sm provides participants with the ability to access defined benefit like features within a defined contribution environment 
the product is distributed via direct salespeople and through third party benefits administrators 
we continually review potential new variable annuity products and pursue only those where we believe we can achieve targeted returns in light of the risks involved 
unlike several of our competitors  we have not offered variable annuity products with traditional guaranteed minimum income benefits  or gmibs  or with guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits  or gmabs 
traditional gmib products guarantee an annuitization value for guaranteed income payments equal to the premium accumulated at a specified minimum appreciation rate for a defined period of time  after which annuity payments commence 
gmab products guarantee a customer s account value will be no less than the original investment at the end of a specified accumulation period  plus a specified interest rate 
although we do not offer traditional gmibs or gmabs  we have been able to capitalize on the demand for products with guarantees with our retirement answer product 
retirement answer is a variable deferred annuity that has a minimum year scheduled deposit period for customers who desire guaranteed minimum income streams at the end of an accumulation period 
the income stream may exceed the guaranteed minimum based upon the performance of the subaccount investing in the mutual fund underlying the separate accounts 
as of december   we had billion of lump sum deposits  collected scheduled periodic deposits  and future scheduled periodic deposits for this product 
based on key product design features  some of which have patents pending  we believe retirement answer allows us to provide our customers with a guaranteed income annuity product that mitigates a number of the risks that accompany traditional guaranteed minimum income benefits offered by many of our competitors 
retirement answer is a component of our income distribution series of variable annuity products and riders 
the income distribution series also includes guaranteed income advantage  or gia  and principal protection advantage  or ppa 
gia is a rider to several of our variable annuity products that provides retirement 
table of contents benefits similar to retirement answer which requires contractholders to allocate assets to a specific investment option to obtain the minimum guarantee 
ppa requires investment in available balanced funds and or an approved asset allocation strategy 
the retirement answer and the gia require a minimum ten year accumulation period  and the ppa  which is designed for purchasers nearing retirement  requires only a three year accumulation period before annuitization 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we ceded our in force variable annuities business  excluding the retirement answer product and a small block of contracts in run off  to uflic 
variable life insurance we offer variable life insurance products that provide insurance coverage through a policy that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and  in some products  in premium payments and coverage amounts 
our variable life products allow the policyholder to allocate all or a portion of his premiums to separate subaccounts that invest in investment accounts that are distinct from our general account 
assets allocated to each separate subaccount track the performance of selected mutual funds 
there is no guaranteed minimum rate of return in these subaccounts  and the policyholder bears the entire investment risk associated with the performance of the subaccounts 
some of our variable life insurance products also permit the policyholder to allocate all or a portion of his account value to our general account  in which case we credit interest at specified rates  subject to certain guaranteed minimums  which are comparable to the minimum rates in effect for our fixed annuities 
similar to our variable annuity products  we collect specified mortality and expense charges  fees charged on assets allocated to the separate subaccount to cover administrative services and costs  and a portion of the management fees from the various underlying mutual funds in which the assets are invested 
we collect the cost of insurance charges on our variable life insurance products to compensate us for the mortality risk of the guaranteed death benefit  particularly in the early years of the policy when the death benefit is significantly higher than the value of the policyholder s account 
asset management we offer asset management services to affluent individual investors 
most of our clients for these services have accumulated significant capital  and our principal asset management strategy is to help protect their assets while taking advantage of opportunities for capital appreciation 
our asset management clients are referred to us through financial advisers 
we work with these financial advisers to develop portfolios consisting of individual securities  mutual funds and variable annuities designed to meet each client s particular investment objectives 
our products consist of separately managed accounts  managed mutual funds accounts  and managed variable annuity services 
for each of these products  we receive a management fee based upon the amount of assets under management 
separately managed accounts are individually managed client portfolios that we structure based on the client s needs and investment objectives  with securities recommended by multiple institutional investment advisors according to defined investment strategies 
our clients directly own the securities in their individual portfolios  and we continuously monitor and evaluate each investment advisor and the investment performance in each portfolio 
we also offer advisory services to help clients invest in a variety of mutual funds and other securities 
by working in cooperation with our clients financial advisers  we seek to achieve each client s investment objectives by selecting the appropriate mutual funds 
our asset management services generally require minimum investments of  as of december   we managed more than billion for more than  accounts 
our retail broker dealers have approximately  affiliated financial professionals  who sell annuity and insurance products  including our proprietary products  as well as third party mutual funds and other investment 
table of contents products 
in connection with these sales  we receive commission and fee income from purchasers  and we pay a portion of the commissions and fees to financial professionals 
prior to the completion of the ipo  we offered a broad range of institutional asset management services to third parties 
ge asset management incorporated  or geam  provided the portfolio management services for this business  and we provided marketing  sales and support services 
we did not acquire the institutional asset management services business from ge financial assurance holdings  inc  or gefahi  but we will continue to provide services to geam and gefahi related to this asset management business  including client introduction services  asset retention services and compliance support 
gefahi has agreed to pay us a fee of up to million per year for four years to provide these services 
the fee will be determined based upon the level of third party assets under the management of geam over the four year term 
unless renewed  this agreement will expire on december  as of january   we entered into three agreements with affiliates of ge to manage a pool of municipal guaranteed investment contracts issued by those affiliates 
pursuant to these agreements  we have agreed to originate gic liabilities and advise the ge affiliates regarding the investment  administration and management of their assets that support those liabilities 
under two of those agreements  we receive an administration fee of per annum of the maximum program size for those ge affiliates  which is billion 
the agreements also provide for termination fees in the event of early termination at the option of either affiliate 
under a third agreement with another affiliate  we receive a management fee of per annum of the book value of the investment contracts or similar securities issued by this affiliate after january   which was billion as of december  the fee we receive on the contracts issued by that affiliate before january  is based upon a pricing arrangement that varies depending upon the maturities of those contracts and that affiliate s cost of capital 
the book value of the contracts issued before january  was billion as of december  and is expected to generate a weighted average fee of approximately in we also will receive reimbursement of our operating expenses under each of these agreements 
the initial term of each of the three agreements will expire december   and unless terminated at the option of either party  each agreement will automatically renew on january of each year for successive terms of one year 
underwriting and pricing we generally do not underwrite individual lives in our annuity products  other than structured settlements and some income annuities 
instead  we price our products based upon our expected investment returns and our expectations for mortality  longevity and persistency for the group of our contractholders as a whole  taking into account mortality improvements in the general population and our historical experience 
we price deferred annuities by analyzing longevity and persistency risk  volatility of expected earnings on our assets under management  and the expected time to retirement 
we price our gics using customized pricing models that estimate both expected cash flows and likely variance from those expectations caused by reallocations of assets by plan participants 
we price income annuities and structured settlements using our mortality experience and assumptions regarding continued improvement in annuitant longevity  as well as assumptions regarding investment yields at the time of issue and thereafter 
competition we face significant competition in all our retirement income and investments businesses 
many other companies actively compete for sales in our markets  including other major insurers  banks  other financial institutions  mutual fund and money asset management firms and specialty providers 
in many of our product lines  we face competition from competitors that have greater market share or breadth of distribution  offer a broader range of products  services or features  assume a greater level of risk  have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims paying ratings than we do 
many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
the substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years has intensified pressure on margins and production levels and has increased the level of competition in many of our business lines 

table of contents mortgage insurance overview through our mortgage insurance segment  we offer mortgage insurance in the us  canada  australia  europe  new zealand  mexico and japan 
we also are exploring opportunities in europe  latin america and asia 
private mortgage insurance expands homeownership opportunities by enabling borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages  which are usually defined as loans with a down payment of less than of the home s value 
low down payment mortgages are sometimes also referred to as high loan to value mortgages 
mortgage insurance products increase the funds available for residential mortgages by protecting mortgage lenders and investors against loss in the event of a borrower s default 
these products generally also aid financial institutions in managing their capital efficiently by reducing the capital required for low down payment mortgages 
if a borrower defaults on mortgage payments  private mortgage insurance reduces and  in some instances  eliminates the loss to the insured institution 
private mortgage insurance also facilitates the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market 
we have been providing mortgage insurance products and services in the us since and now operate in all states in the us and the district of columbia 
according to inside mortgage finance  in  we were the fifth largest provider of mortgage insurance in the us  based on flow new insurance written 
we expanded our operations internationally throughout the s and today we believe we are the largest provider of mortgage insurance outside the us in  we were the leading provider in australia based upon flow new insurance written and primary insurance in force  and one of two major insurers in canada 
we are a leading private mortgage insurance provider in europe  based upon flow new insurance written  and have a growing presence in the developing private mortgage insurance markets in mexico and japan 
in addition to private mortgage insurance  we provide lenders with various underwriting and other products and services related to home mortgage lending

table of contents us mortgage insurance overview the us private mortgage insurance industry is defined in large part by the requirements and practices of fannie mae  freddie mac and other large mortgage investors 
fannie mae and freddie mac purchase residential mortgages from mortgage lenders and investors  as part of their governmental mandate to provide liquidity in the secondary mortgage market 
for the first nine months of  fannie mae and freddie mac purchased approximately of all the mortgage loans originated in the us  as compared to for  according to statistics published by inside the gses 
we believe the significant reduction in the percentage of mortgages purchased by fannie mae and freddie mac has reduced the market size for flow private mortgage insurance 
mortgages guaranteed by fannie mae or freddie mac totaled more than trillion as of december   or approximately of the total outstanding mortgage debt in the us in connection with these activities  fannie mae and freddie mac also have established mortgage loan origination  documentation  servicing and selling requirements and standards for the loans they purchase 
in addition  fannie mae s and freddie mac s current eligibility requirements provide that they will accept private mortgage insurance only from insurers that maintain financial strength ratings of at least aa by s p and aa by moody s 
fannie mae and freddie mac are government sponsored enterprises  and we refer to them as the gses 
the gses may purchase mortgages with unpaid principal amounts up to a specified maximum 
the maximum single family principal balance loan limit eligible for purchase by the gses is called the conforming loan limit 
it is currently  and subject to annual adjustment 
each gse s congressional charter generally prohibits it from purchasing a mortgage where the loan to value ratio exceeds of home value unless the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of of the value of the property securing the mortgage is protected against default by lender recourse  participation or by a qualified insurer 
as a result  high loan to value mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac generally are insured with private mortgage insurance 
fannie mae and freddie mac purchased the majority of the flow loans we insured as of december  the majority of our us mortgage insurance policies provide default loss protection on a portion typically of the balance of an individual mortgage loan 
most of our primary mortgage insurance policies are flow insurance policies  which cover individual loans at the time the loan is originated 
we also enter into bulk transactions with lenders and investors in selected instances  under which we insure a portfolio of loans for a negotiated price 
bulk insurance constituted less than of our new risk written for each of the years ended december  and in addition to flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance business  we have written mortgage insurance on a pool basis 
under pool insurance  the mortgage insurer provides coverage on a group of specified loans  typically for of all losses on every loan in the portfolio  subject to an agreed aggregate loss limit 
products and services primary mortgage insurance flow insurance 
flow insurance is primary mortgage insurance placed on an individual loan when the loan is originated 
our primary mortgage insurance covers default risk on first mortgage loans generally secured by one to four unit residential properties  and can be used to protect mortgage lenders and investors from default on any type of residential mortgage loan instrument that we have approved 
our insurance covers a specified coverage percentage of a claim amount consisting of unpaid loan principal  delinquent interest and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure 
as the insurer  we generally are required to pay the coverage percentage of a claim amount specified in the primary policy  but we also have the option to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal  delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure  and acquire title to the property 
in addition  the claim amount may be reduced or 
table of contents eliminated if the loss on the defaulted loan is reduced as a result of the lender s disposition of the property 
the lender selects the coverage percentage at the time the loan is originated  often to comply with investor requirements to reduce the loss exposure on loans purchased by the investor 
for a year fixed rate mortgage  the most common mortgage product in the us  the gses generally require coverage percentages of for loan to value ratios  determined at loan origination  of greater than  for loan to value ratios of  for loan to value ratios of and for loan to value ratios of 
however  the gses may alter their coverage requirements and propose different product structures  and we also offer a range of other mortgage insurance products that provide greater or lesser coverage amounts 
the borrower s mortgage loan instrument generally requires the borrower to pay the mortgage insurance premium 
in other cases  no insurance requirement is imposed upon the borrower  in which case the lender pays the premium and recovers those payments through the interest rate charged on the mortgage 
our mortgage insurance premiums for flow insurance typically are paid monthly  with more than of flow new insurance written during each of the last three years paid monthly  but premiums also may be paid annually or in a single  lump sum payment 
we are not permitted to terminate our mortgage insurance coverage in force  except for non payment of premium or material breach of policy conditions 
the insurance remains renewable at the option of the policyholder  usually at the renewal rate fixed when the loan was initially insured 
as a result  we are not able to raise prices on existing policies to respond to unanticipated default patterns 
in addition  our policyholders may cancel their insurance at any time at their option  including when a mortgage is repaid  which may be accelerated by mortgage refinancings in times of falling interest rates 
cancellations are primarily driven by the prevailing interest rate environment  home price appreciation trends and the cancellation policies of the gses and other investors 
under the us homeowners protection act  or the hpa  a borrower generally has the right to terminate private mortgage insurance coverage on loans closed after july  secured by a single dwelling property that is the borrower s primary residence when certain loan to value ratio thresholds are met 
in general  a borrower may stop making mortgage insurance payments when the loan to value ratio is scheduled to reach based upon the loan s amortization schedule established at loan origination if the borrower so requests and if certain requirements relating to the borrower s payment history and the property s value since origination are satisfied 
in addition  a borrower s obligation to make payments for private mortgage insurance generally terminates regardless of whether a borrower so requests when the loan to value ratio reaches of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage 
some states require mortgage servicers to notify borrowers periodically of the circumstances in which they may request a mortgage servicer to cancel private mortgage insurance 
some states allow the borrower to request that the mortgage servicer cancel private mortgage insurance or require the mortgage servicer to cancel such insurance automatically when the circumstances permitting cancellation occur 
the level of new mortgage originations in the us was  billion and  billion for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this compares to  billion of new mortgage originations for the year ended december  we believe the decrease in mortgage originations since was principally driven by two factors 
first  increasing interest rates in and made refinancing of existing mortgages less attractive to consumers than in prior years 
second  with historically low interest rates in and  many mortgages for which refinancing would otherwise have been economically attractive were already refinanced 
as a result  our us flow persistency increased from for the year ended december  to for each of the years ended december  and continued interest rate increases may have a favorable impact on persistency and could have an adverse impact on new mortgage originations 
if home price appreciation slows  policy cancellations may decline  which would positively affect our us flow persistency rate 

table of contents we continue to develop innovative mortgage insurance products that are designed to attract first time home buyers and expand the scope of the traditional mortgage insurance market 
for example  we have launched our homeopeners products monthlyplus  paymentplus and lenderplus 
our monthlyplus product combines a mortgage insurance policy with involuntary unemployment coverage on mortgage payments for a specified period of time in the event of involuntary job loss or accidental death 
our paymentplus and lenderplus products are designed to compete with simultaneous second mortgages  as described below under competition mortgage lenders and other investors 
bulk insurance under our primary bulk insurance  we insure a portfolio of loans in a single  bulk transaction 
generally  in our bulk insurance  the individual loans in the insured portfolio are insured to specified levels of coverage  and there is an aggregate loss limit applicable to all of the insured loans 
we base the premium on our bulk insurance upon our evaluation of the overall risk of the insured loans included in a transaction  and we negotiate the premium directly with the securitizer or other owner of the loans 
most of our bulk insurance business through has related to loans financed by lenders who participate in the mortgage programs sponsored by the federal home loan banks fhlbs 
in addition to the fhlb business  we also participate in alt a programs with fannie mae and freddie mac where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns 
premiums for bulk transactions generally are paid monthly by lenders or investors or a securitization vehicle in connection with a securitization transaction or the sale of a loan portfolio 
the loans we insure in bulk transactions typically consist of prime credit quality loans with loan to value ratios of to 
we generally have avoided the sub prime segments of the market  because we believe market pricing for mortgage insurance on sub prime bulk transactions has not been adequate and we have had concerns regarding the volatility of this segment 
however  we may consider insuring such loans where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns 
loans that we insure in bulk transactions with loan to value ratios above typically have primary mortgage insurance on a flow basis  written either by us or another private mortgage insurer 
our mortgage insurance coverage levels in bulk transactions typically range from to 
pool insurance in addition to our flow and bulk primary mortgage insurance  we previously have written mortgage insurance on a pool basis 
pool insurance generally is used as an additional credit enhancement for secondary market mortgage transactions 
we ceased writing pool insurance in because of relatively high losses on pool policies  resulting primarily from inadequate pricing  loss severity and risk concentration in certain parts of the country 
however in  we began writing pool insurance for state housing finance agencies where we believe we will be able to achieve our target returns 
our pool insurance in force  which relates primarily to policies written between and  generally covers the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds either the claim payment under the primary coverage if primary insurance is required on that loan or the total loss if that loan does not require primary insurance  in each case up to a stated aggregate loss limit 
mortgage loans we insured in pool insurance with loan to value ratios above typically are covered by flow mortgage insurance  written either by us or another private mortgage insurer 
contract underwriting services we perform fee based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders 
historically  lenders and mortgage insurers each maintained underwriting staffs and performed separate  and in many ways duplicative  underwriting activities with respect to each mortgage loan 
over time  lenders and mortgage insurers have developed a number of arrangements designed to eliminate those inefficiencies 
the provision of underwriting services by mortgage insurers serves this purpose and speeds the approval process 

table of contents the principal contract underwriting service we provide is determining whether the data relating to a borrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lender s loan underwriting guidelines or the investor s loan purchase requirements 
in connection with that service  we also compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of fannie mae and freddie mac  which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements 
if the loan being reviewed requires mortgage insurance under the applicable lender or investor criteria  we also underwrite the loan to our mortgage insurance guidelines and issue the appropriate mortgage insurance coverage 
we believe our contract underwriting services appeal to mortgage lenders because they enable lenders to reduce their costs and improve their operating efficiencies 
under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements  we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria  subject to contractual limitations on liability 
new risk written by our contract underwriters represented of our new risk written for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
captive reinsurance captive reinsurance is a reinsurance program in which we share portions of our us mortgage insurance risk written on loans originated or purchased by lenders with captive reinsurance companies  or captive reinsurers  affiliated with these lenders 
in return  we cede to the captive reinsurers an agreed portion of our gross premiums on flow insurance written 
new insurance written through the bulk channel generally is not subject to these arrangements 
the following table sets forth selected financial information regarding our captive reinsurance arrangements  as of or for the periods indicated as of or for the years ended december  primary risk in force subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of total primary risk in force gross written premiums ceded pursuant to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of total gross written premiums primary new risk written subject to captive reinsurance arrangements  as a percentage of total primary new risk written customers our principal mortgage insurance customers are originators of residential mortgage loans  such as mortgage banks  savings institutions  commercial banks  mortgage brokers  credit unions and other lenders  who typically determine which mortgage insurer or insurers they will use for the placement of mortgage insurance written on loans they originate 
to obtain primary insurance written on a flow basis  a mortgage lender must first apply for and receive from us a mortgage guaranty master policy 
in recent years  there has been significant consolidation among the largest lenders  which now underwrite a substantial portion of all the mortgages written in the us our top ten lenders accounted for an aggregate of of our flow new insurance written for the year ended december  we are focused on expanding our presence throughout the mortgage loan market by providing superior customer sales support  product offerings designed to meet the specific needs of our customers  and technology products designed to enable customers to reduce costs and expand revenues 
in addition  as discussed under 
table of contents operations and technology  we have developed web based technology services that enable our customers to interact more efficiently with us 
underwriting and pricing loan applications for all loans we insure are reviewed to evaluate each individual borrower s credit strength and history  the characteristics of the loan and the value of the underlying property 
this analysis generally includes reviewing the following criteria the borrower s credit strength and history  as reported by credit reporting agencies  the borrower s debt to income ratios where income is disclosed  the loan to value ratio  the type of mortgage instrument  the purpose of the loan  the type of property  and appraisals to confirm the property market value is fairly stated 
loan applications for primary mortgage insurance are reviewed by our employees directly as part of our traditional underwriting process or by our contract underwriters as we process mortgage loan applications requiring mortgage insurance 
some mortgage lenders also underwrite loan applications for mortgage insurance under a delegated underwriting program  in which we permit approved lenders to commit us to insure loans using underwriting guidelines we have previously approved 
before granting a lender delegated underwriting authority  our risk management personnel review the lender s underwriting experience and processes  loan quality and specific loan programs to be included in the delegated program 
in addition  we conduct audits on a sample of the delegated loans we insure to confirm that lenders with delegated authority adhere to approved underwriting guidelines and procedures 
the majority of mortgage loans we insure today are underwritten using fannie mae s and freddie mac s automated underwriting systems  or aus  which lenders have widely adopted due to the gses requirements and the efficiencies that aus provide 
we have evaluated loans approved by fannie mae s and freddie mac s aus and  like other mortgage insurers  we generally have agreed to insure loans approved by these systems 
under the delegated underwriting program  lenders may use their own aus provided we have reviewed and approved their system 
aus have automated many of the underwriting steps that were previously performed by underwriters on a manual basis and use sophisticated mortgage scoring methodologies to evaluate borrower default risk 
although we review aus before allowing their use under our delegated program  under which lenders have the responsibility to determine whether the loans comply with our approved underwriting guidelines  a potential risk to us of using aus is factors we might otherwise evaluate in making an underwriting decision are not considered if not required by aus 
loans insured under our delegated underwriting program accounted for approximately of our total risk in force as of december   compared to as of december  and the percentage of new risk written by delegated underwriters was for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in pricing mortgage insurance policies  we generally target substantially similar returns on capital regardless of the loan to value ratio  product type and depth of coverage 
we establish premium rates principally on the basis of long term claims experience in the industry  reflecting periods of lower and higher losses and various regional economic downturns 
we believe over the long term each region of the us will be subject to similar factors affecting risk of loss on insurance written  and  therefore  we generally use a nationally based premium rate policy  
table of contents rather than a regional  local or lender based policy 
our premium rates vary with the coverage percentage and the perceived risk of a claim on the insured loan  which takes into account the loan to value ratio  the type of mortgage and the term of the mortgage 
our premium rates also reflect our expectations  based upon our analysis of historical data  of the persistency of the policies in our book of business 
our premium rates also take into account competitive alternatives available to consumers  including rates offered by other mortgage insurers 
for a certain number of our products  our premium rates do vary based on the location of the borrower s credit score within a range of credit scores 
in accordance with industry practice  we use the fico score as one indicator of a borrower s credit quality 
fair isaac and company  or fico  developed the fico credit scoring model to calculate a fico score based upon a borrower s credit history 
the higher the credit score  the lower the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan 
fico credit scores range up to  with a score of or more generally viewed as a prime loan and a score below generally viewed as a sub prime loan 
a minus loans generally are loans where the borrowers have fico credit scores between and  and where the borrower has a blemished credit history 
some of our products require a minimum fico score and or have rates based on fico scores 
as of december   on a risk in force basis  approximately of our flow insurance loans had fico credit scores of at least  approximately had fico credit scores between and  and approximately had fico scores of or less 
as of december   on a risk in force basis  approximately of our bulk insurance loans had fico credit scores of at least  approximately had fico credit scores between and  and approximately had fico scores of or less 
the majority of loans we currently insure in bulk transactions meet the conforming loan limit and have fico credit scores of at least after  we significantly reduced writing insurance of loans in bulk transactions that included non conforming and lesser quality loans  such as a minus loans and sub prime loans  because we believe market pricing was inadequate to compensate us for the risk 
we also provide mortgage insurance for alt a loans  which are originated under programs in which there is a reduced level of verification or disclosure of the borrower s income or assets 
for an alt a loan  the borrower s credit strength and history and the appraised value of the property are carefully reviewed 
we also impose limitations on alt a loans  including limitations with respect to the purpose of the loan and the type of property 
alt a loans represented  and of our risk in force as of december   and  respectively 
we also provide insurance for loans with an initial interest only payment option 
the interest only payment option allows the borrower flexibility to pay interest only  or to pay interest and as much principal as desired  during an initial period of time 
we impose credit score  occupancy type and loan to value restrictions on these loans 
interest only loans represented of our us risk in force as of december  and or less as of december  and prior

loans in default and claims our default management process begins with notification by the loan servicer of a default on an insured loan 
default is defined in our master policies as the borrower s failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage 
generally  the master policies require an insured to notify us of a default no later than ten days after the borrower has been in default by three monthly payments 
in most cases  however  defaults are reported earlier 
we generally consider a loan to be in default and establish reserves if the borrower has failed to make a required mortgage payment for two consecutive months 
borrowers default for a variety of reasons  including a reduction of income  unemployment  divorce  illness  inability to manage credit and interest rate levels 
borrowers may cure defaults by making all of the delinquent loan payments or by selling the property in full satisfaction of all amounts due under the mortgage 
in most cases  defaults that are not cured result in a claim under our policy

the two tables below set forth our primary default rates for the various regions of the us and the ten largest states by our risk in force as of december  default rates are shown by region based upon location of the underlying property  rather than the location of the lender

table of contents percent of primary risk in force as of december  default rate december  florida texas new york illinois georgia north carolina pennsylvania ohio new jersey california claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a primary insurance book of business 
based upon our experience  the majority of claims on primary mortgage insurance loans occur in the third through seventh years after loan origination  and relatively few claims are paid during the first two years after loan origination 
primary insurance written from the period from january  through december  represented of our primary insurance in force as of december  this portion of our loan portfolio is in its expected peak claim period with respect to traditional primary loans 
we believe our a minus and sub prime loans will have earlier incidences of default than our prime loans 
a minus loans represented and of our primary risk in force as of december  and  respectively  and sub prime loans represented and of our primary risk in force as of december  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the dispersion of our primary insurance in force and risk in force as of december   by year of policy origination and average annual mortgage interest rate since we began operations in dollar amounts in millions average rate primary insurance in force percent of total primary risk in force percent of total policy year and prior total portfolio primary mortgage insurance claims paid  including loss adjustment expenses  or lae  for the year ended december  were million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pool insurance claims paid were million for each of the years ended december   and the frequency of defaults may not correlate directly with the number of claims received because the rate at which defaults are cured is influenced by borrowers financial resources and circumstances and regional economic differences 
whether an uncured default leads to a claim principally depends upon the borrower s 
table of contents equity at the time of default and the borrower s or the insured s ability to sell the home for an amount sufficient to satisfy all amounts due under the mortgage loan 
when we receive notice of a default  we use a proprietary model to determine whether a delinquent loan is a candidate for work out 
when the model identifies such a candidate  our loan workout specialists prioritize cases for loss mitigation based upon the likelihood that the loan will result in a claim 
loss mitigation actions include loan modification  extension of credit to bring a loan current  foreclosure forbearance  pre foreclosure sale  and deed in lieu 
these loss mitigation efforts often are an effective way to reduce our claim exposure and ultimate payouts 
our policies require the insured to file a claim with us  specifying the claim amount unpaid principal  interest and expenses  no later than days after it has acquired title to the underlying property  usually through foreclosure 
the claim amount is subject to our review and possible adjustment 
depending upon the applicable state foreclosure law  an average of approximately months elapse from the date of default to the filing of a claim on an uncured default 
our master policies exclude coverage where there is physical damage whether caused by fire  earthquake or other catastrophe  unless the property is restored to its condition at the time the insurance was placed  with reasonable wear and tear excepted 
we have the right to rescind coverage and refuse to pay a claim if it is determined that the insured or its agents misrepresented material information in the insurance application 
in addition  where loans are underwritten by lenders through our delegated underwriting program  we have the right to rescind coverage if the loan was not underwritten in compliance with our approved guidelines 
within days after a claim and supporting documentation have been filed  we have the option to pay the claim amount  multiplied by coverage percentage specified in the certificate of insurance  in the event the property is sold pursuant to an agreement made prior to payment of the claim  which we refer to as a pre arranged sale  to pay the lesser of of the claim amount less the proceeds of sale of the property  or the claim amount multiplied by the coverage percentage  or to pay the lender an amount equal to the unpaid loan principal  delinquent interest and certain expenses incurred with the default and foreclosure  and acquire title to the property 
we bear the risk of any loss in connection with the acquisition and sale of the property 
for the year ended december   we settled approximately of the primary insurance claims processed for payment on the basis of a pre arranged sale 
the ratio of the claim paid to the current risk in force for a loan is referred to as claim severity 
the current aggregate risk in force is equal to the unpaid principal amount multiplied by the coverage percentage 
the main determinants of claim severity are the age of the mortgage loan  the value of the underlying property  accrued interest on the loan  expenses advanced by the insured and foreclosure expenses 
these amounts depend partly upon the time required to complete foreclosure  which varies depending upon state laws 
pre foreclosure sales  acquisitions and other early workout efforts help to reduce overall claim severity 
our average primary mortgage insurance claim severity was  and for the years  and  respectively 
competition we compete primarily with us and state government agencies  other private mortgage insurers  mortgage lenders and other investors  the gses and  potentially  the federal home loan banks 
we also compete  indirectly  with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate credit risk 
us and state government agencies 
we and other private mortgage insurers compete for flow business directly with us federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the fha and  to a lesser degree  the va 
in the aggregate  the fha and va had a market share in and a market share in  according to information published by inside mortgage finance 

table of contents loans insured by the fha cannot exceed maximum principal amounts that are determined by a percentage of the conforming loan limit 
for  the maximum fha loan amount for homes with one dwelling unit in high cost areas is  and the maximum va loan amount is  we and other private mortgage insurers are not limited as to maximum individual loan amounts we can insure 
in addition to competition from the fha and the va  we and other private mortgage insurers face competition from state supported mortgage insurance funds in several states  including california  illinois and new york 
from time to time  other state legislatures and agencies consider expansions of the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages 
government entities with which we compete typically do not have the same capital requirements and do not have the same profit objectives as we do 
although private companies establish pricing terms for their products to achieve targeted returns  these government entities may offer products on terms designed to accomplish social or political objectives or reflect other non economic goals 
private mortgage insurers 
the private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive 
the private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of seven mortgage insurers plus our company 
mortgage lenders and other investors 
we and other mortgage insurers compete with transactions structured by mortgage lenders to avoid mortgage insurance on low down payment mortgage loans 
these transactions include self insuring and simultaneous second loans  which separate a mortgage with a loan to value ratio of more than  which generally would require mortgage insurance  into two loans  a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio of and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan 
simultaneous second loans are also often known as loans  because they often comprise a first mortgage with an loan to value ratio  a second mortgage with a loan to value ratio and the remaining paid in cash by the buyer  rather than a single mortgage with a loan to value ratio 
however  simultaneous seconds also can be structured as loans or loans  as well as other configurations 
over the past several years  we believe the volume of simultaneous second loans as an alternative to loans requiring private mortgage insurance has increased substantially 
we believe this recent increase reflects the following factors the lower cost of simultaneous second loans compared to the cost of mortgage insurance  due to the current low interest rate environment and the emerging popularity of and year amortizing and adjustable rate simultaneous seconds  the fact that second mortgage interest is generally tax deductible  whereas mortgage insurance payments currently are not tax deductible although from time to time there have been proposed legislative initiatives to permit deductions for mortgage insurance payments  negative consumer  broker and realtor perceptions of private mortgage insurance  and the desire by some investors to hold second mortgages 
we are developing mortgage insurance products that seek to enhance the appeal of private mortgage insurance in view of the increasing volume of simultaneous second loans 
for example  in  we launched our homeopeners suite of products designed to compete more effectively with simultaneous second loans by offering consumers lower monthly payments  more deductible interest and involuntary job loss protection at no additional cost 
mortgage lenders also may compete with mortgage insurers as a result of legislation that has removed restrictions on affiliations between banks and insurers 
the graham leach bliley act of permits the combination of banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company 
this legislation may increase competition by increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
in addition  mortgage lenders that establish or affiliate with competing mortgage insurers may reduce their purchases of our products 

table of contents we also compete with structured transactions in the capital markets and with other financial instruments designed to mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults  such as credit default swaps and credit linked notes  with lenders who forego mortgage insurance self insure on loans held in their portfolios  and with mortgage lenders who maintain captive mortgage insurance and reinsurance programs 
the gses fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loans banks 
as the predominant purchasers of conventional mortgage loans in the us  fannie mae and freddie mac provide a direct link between mortgage origination and capital markets 
as discussed above under primary mortgage insurance  most high loan to value mortgages purchased by fannie mae or freddie mac are insured with private mortgage insurance issued by an insurer deemed qualified by the gses 
our mortgage insurance company is a qualified insurer with both gses 
private mortgage insurers may be subject to competition from fannie mae and freddie mac to the extent the gses are compensated for assuming default risk that would otherwise be insured by the private mortgage insurance industry 
the gses are currently subject to oversight by the department of housing and urban development  or hud 
in november  hud announced new gse mortgage purchase requirements  known as affordable housing goals 
under these goals  which became effective january   the minimum percent of all loans purchased by the gses that must support low and moderate income home buyers increases annually from in to in  and the minimum percent of such loans that must be on properties in underserved areas increases annually from in to in the gses goals to expand purchases of affordable housing loans may increase the size of the mortgage insurance market 
the gses also have expanded programs to include commitments to purchase certain volumes of loans with loan to value ratios greater than 
private mortgage insurers must satisfy requirements set by the gses to be eligible to insure loans sold to the gses  and the gses have the ability to implement new eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers 
they also have the authority to change the pricing arrangements for purchasing retained participation mortgages as compared to insured mortgages  increase or reduce required mortgage insurance coverage percentages  and alter or liberalize underwriting standards on low down payment mortgages they purchase 
in addition to the gses  the federal home loan banks  or fhlbs  purchase single family conforming mortgage loans 
although not required to do so  the fhlbs currently use mortgage insurance on substantially all mortgage loans with a loan to value ratio above 
international mortgage insurance we have significant mortgage insurance operations in australia and canada  two of the largest markets for mortgage insurance products outside the us  as well as smaller operations in new zealand and the developing markets in europe  mexico and japan 
the net premiums written in our international mortgage insurance business have increased by a compound annual growth rate of for the three years ended december  insurance in force for our international mortgage insurance business contributed of our total insurance in force as of december  compared to as of december  and as of december  in addition  earnings from our international mortgage insurance business represented  and of our mortgage insurance net earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing a compound annual growth rate of from to the mortgage loan markets in the us  canada  australia and new zealand are well developed 
although mortgage insurance plays an important role in each of these markets  the markets vary significantly and are influenced in large part by the different cultural  economic and regulatory conditions in each market 
we believe the following factors have contributed to the growth of robust mortgage insurance demand in these countries a desire by lenders to offer low down payment mortgage loans to facilitate the expansion of their business  
table of contents the recognition of the higher default risk inherent in low down payment lending and the need for specialized underwriting expertise to conduct this business prudently  government housing policies that support increased homeownership  government policies that support the use of securitization and secondary market mortgage sales  in which third party credit enhancement is often used  as a source of funding and liquidity for mortgage lending  and bank regulatory capital policies that provide incentives to lenders to transfer some or all of the increased credit risk on low down payment mortgages to third parties  such as mortgage insurers 
we believe a number of these factors are becoming evident in certain markets throughout europe  latin america and asia and provide opportunities for us to expand our mortgage insurance business in those markets 
based upon our experience in the mature markets  we believe a favorable regulatory framework is important to the development of an environment in which lenders routinely extend high loan to value loans and use products such as mortgage insurance to protect against default risk or obtain capital relief 
as a result  we have advocated governmental and policymaking agencies throughout our markets adopt legislative and regulatory policies supporting increased homeownership and capital relief for lenders and mortgage investors that insure their loan portfolios with private mortgage insurance 
although the products we offer in each of our international markets differ  they represent substantially similar risk propositions and involve similar business practices 
we have developed significant expertise in mature markets  and we leverage this experience in developing markets as we continue to encourage regulatory authorities to implement incentives for private mortgage insurance as an effective risk management strategy 
we believe the revisions to a set of regulatory rules and procedures governing global bank capital standards that were introduced by the basel committee of the bank for international settlements  known as basel ii  also may encourage further growth of international mortgage insurance 
basel ii has been designed to reward banks that have developed effective risk management systems by allowing them to hold less capital than banks with less effective systems 
for example  basel ii may reward a lender that transfers some risk of mortgage default to a third party insurer by reducing the amount of capital that the lender must hold to back a mortgage 
basel ii was finalized and issued in june  however  its adoption by individual countries is ongoing 
therefore  we cannot predict the benefits that ultimately will be provided to lenders  or how any such benefits may affect the opportunities for the growth of mortgage insurance 
under proposed rules released by the australian prudential regulation authority apra during in connection with the basel ii framework  certain approved deposit taking institutions adis in australia would be required to hold less capital on high loan to value mortgage loans and would also receive a capital incentive for using mortgage insurance  but at a reduced level when compared to current regulations in australia 
apra has also proposed that adis would need to acquire mortgage insurance coverage levels lower than existing requirements in order to obtain these reduced capital incentives 
we continue to work with apra on this proposed rulemaking  which is expected to become effective january  if the final rules retain these provisions  lenders in australia may be able to reduce their use of mortgage insurance for high loan to value ratio mortgages  which may have an adverse affect on our australian business 
certain markets in europe  latin america and asia have strong demand for housing  but are underserved by the existing housing finance systems 
as a result  we believe that mortgage insurance could enhance the overall scale  effectiveness and efficiency of these mortgage markets 
we expect lenders in these countries will seek to expand their consumer mortgage loan portfolios  while maintaining strong risk and capital management routines 
with the expected implementation of the new basel ii standards  we believe we will be well positioned to assist lenders in these markets in meeting those goals and in complying with the anticipated complexity of the risk based capital and operating standards 

table of contents canada we entered the canadian mortgage insurance market in with our acquisition of certain assets and employees from the mortgage insurance corporation of canada  and we now operate in every province and territory 
we are currently the only private mortgage insurer in the canadian market  although other companies have recently applied for a license to sell mortgage insurance in canada 
products we offer two products in canada primary flow insurance and portfolio credit enhancement insurance 
our principal product is primary flow insurance  which is similar to the primary flow insurance we offer in the us regulations in canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks  trust companies and insurers  where the loan to value ratio exceeds 
mortgage insurance in canada is typically single premium and provides coverage  in contrast to the us  where monthly premiums and lower coverage levels are typical 
under the single premium plan  lenders usually include the single premium as a part of the aggregate loan amount and pay a single premium to us as the mortgage insurer 
we  in turn  record the proceeds to unearned premium reserves  invest those proceeds and recognize the premiums over time in accordance with the expected expiration of risk 
we also provide portfolio credit enhancement insurance to lenders that have originated loans with loan to value ratios of less than 
these policies provide lenders with immediate capital relief from applicable bank regulatory capital requirements and facilitate the securitization of mortgages in the canadian market 
in both primary flow insurance and portfolio policies  our mortgage insurance in canada provides insurance coverage for the entire unpaid loan balance  including interest  selling costs and expenses  following the sale of the underlying property 
the leading mortgage product in the canadian market is a mortgage with the interest rate fixed for the first five years of the loan 
after the fifth year  the loan becomes due and payable and the borrower must negotiate its renewal  at which time the borrower may choose to have the interest rate float or have it fixed for an additional period 
lenders typically charge a mortgage pre payment penalty that serves as a disincentive for borrowers to refinance their mortgages 
changes in interest rates  adverse economic conditions and high levels of borrowing affect the frequency of defaults and claims with respect to these loans  which may adversely affect our loss experience 
regulations in canada require the use of mortgage insurance for all mortgage loans extended by banks  trust  companies and insurers with loan to value ratios greater than 
in february  as part of a periodic review of the federal financial services regulatory framework  the canadian department of finance issued a consultation document seeking comment on a wide variety of potential initiatives relating to the regulation of financial services  including whether to remove the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance on all loans with loan to value ratios greater than 
the removal of the statutory requirement for mortgage insurance  in whole or in part  may result in a reduction in the amount of business we write in future years in canada 
see regulation mortgage insurance international regulation canada 
government guarantee we have an agreement with the canadian government under which it guarantees the benefits payable under a mortgage insurance policy  less of the original principal amount of an insured loan  in the event that we fail to make claim payments with respect to that loan because of insolvency 
we pay the canadian government a risk premium for this guarantee and make other payments to a reserve fund in respect of the government s obligation 
because banks are not required to maintain regulatory capital on an asset backed by a sovereign guarantee  our sovereign guarantee permits lenders purchasing our mortgage insurance to reduce their regulatory capital charges for credit risks on mortgages by 

table of contents customers the nine largest mortgage originators in canada  consisting of banks  trust companies  and credit unions  collectively provide more than of the financing for canada s residential mortgage financing 
the nine largest originators in each of the past three years provided us with  and of our new insurance written for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other market participants include regional banks  trust companies  and credit unions 
competitors currently  the only other mortgage insurance competitor in canada is the canada mortgage and housing corporation  or cmhc  which is a crown corporation owned by the canadian government 
because cmhc is a government owned entity  its mortgage insurance provides lenders with capital relief from bank regulatory requirements 
we compete with cmhc primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service  quick decision making on insurance applications  strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development 
in april  the cmhc announced a rate reduction for loans with a loan to value ratio exceeding  which we have matched 
rate reductions or other actions taken by the cmhc to reduce rates or compete with us in other ways may cause our revenue in our canadian mortgage insurance business to decline 
in addition  as in other markets  we compete in canada with alternative products and financial structures  such as credit default swaps  which are designed to transfer credit default risk on mortgage loans 
australia and new zealand we entered the australian mortgage insurance market in with our acquisition of the operating assets of the housing loans insurance corporation  or hlic  from the australian government 
we entered the new zealand mortgage insurance market in as an expansion of our australian operations 
products in australia and new zealand  we offer primary flow insurance  known as lenders mortgage insurance  or lmi  and portfolio credit enhancement policies 
our principal product is lmi  which is similar to the primary flow insurance we offer in canada  with single premiums and coverage 
lenders usually collect the single premium from prospective borrowers at the time the loan proceeds are advanced and remit the amount to us as the mortgage insurer 
we in turn record the proceeds to unearned premium reserves  invest those proceeds and recognize the premiums over time in accordance with the expected expiration of risk 
we provide lmi on a flow basis to two types of customers banks  building societies and credit unions  and non bank mortgage originators  called mortgage managers 
banks  building societies and credit unions generally acquire lmi only for residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios above 
under apra requirements  effective january   reduced capital requirements apply to high loan to value residential mortgages only if they have been insured by a mortgage insurance company that is regulated by apra or is subject to comparable regulation in its home jurisdiction and is otherwise acceptable to apra 
after october   non standard loans with a loan to value ratio above are entitled to a reduced capital requirement only if they meet strict requirements as established by apra or are insured by a qualified lmi 
apra s regulations currently require apra regulated lenders to determine the criteria for determining if a loan is a non standard type loan 
our insurance subsidiary that serves the australian and new zealand markets has financial strength ratings of aa very strong from s p and fitch and a rating of aa excellent from moody s 
the aa rating is the third highest of s p s ratings categories and the third highest of fitch s ratings categories 
the aa rating is the third highest of moody s ratings categories 
mortgage managers fund their operations primarily through the issuance of mortgage backed securities 
because they are not regulated by apra  they do not have the same capital incentives as banks for acquiring 
table of contents lmi 
however  they use lmi as the principal form of credit enhancement for these securities and generally purchase insurance for every loan they originate  without regard to the loan to value ratio 
we also provide portfolio credit enhancement policies to apra regulated lenders that have originated loans for securitization in the australian market 
portfolio mortgage insurance serves as an important source of credit enhancement for the australian securitization market  and our portfolio credit enhancement coverage generally is purchased for low loan to value  seasoned loans written by apra regulated institutions 
to date  a market for these portfolio credit enhancement policies has not developed in new zealand to the same extent as in australia 
in both primary lmi and portfolio credit enhancement policies  our mortgage insurance provides insurance coverage for the entire unpaid loan balance  including selling costs and expenses  following the sale of the security property 
most of the loans we insure in australia and new zealand are variable rate mortgages with loan terms of between and years 
in connection with our acquisition of the operating assets of hlic in  we agreed to service a mortgage insurance portfolio that was retained by the australian government 
we receive a small amount of management fees for handling claims and providing loss mitigation and related services  but we did not acquire hlic s originated insurance policies and do not bear any risk on those policies 
customers the ten largest mortgage originators in australia  consisting of banks and mortgage managers  collectively provide more than of australia s and new zealand s residential mortgage financing 
the ten largest originators in each of the past three years provided us with of our new insurance written for the year ended december   and for and other market participants in australian and new zealand mortgage lending include regional banks  building societies and credit unions 
competitors the australian and new zealand flow mortgage insurance markets currently are served by one other independent lmi company  as well as various lender affiliated captive mortgage insurance companies 
we compete primarily based upon our reputation for high quality customer service  quick decision making on insurance applications  strong underwriting expertise and flexibility in terms of product development 
as in canada  our products also compete in australia and new zealand with alternative products and financial structures that are designed to transfer credit default risk on mortgage loans 
we believe other us mortgage insurance providers are considering opportunities in australia 
apra s license conditions require australian mortgage insurance companies  including ours  to be mono line insurers  which are insurance companies that offer just one type of insurance product 
europe we began our european operations in the uk  which is europe s largest market for mortgage loan originations 
we expanded into six additional countries and we continue to explore opportunities in other european countries 
mortgage insurance originating in the uk accounted for approximately of our european mortgage insurance in force as of december  as compared to as of december  this large concentration in the uk is attributable primarily to the fact that we have been operating in that country considerably longer than in any other european country 
our growth in other european countries has helped to diversify our risk 
products our european business currently consists principally of primary flow insurance on adjustable rate mortgages 
as is the case in our other non us markets  most primary flow insurance policies written in europe 
table of contents are structured with single premium payments 
our primary flow insurance generally provides first loss coverage in the event of default on a portion typically of the balance of an individual mortgage loan 
we believe that  over time  there is an opportunity to provide additional products with higher coverage percentages to reduce the risks to lenders of low down payment lending to levels similar to those in more mature mortgage insurance markets 
we also recently began offering portfolio credit enhancement policies to lenders that have originated loans for securitization in select european markets 
customers as a result of our strategy to expand organically into new markets in europe with attractive growth potential  we have diversified our risk among seven countries  thereby reducing our historical concentration in the uk our portfolio of international mortgage insurance in force in europe is concentrated in the countries where we have been active for the longest period of time and with customers with whom we have been doing business for the longest period of time 
we expect this concentration to diminish over time 
our customers are primarily banks and mortgage investors  and our largest customer in europe represented of our new insurance written for the year ended december  competitors our european business faces competition from both traditional mortgage insurance companies as well as providers of alternative credit enhancement products 
our competitors are both public and private entities 
public mortgage guarantee facilities exist in a number of countries  which may compete with our products 
we also face competition from some of our us private mortgage competitors as well as multi line insurers primarily in the uk and the republic of ireland 
we also face competition from alternative credit enhancement products  such as personal guarantees on high loan to value loans  second mortgages and bank guarantees  and captive insurance companies organized by lenders 
lenders also have sought other forms of risk transfer  such as the use of capital market solutions through credit derivatives 
in addition  some european lenders have chosen to price for and retain the additional credit risk  effectively self insuring their low down payment loans 
we believe that our global expertise  coverage flexibility  and strong ratings provide a very valuable offering compared with competitors and alternative products 
loan portfolio the following table sets forth selected financial information regarding the effective risk in force of our international mortgage insurance loan portfolio as of the dates indicated december  dollar amounts in millions loan to value ratio and above to to and below total loan type fixed rate mortgage adjustable rate mortgage total mortgage term years and under more than years total for loan type in this table  any loan with an interest rate that is fixed for an initial term of five years or less is categorized as an adjustable rate mortgage 

table of contents our businesses in australia  new zealand and canada currently provide coverage on the majority of the loans we insure in those markets 
the table above presents effective risk in force  which recognizes the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property 
effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor that represents our highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of our businesses in australia  new zealand and canada 
as of december   this factor was

viking is a bermuda based reinsurer primarily of leased equipment insurance and consumer credit insurance underwritten by american bankers insurance company  or abic 
ge commercial finance  formerly known as vendor financial services  purchased property and casualty insurance from abic on behalf of certain of its lessees to cover leased equipment 
abic then reinsured those policies with viking 
ge consumer finance  formerly card services  develops and markets credit insurance through credit card issuers  retailers and banks 
these credit insurance policies also are underwritten by abic and then reinsured with viking 
ge commercial finance ceased purchasing new insurance coverage on behalf of lessees through abic  as of march   and ge consumer finance intends to phase out marketing credit insurance over the next several years 
ge capital has agreed to take all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the relevant existing insurance and reinsurance relationships  but we expect viking s reinsurance programs with ge consumer finance and ge commercial finance to decline steadily over the next several years and  ultimately  be discontinued 
with respect to ge consumer finances credit insurance  ge capital may decide to encourage a switch of existing coverages to another program 
in that event  ge capital has agreed to pay viking an amount equal to the net underwriting income viking is projected to receive as reinsurer from the date of discontinuation of any credit insurance program through december
