prior to january   our partnership had no combined operations 
in these circumstances  we are required to present  discuss and analyze the financial condition and results of operations of dorchester hugoton  the accounting acquiror  for the one month period ended january  and the financial condition and results of operations for our partnership for the eleven month period ended december  information for the years ended december  and are exclusively our partnership 
for the purposes of this presentation  the term combination means the transactions consummated in connection with the combination of the business and properties of dorchester hugoton  republic and spinnaker 
critical accounting policies we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all such costs are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  dorchester hugoton was deemed to be the accounting acquiror of the republic and spinnaker assets 
our partnership s acquisition of these assets was recorded at a value based on the closing price of dorchester hugoton s common units immediately prior to consummation of the combination transaction  subject to certain adjustments 
consequently  the acquisition of these assets was recorded at values that exceed the historical book value of these assets prior to consummation of the combination transaction 
our partnership did not assign any book or market value to unproved properties  including non producing royalty  mineral and leasehold interests 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter 
for  our unamortized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling test 
as a result  in  our partnership recorded full cost write downs of  no additional impairments have been recorded since the quarter ended september  the discounted present value of our proved oil and gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires many subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering and geological analyses 
different reserve engineers may reach different conclusions as to estimated quantities of natural gas or crude oil reserves based on the same information 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding reserve estimates  and revisions are made to prior estimates based on updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
significant downward revisions could result in an impairment representing a non cash charge to earnings 
in addition to the impact on calculation of the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a major component of the calculation of depletion 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of our reserves are objectively determined 
the ceiling test calculation requires use of prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the accounting period  which are generally held constant for the life of the properties 
as a result  the present value is not necessarily an indication of the fair value of the reserves 
oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and the prevailing prices at any given time may not reflect our partnership s or the industry s forecast of future prices 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for example  estimates of uncollected revenues and unpaid expenses from royalties and net profits interests in properties operated by non affiliated entities are particularly subjective due to inability to gain accurate and timely information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates

our portion of oil and gas sales volumes and weighted average sales prices are shown in the following table

liquidity and capital resources capital resources our primary sources of capital are our cash flow from the net profits interests and the royalty properties 
our only cash requirements are the distributions to our unitholders  the payment of oil and gas production and property taxes not otherwise deducted from gross production revenues and general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf and allocated in accordance with our partnership agreement 
since the distributions to our unitholders are  by definition  determined after the payment of all expenses actually paid by us  the only cash requirements that may create liquidity concerns for us are the payments of expenses 
since most of these

we are not directly liable for the payment of any exploration  development or production costs

expenses and capital expenditures the operating partnership does not currently anticipate drilling additional wells as a working interest owner in the fort riley zone or the council grove formations or elsewhere in the oklahoma properties previously owned by dorchester hugoton 
successful activities by others in these formations or other developments currently underway could prompt a reevaluation of this position 
any such drilling is estimated to cost  to  per well 
the operating partnership anticipates continuing additional fracture treating in the oklahoma properties previously owned by dorchester hugoton but is unable to predict the cost as a specific engineering study is required for each fracture treatment 
three fracture treatments in those properties were conducted in and cost between  and  per well 
the wells did not require casing repairs 
the increases in production ranged from mcfd to mcfd 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
the operating partnership owns and operates the wells  pipelines and gas compression and dehydration facilities located in kansas and oklahoma previously owned by dorchester hugoton 
the operating partnership anticipates gradual increases in expenses as repairs to these facilities become more frequent  and anticipates gradual increases in field operating expenses as reservoir pressure declines 
the operating partnership does not anticipate incurring significant expense to replace these facilities at this time 
these capital and operating costs are reflected in the net profits interests payments we receive from the operating partnership 
in  oklahoma regulations removed production quantity restrictions in the guymon hugoton field  and did not address efforts by third parties to persuade oklahoma to permit infill drilling in the guymon hugoton field 
both infill drilling and removal of production limits could require considerable capital expenditures 
the outcome and the cost of such activities are unpredictable 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
no additional compression affecting the wells formerly owned by dorchester hugoton has been installed since by operators on adjoining acreage 
the operating partnership believes it now has sufficient field compression and permits for vacuum operation to remain competitive with adjoining operators for the foreseeable future

in general  the limited partners are allocated of the net profits interest receipts and of the royalty properties net receipts 
net profits interests we receive monthly payments from the operating partnership equal to of the net proceeds actually realized by the operating partnership from the properties underlying the net profits interests 
the operating partnership retains the balance of these net proceeds 
net proceeds generally reflect gross proceeds attributable to oil and natural gas production actually received during the month less production costs actually paid during the same month 
production costs generally reflect drilling  completion  operating and general and administrative costs and exclude depletion  amortization and other non cash costs 
the operating partnership made net profits interests payments to us totaling  during october through september  which payments reflected of total net proceeds of  realized from september through august net proceeds realized by the operating partnership during september through november were reflected in net profits interests payments made during october through december these payments were included in the fourth quarter distribution paid in early and are excluded from this analysis 
royalty properties revenues from the royalty properties are typically paid to us with proportionate severance production taxes deducted and remitted by others 
additionally  we generally pay ad valorem taxes  general and administrative costs  and marketing and associated costs since royalties and lease bonuses generally do not otherwise bear operating or similar costs 
after deduction of the above described costs including cash reserves  our net cash receipts from the royalty properties during the period october through september were   of which was distributed to the limited partners and  of which was distributed to the general partner

due to these fixed percentages  our general partner does not have any incentive distribution rights or other right or arrangement which will increase its percentage share of net cash generated by our activities or those of the operating partnership 
during the period october through september  our partnership s quarterly distribution payments to limited partners were based on all of its available cash 
our partnership s only significant cash reserves that influenced quarterly payments were  for ad valorem taxes 
additionally  certain production costs under the net profits interests calculation and a small portion of management expense reimbursements include amounts for which funds were set aside monthly to enable payment when due 
examples are pension contributions and payroll taxes 
these amounts generally are not held for periods over one year 
fourth quarter distribution indicated price in an effort to provide the reader with information concerning prices of oil and gas sales that correspond to our quarterly distributions  management calculates the weighted average price by dividing gross revenues received by the net volumes of the corresponding product without regard to the timing of the production to which such sales may be attributable 
this indicated price does not necessarily reflect the contractual terms for such sales and may be affected by transportation costs  location differentials  and quality and gravity adjustments 
while the relationship between the partnership s cash receipts and the timing of the production of oil and gas may be described generally  actual cash receipts may be materially impacted by purchasers release of suspended funds and by prior period adjustments 
cash receipts attributable to the partnership s net profits interests during the fourth quarter totaled  these receipts generally reflect oil and gas sales from the properties underlying the net profits interests during august through october the weighted average indicated prices for oil and gas sales during the fourth quarter attributable to the net profits interests were bbl and mcf  respectively 
cash receipts attributable to the partnership s royalty properties during the fourth quarter totaled  these receipts generally reflect oil sales during september through november and gas sales during august through october the weighted average indicated prices for oil and gas sales during the fourth quarter attributable to the royalty properties were bbl and mcf  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information provides quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
market risk related to oil and natural gas prices essentially all of our assets and sources of income are from the net profits interests and the royalty properties  which generally entitle us to receive a share of the proceeds from oil and natural gas production on those properties 
consequently  we are subject to market risk from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
we do not anticipate entering into financial hedging activities intended to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
absence of interest rate and currency exchange rate risk we do not anticipate having a credit facility or incurring any debt  other than trade debt 
therefore  we do not expect interest rate risk to be material to us 
we do not anticipate engaging in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose us to foreign currency related market risk
