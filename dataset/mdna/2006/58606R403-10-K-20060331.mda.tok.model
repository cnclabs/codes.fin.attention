item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview since our incorporation in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of innovative drug candidates for the treatment of a broad range of cns conditions  many of which exhibit significant impairment of memory and other cognitive functions 
these conditions include neurological diseases associated with aging  such as alzheimer s disease  and also include certain psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  and depression 
we currently have a number of clinical and preclinical drug candidates in development  as well as other drug discovery programs  addressing specific cns targets 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale and do not anticipate having any commercial products for sale within the foreseeable future 
we seek to leverage our pipeline of early development candidates through collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we have entered into two separate collaborations with roche for clinical development  one for pde inhibitors and the other for nicotinic alpha agonists 
as of december   we had received million in upfront licensing fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and an equity investment under these collaborations 
under our roche agreement  roche provided us with research and development funding  initially for a two year period  which was extended in august for an additional two years 
in february  in connection with an amendment to the roche agreement  we further amended the roche agreement to terminate roche s obligation to make research and development funding payments in support of the pde research collaboration 
in august  we amended the roche agreement to reacquire the right to develop and commercialize mem and mem  the two named drug candidates under that agreement  following roche s earlier decision not to pursue further clinical development of these candidates 
we have evaluated the data that we received from roche and are currently exploring the potential for a new collaboration for mem and mem any further development of mem and mem will be funded largely through such a collaboration 
in february  we amended and restated our original roche agreement 
under the terms of the amended and restated roche agreement  we have granted to roche a worldwide  exclusive  sublicensable license to all of our patent rights and know how with respect to our nicotinic alpha agonists  other than mem  for the prevention and treatment of diseases  in all indications  for either human or veterinary use 
with respect to mem  roche has the option to obtain a license following our completion of the phase a clinical trial for this candidate 
roche maintains this license option by paying pre specified license rights maintenance fees to us 
we will receive an aggregate of million of research and development funding in subject to the determination by the parties that certain specified preclinical criteria have been achieved  we will be eligible to receive an aggregate of approximately million in research and development funding in on may   we announced that we had received a million milestone payment from roche related to mem  a drug candidate being developed under our amended and restated roche agreement 
roche elected to make this first milestone payment in order to maintain its option to obtain an exclusive license for mem the payment was triggered by our preclinical work on mem  which satisfied a set of criteria that was pre defined by roche  and the initiation of a phase clinical trial for mem in february on october   we entered into the amgen agreement for the development of pde inhibitors for neurological and psychiatric disorders 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million up front fee in november and are receiving research and developing funding as well 
under the terms of the amgen agreement  amgen is obligated to make milestone payments to us if we achieve pre specified research  development  regulatory approval and sales milestones for certain pde inhibitors to be developed under the agreement 
in addition  we are eligible to receive royalties that will increase with increasing sales levels on worldwide sales of marketed products from the collaboration 
on december   we entered into a development agreement with smri  pursuant to which we plan to conduct a phase bipolar disorder clinical trial of mem under the terms of the development agreement  we are eligible to receive up to million in funding from smri to support the development of mem for the treatment of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia over the development term of three years  which term may be extended for additional one year periods 
we received  of this funding in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share that becomes exercisable on june  and expires on december  we are eligible to receive the remaining million as milestone payments upon our achievement of certain milestones related to the phase a trial in bipolar disorder  which we currently plan to commence in the first half of if we fail to achieve the third milestone by december   then we will be required to refund to smri the portion of the million of development funding advanced by smri as of that date 
on september   we completed a private placement in which we issued  shares of common stock  at a price of per share  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we refer to this as our september private placement 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  of which million related to preferred stock dividends that were forfeited upon the conversion of our redeemable convertible preferred stock upon the closing of our initial public offering on april  these losses and accumulated deficit have resulted from the significant costs incurred in the research and development of our compounds and technologies  including payroll and payroll related costs  manufacturing costs of preclinical and clinical grade materials  facility and facility related costs  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and general and administrative costs 
we expect that our losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to support our research  development and clinical trial activities to support our drug discovery and development programs 
under our june agreement with bayer for the in license of mem  we had paid million in upfront and milestone payments as of december  we are required to make additional payments to bayer of up to million in the event that we achieve specified milestones and to pay royalties on sales of any products incorporating mem because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and clinical milestones  and potentially  from entering into new collaborations  our revenue may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
our operating expenses may also vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter based on the timing and level of our preclinical and clinical activities performed directly by us versus by our collaboration partners 
we have funded our mem program in alzheimer s disease on our own and  as part of that program  are currently funding a multi center phase a clinical trial for mem  while continuing to explore the potential for a collaboration for this drug candidate 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in entering into a collaboration for mem on favorable terms  if at all 
if  following the completion of a phase a trial  we have been unable to find a collaboration partner for mem  we may  at that time  choose to continue the development of mem at our own expense 
if we do so  our requirements for capital will substantially increase 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful because of the range of factors that could affect our results from one year or quarter to the next and should not be relied on as indicative of our future performance 
revenue to date  our revenue has been derived from our collaborations with roche and amgen 
any additional revenue that we may receive in the future is expected to consist primarily of upfront license fees  milestone payments  research and development funding and royalty payments from either roche  amgen  or from other collaborations that we enter into 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and clinical milestones  and potentially  from entering into new collaborations  our revenue may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to contract research organizations and consultants in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials  including for services such as the independent monitoring of our clinical trials and the evaluation of data from our clinical trials  costs of materials used in research and development  upfront and milestone payments under our in licensing agreement  consulting  license and sponsored university based research fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of capital assets used to develop our drug candidates 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our drug candidates 
we do not have the ability to conduct all of the preclinical testing of our compounds or clinical trials of drug candidates on our own 
in addition to our collaborators  we rely and will continue to rely on clinical investigators  third party contract research organizations and consultants to perform some or all of the functions associated with preclinical testing or clinical trials 
the failure of any vendor to perform in an acceptable and timely manner in the future  or in accordance with any fda regulations  could cause a delay or other material adverse effect on our preclinical testing  clinical trials and ultimately on the timely advancement of our development programs 
if we or our collaborators cannot locate acceptable contractors to conduct a portion of our or our collaborators clinical trials or enter into favorable agreements with them  or if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties  satisfy fda and other us and foreign legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical testing and clinical trials or meet expected deadlines  our preclinical or clinical development programs and those of our collaborators could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected 
to illustrate the material nature of our reliance on third party clinical research organizations  the following table shows  from inception through december   the total out of pocket payments made by us to third parties for clinical supplies  preclinical study support and clinical trials associated with our five compounds currently in preclinical and clinical development 
the table excludes internal costs for each of the drug candidates and out of pocket payments made by our collaboration partners 
inception to stage of year ended december  december  drug candidate mechanism target indication development in thousands mem neuronal l type calcium channel modulator alzheimer s disease bipolar disorder phase a phase a ready      mem nicotinic alpha partial agonist schizophrenia and or alzheimer s disease phase a ready    mem pde inhibitor alzheimer s disease phase completed mem pde inhibitor alzheimer s disease preclinical completed mem nicotinic alpha partial agonist alzheimer s disease preclinical total we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test compounds in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we then conduct early stage clinical trials for each drug candidate 
if we are not able to engage a collaboration partner prior to the commencement of later stage clinical trials  we may fund these trials ourselves 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials by us or our collaborators may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a drug candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others the number of sites included in the trials  the cost associated with recruiting patients  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  and the efficacy and safety profile of the drug candidates 
none of our drug candidates has received fda or foreign regulatory marketing approval 
in order to achieve marketing approval  the fda or foreign regulatory agencies must conclude that our and our collaborators clinical data establishes the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaborations with roche and amgen 
in the event that third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a drug candidate  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plan for those drug candidates or our capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  and to what extent  we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving executive  business development  finance  accounting  information technology  administrative and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not included in research and development expense  depreciation  insurance  professional fees for legal and accounting services  and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we do not currently have any commercial products for sale and do not anticipate having any commercial products for sale within the foreseeable future 
to date  our revenue has been derived from our collaborations with roche and amgen 
any additional revenue that we may receive in the future is expected to consist primarily of upfront license fees  milestone payments  research and development funding and royalty payments from either roche  amgen or from other collaborations we enter into 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  representing the currently recognizable portion of upfront license fees  milestone payments  and research and development funding from our collaboration agreements with roche and amgen 
this represented a increase from revenue of million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to revenue from our amgen agreement 
december  in thousands roche agreement amortization of the upfront license payment and milestone payments funding of the research collaboration amended and restated roche agreement amortization of the upfront payment and quarterly research payments amgen agreement amortization of the upfront license payment and milestone payments funding of the research collaboration research and development expense research and development expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to million of increased spending relating to the clinical trials for mem and mem  a million non cash compensation charge associated with the modification of a former executive officer s stock option agreements  and the million milestone payment to bayer upon the commencement of the phase a ad clinical trial for mem  offset by reduced spending of  on external research support and  on lab materials and supplies 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and include an allocation of indirect costs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  indirect costs principally represent facility and information technology related costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of million in increased costs related to legal and patent fees for the maintenance and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio  and other costs associated with being a public company  such as board of director fees  investor relations and public relations costs  accounting and auditing fees  and increased director and officer insurance premiums 
these increases were offset by a reduction in non cash compensation costs of million related to a reduction in grants of stock options to consultants 
unrealized loss on warrants in connection with our september private placement  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of   shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the warrants have been recorded as a liability and valued at fair value on the date of issuance 
for the year ended december   as a result of an increase in the fair market value of our common stock since the date of the issuance of the warrants  we recognized an unrealized loss of million in accordance with eitf no 
refer to note  september private placement 
interest income and interest expense interest income increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from the year ended december  interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from the year ended december  the increase in interest income was attributable to higher investment balances and higher interest rates during the decrease in interest expense was related to the repayment in of equipment notes 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized a tax benefit of  which represented proceeds received for the sale of million of state net operating loss carryforwards  offset by  in state taxes and other adjustments 
our tax benefit of  represented proceeds received for the sale of million of state net operating loss carryforwards  offset by  in state taxes and other adjustments 
preferred stock dividends and accretion there were no preferred stock dividends and accretion for the year ended december  as compared to million for preferred stock dividends and accretion for the same period in this change was attributable to the conversion of our preferred stock in connection with our initial public offering in april upon the closing of our initial public offering on april   all of our preferred stock converted into common stock  and all related accrued dividends were forfeited 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  was million  representing the currently recognizable portion of upfront license fees  milestone payments  and research and development funding under our and roche agreements 
this represented a increase from revenue of million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to revenue from our roche agreement 
research and development expense research and development expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to fees related to our increased use of consulting and outside service providers in connection with our preclinical and clinical activities  and million was attributable to an increase in occupancy costs associated with our expanded facility 
in general  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we increase the number of drug candidates and indications for which we conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
research and development costs include an allocation of indirect costs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  indirect costs principally represent facility and information technology costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of  in higher personnel and personnel related costs as we hired personnel appropriate for a public company  an increase of  for insurance premiums  an increase in occupancy costs of  related to our expanded facility   in legal fees relating to the maintenance and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio  and  of cost associated with our k matching benefit to employees that began in these increases were offset by a decrease in non cash compensation expense of million related to the grant of stock options to consultants and employees in more stock options were granted at current market prices in relative to stock options granted in therefore  we recognized less non cash compensation expense in interest income and interest expense interest income increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from the year ended december  interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from the year ended december  the increase in interest income was attributable to higher investment balances  due to our receipt of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in april the decrease in interest expense was related to the repayment in of two equipment notes 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized a tax benefit of  which represented the proceeds received for the sale of million of state net operating loss carryforwards and was offset by  in state taxes and other adjustments 
our tax benefit of  represented proceeds of  received during for the sale of million of state net operating loss carryforwards  and was offset by a  provision for minimum taxes for new jersey 
preferred stock dividends and accretion preferred stock dividends and accretion decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the conversion of our preferred stock in connection with our initial public offering in april upon the closing of our initial public offering on april   all of our preferred stock converted into common stock  and all related accrued dividends were forfeited 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through the sale of equity securities  payments received under our collaboration and development agreements  equipment financings and interest income 
from inception through december   we have raised net proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities 
in addition  as of december   we have received million in upfront and milestone payments  million in research and development funding  million from equipment financings  million from the reimbursement of external research costs and million in interest income 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as compared to million at december  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are highly liquid investments and consist of term deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  corporate debt securities  mortgage backed securities and government obligations 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  this primarily reflects the net loss of million and working capital uses of million offset by an unrealized loss on warrants of million  an increase of million of deferred revenue  a non cash charge for depreciation expense of million  a non cash stock based compensation charge of million for the modification to vested stock options granted to a former executive officer  and a million charge for other employee stock based compensation costs 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  which represents a decrease in our net investment in marketable securities of million  offset by funds used for capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million which consisted of million of proceeds primarily from the issuance of common stock and warrants in our private placement and million of borrowings to finance equipment purchases  offset by million used in the repayment of equipment notes 
the following table summarizes as of december   our contractual obligations for operating lease payments in connection with the lease of our current facility  equipment notes and contract research organization obligations 
this table should be read in conjunction with the notes accompanying our financial statements 
payments due in contractual obligations total in thousands operating lease payments equipment notes payable contract research organization obligations total the contract research organization obligations in the above table represent firm commitments to utilize the services of certain service providers in conjunction with the planning  design and implementation of our clinical trials for mem and mem in we expect to incur increased contract research organization costs as we increase the number of drug candidates and indications for which we conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials beyond however  as of december   we did not have any contractual obligations beyond december  in addition  the nature of the work being conducted under our agreements with contract research organizations is such that work may be stopped with very short notice 
in such event  we will not be liable for the full amount of the contract 
our contractual obligations may vary depending upon the results of underlying studies  the completion of preclinical work and or clinical trials and certain other variables that may yield a result that differs from our estimate 
in connection with our in license agreement with bayer for mem  we are required to make additional payments of up to million to bayer upon our achievement of specified milestones and to pay royalties to bayer upon sales of any products incorporating mem the other amounts due to bayer have not been included in the above table as a result of the uncertainty of when  if ever  these milestones will be achieved 
we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development expenses  including expenses related to additional preclinical testing and clinical trials 
we are funding or contemplating funding the development of several of our drug candidates and programs 
our most significant commitment currently is to mem  for which we are funding a multi center phase a clinical trial in alzheimer s disease 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities  together with payments required to be made by our collaboration partners will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  repayment of equipment notes and capital equipment requirements through the first quarter of our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the number of compounds and drug candidates that we advance through the development process  the funding we receive from our collaborations  whether we are able to enter into a collaboration with regard to mem  and the terms of any such collaboration  the scope and results of our and our collaborators clinical trials  potential in licensing or acquisition of other compounds or technologies  the costs involved in utilizing third party contract research organizations for preclinical studies and clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the availability of third parties  and the cost  to manufacture compounds for clinical trial supply  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  and the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution 
currently we have no committed sources of capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital by selling equity or by incurring additional indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
additionally  any future equity funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  research and development and the fair value of our equity securities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue relating to our collaborations in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues under such collaborations may include the receipt of non refundable license fees  milestone payments and research and development funding 
deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance of revenue recognition under such collaborations 
given the various types of payments to us under our collaboration agreements  we must evaluate these agreements to determine units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
under the terms of our roche agreement  because we have licensed to roche certain intellectual property and we have continuing performance obligations  we are recognizing the non refundable upfront license fees and performance milestone payments as revenue ratably over the period in which we expect to obtain fda approval of the first compound to be developed under the collaboration 
as a result of roche s decision  in april  not to pursue the further development of the two named drug candidates under our pde inhibitor collaboration  mem and its back up mem  we have reassessed the expected period for the development of the first compound under the roche agreement 
solely for purposes of revenue recognition under our roche agreement  we have estimated the period until approval by the fda of the first compound under that collaboration as ending in the second quarter of we apply the provisions of eitf no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  prospectively to the original roche agreement using a single unit of accounting  since under that agreement  roche had the right to enter into a license 
as of december   revenue under the original roche agreement was recognized over the five year period that roche had to obtain a sub licensable license to our patent rights and know how for any nicotinic alpha agonist that we developed 
revenue was being recognized over this period based on the level of effort expended in a period as compared to our estimated effort over the full five year period 
milestone payments and research and development funding received under the original roche agreement were recognized prospectively over the remaining term of the agreement based on level of effort 
on february   we amended and restated the roche agreement to grant to roche a worldwide  exclusive  sublicensable license to all of our patent rights and know how with respect to our nicotinic alpha agonists  other than mem with respect to mem  roche continues to have the option to obtain a license to mem following our completion of the phase a clinical trial for this drug candidate 
we are currently evaluating the prospective impact of the terms of the amended and restated roche agreement on revenue recognition  including the period over which revenue will be recognized under the amended agreement 
in accordance with eitf no 
 under the terms of our amgen agreement  we are recognizing the non refundable upfront license fee and performance milestone payments as revenue ratably over the two year term of the agreement 
we will recognize revenue over the two year term based on the level of effort expended in a period as compared to our estimated efforts over the full period 
we periodically review the estimated development periods for our compounds and our estimated research efforts and  to the extent such estimates change  the impact of such change is recorded prospectively 
payments received from our collaboration partners for research and development funding that are deemed to be a separate unit of accounting  as defined by eitf no 
 are recognized as such research and development services are performed 
otherwise  the payments are recognized over the term of the applicable collaboration agreement or drug candidate s estimated approval period 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
this is done as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include professional service fees  such as attorneys and accountants fees  preclinical and clinical contract research organization fees  fees to be paid to data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees to be paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of the clinical supply of our drug candidates 
in connection with the above services  our estimates are most affected by our projections of the timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services performed by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could materially differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us gaap 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to contract research organizations and consultants in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials  including for services such as the independent monitoring of our clinical trials and the evaluation of data from our clinical trials  costs of materials used in research and development  upfront and milestone payments under our in licensing agreement  consulting  license and sponsored university based research fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of capital assets used to develop our drug candidates 
stock based compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based employee compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in the notes to our financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure  and related pronouncements 
we account for stock options and warrants granted to non employees based on the fair value of the stock option or warrant using the black scholes option pricing model based on assumptions for expected stock price volatility  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield at the grant date 
prior to april   our common stock was not publicly traded 
as a result  in valuing our common stock  stock options and warrants issued prior to that date  we considered the pricing of private equity sales  company specific events  independent valuations  economic trends and the rights and preferences of the security being valued 
since our initial public offering  the fair value of stock based compensation has been based on the price of our common stock on the measurement date 
recently issued accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas revised statement  share based payment  sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based awards to employees  including those made under employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation to employees in their statements of operations 
the effective date of sfas r for us is january  because we currently account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with apb opinion no 
 which does not require expensing compensation cost in our statement of operations  the adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements beginning in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
our current policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market funds  government obligations  mortgage backed securities  and corporate debt securities  directly or through managed funds 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
there has been no material change to our market risk since december
