item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see risk factors under item a of this report regarding certain factors known to us that could affect our future operating results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in as of march   we have grown to restaurants  including company operated and five franchise locations 
we also license our concept for three non traditional locations at petco park in san diego  the san diego international airport and the arrowhead pond of anaheim 
we position our restaurants in the high quality  fresh  distinctive and affordable fast casual mexican cuisine segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become a leading brand in this industry segment 
during  we continued to focus on ways to improve our economic model and enhance the overall experience of guests in our restaurants 
to increase revenues  we expanded our fresh and affordable menu in early  introduced some new products such as the mesquite shrimp taco and continued to work on initiatives that improve speed of service  cleanliness and our restaurant appearance 
we initiated a system wide re imaging program  under which we re imaged restaurants in our average unit volume increased from  to  due to an increase in comparable store sales of and the closure of one underperforming unit 
on the cost and expense side of our economic model  we saw an improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales and managed to keep our labor costs the same percentage of restaurant sales as a year ago 
increases in unit operating expenses  primarily in advertising  utilities  delivery fees and credit card fees  contributed to a decline in our restaurant operating margins 
we opened five new restaurants includes one replacement restaurant in and plan to open to new restaurants in  with an annual growth rate of to per year for the next three to five years 
general and administrative costs increased significantly in we added head count to allow us to execute our development plans as well as to better support our restaurants through hiring  developing and training our new team members 
we also experienced large operating expenses outside of our normal restaurant operations support in legal and professional fees for previous years consolidated financial statement restatements  sox documentation and on going litigation defense amounted to million for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of  an additional million was recorded related to executive separation of  severance and  revaluation of stock options  legal fees and lobster lawsuit settlement costs of  other legal and professional fees of  executive search and relocation expenses of  and other miscellaneous expenses of

index to financial statements we also recorded charges for closing our only restaurant in oregon during the fourth quarter of the store closure accrual was increased by  to represent the expected shortfall between rents and other costs owed versus amounts received from a proposed sub lease for the remainder of our lease 
in addition  loss on disposal of property was  due to the company s re imaging program  assets disposed of with the store closure as well as abandoned projects including the elimination of margarita machine from certain of our restaurants 
our balance sheet remains strong 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments at december  were million and we have no outstanding debt 
we believe we are positioned well for our future restaurant development plans and have the corporate infrastructure in place to continue to support existing and new restaurants in and future years 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those relating to impairment of assets  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current information available  and actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us asset impairment and store closure expense reversal we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when a restaurant experiences a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or a store closure 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual restaurants that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets at each restaurant  we recognize an impairment loss to reduce the assets carrying amounts to their estimated fair value for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of based on the discounted projected cash flows derived from the restaurant 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis are those used to estimate a restaurant s future cash flows 
we use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on restaurant specific information 
if the significant assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating restaurant assets  as well as the related impairment charge  may be overstated or understated 
we estimate that it takes a new restaurant approximately months to reach operating efficiency 
any restaurant open months or less  therefore  is not included in the analysis of long lived asset impairment  unless other events or circumstances arise 
we make decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
we record losses associated with the closure of a restaurant at the time the unit is closed 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
the amount of our store closure liability  and related store closure charges  may decrease if we are successful in either terminating a lease early or obtaining a more favorable sublease  and may increase if any of our sublessees default on their leases 
asset impairment and store closure expense are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to our restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because the factors used to estimate impairment and store closure expense are subject to change  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
property property is stated at cost 
a variety of costs are incurred in the leasing and construction of restaurant facilities 
the costs of buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include development costs  construction costs  salaries and related costs  and other costs incurred during the acquisition or construction stage 
salaries and related costs capitalized totaled   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization of buildings  leasehold improvements  and equipment are computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the initial lease term for certain leased properties buildings and improvements range from to years  and equipment to years 
for leases with renewal periods at the company s option  the company generally uses the original lease term  excluding renewal option periods to determine useful lives  if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the company  management may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives 
the company s policy requires lease term consistency when calculating the depreciation period  in classifying the lease  and in computing straight line rent expense

index to financial statements self insurance liabilities we are self insured for a portion of our workers compensation insurance program 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence was  during each of our claim years ended october  and we account for insurance liabilities based on independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss incurred 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of industry wide historical claim loss development 
our actual loss development may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the accrual  and our operating expenses will increase or decrease accordingly 
consistent with trends the restaurant industry has experienced in recent years  particularly in california where claim loss trends are among the highest in the country  workers compensation liability premiums continue to increase 
revenue recognition revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
franchise revenue is comprised of i area development fees  ii new store opening fees  and iii royalties 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements under individual franchise agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis as the individual franchised restaurants subject to the development agreements are opened 
new store opening fees are recognized as revenue in the month a franchised location opens 
royalties from franchised restaurants are recorded in revenue as earned 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between fiscal   and refer to the week periods ended december   december   and december  the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  with respect to certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations

index to financial statements the following table summarizes the number of restaurants december  december  december  company operated franchised total revenues total revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted from several factors first  our four new store openings fiscal contributed sales of million  second  stores opened before fiscal but not yet in our comparable store base contributed sales of million  and third  increased comparable store sales of contributed million 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease of million in sales from the one store that closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in comparable stores sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a increase in the number of transactions  combined with a increase in the average check amount 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily due to sales of million from our four store openings and two replacement store openings in fiscal  million in sales generated by a full twelve months of operations from units opened in fiscal that were not yet in our comparable store base  and an increase in comparable store sales of for million 
this increase was offset by a decrease of million in sales from the four stores that closed in fiscal the increase in comparable stores sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a increase in the average check amount  along with a increase in the number of transactions 
costs and expenses cost of sales increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in the number of company operated restaurants 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of sales decreased to in fiscal  as compared with in fiscal and in the percentage improvement in fiscal as compared with fiscal is a direct result of operational efficiencies and a decrease in the cost of chicken 
during the majority of fiscal  we experienced higher food and paper costs associated with our larger portions  more menu variety  expanded salsa bar and upgraded packaging for our brand repositioning  combined with a strong discount promotion during the second quarter of that year 
in addition  our new menu variety resulted in an anticipated shift in our product mix from lower priced fish menu items to higher priced chicken and steak menu items 
in an effort to reduce these costs  during the last quarter of fiscal  we selected several new vendors  renegotiated contracts with existing vendors  and switched to less expensive packaging  in addition to implementing a modest price increase 
restaurant labor costs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to in fiscal and fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of our ability to leverage our costs with the increase in our revenue  combined with lower workers compensation expenses 
restaurant occupancy and other costs increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal this increase in fiscal from is primarily the result of increased advertising  higher credit card processing  delivery fees due to higher usage as a percentage of restaurant sales  utilities  non recurring expenses in common area maintenance and property taxes 
unit operating expenses were higher in fiscal than in fiscal as we incurred higher training  supply  repair and uniform costs associated with our brand repositioning 
in addition  occupancy costs as a percentage of sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in the average unit volumes 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  these costs were in fiscal and in both fiscal and fiscal we added head count to allow us to execute our development plans as well as to better support our restaurants through hiring  developing and training our new team members 
we also experienced large operating expenses outside of our normal restaurant operations support in legal and professional fees for previous years consolidated financial statement restatements  sox documentation and on going litigation defense amounted to million for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of  an additional million was recorded related to executive separation of  severance and  revaluation of stock options  legal fees and lobster lawsuit settlement costs of  other legal and professional fees of  executive search and relocation expenses of  and other miscellaneous expenses of

index to financial statements depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new restaurants added in and as well as with the restaurant re imaging program 
pre opening expenses decreased to million in fiscal  from million in and million in fiscal during fiscal  we opened five restaurants compared to six during fiscal and nine during fiscal costs were higher in fiscal primarily due to two factors 
first  four of the restaurants opened in fiscal were located further away from our home base  causing our training team to incur higher travel costs 
second  costs were incurred during fiscal for two units that opened during costs were lower in fiscal due in part to the fact that one of the restaurants opened in fiscal was a replacement unit  and  as such  training costs were minimal 
asset impairment and store closure expense reversal was comprised of a  charge in fiscal  as compared to a  net reversal in fiscal  and compared with a charge of million  net  during fiscal the  charge during fiscal was the net effect of a charge to impairment of  for the closure of the portland  oregon restaurant  combined with a reversal to store closure of  based on the recalculation of the closed store accrual for a phoenix  arizona restaurant 
the  reversal in fiscal was the net effect of a  increase to reflect additional expenses incurred to find a suitable sublessee  combined with a  reversal to reflect additional sublease income received 
the million charged during fiscal was the net result of a million charge for asset impairment and a million net reduction in our store closure accrual 
the million charge related to the impairment of sixteen under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
of these locations  five were outside california and four had been previously partially impaired in fiscal all of the associated restaurants are expected to remain open through the end of their lease terms  generally from to the assets impaired at these under performing locations consisted of leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment 
fair value of the leasehold improvements was determined based on discounted cash flows and the lower of the net book value or an estimate of current liquidation value for fixtures and equipment 
the three factors that led to the impairment charge were the lower than anticipated increases in comparative store sales  higher than anticipated operating costs associated with our system wide brand repositioning program  and escalating workers compensation costs 
other income expense  net increased to income of  in fiscal  compared to income of  in fiscal and expense of  in fiscal interest income increased as our investments rose from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal and due to increased interest rates and a full year benefit of the larger investment balance 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal   and is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income 
during fiscal  we reduced our fiscal projected annual rate due to our tax planning initiatives 
the tax benefit applied to fiscal comprises the federal and state statutory rate benefit  increased by additional benefit for federal and california targeted employment tax credits  tax exempt interest and for prior year california targeted employment tax credits and alternative minimum tax credits benefited during the tax rate applied to fiscal consisted of the federal and state statutory rates adjusted for benefits associated with federal employment tax credits and tax exempt interest 
the tax benefit applied to fiscal primarily comprises the federal and state statutory rates 
seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease  utility  labor and insurance costs 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor  and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our guests 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to insurance and utility expenses has had a material impact on our results of operations in  and

index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources since we became public in  we have funded our capital requirements through bank debt and cash flows from operations 
we generated million in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  offset by million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures and million in purchases of investments  partially offset by million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and net cash used of million 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal and consisted of proceeds received from exercises of common stock options 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal consisted of million payment on a line of credit and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of million 
on october   the company obtained a letter of credit in the amount of million related to the company s workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit is subject to automatic extension for one year from the expiration date and thereafter  unless notification is made prior to the expiration date 
the letter of credit was extended in october and again in october on december   this letter of credit was increased to million 
the company was also required  under the terms of both letters of credit  to pledge collateral of million in  and million in we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million for restaurant openings  restaurant re imaging  maintenance  and for corporate and information technology 
we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant  including approximately  in rent holiday expenses 
we believe that the anticipated cash flows from operations combined with our cash and short term investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases

index to financial statements impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  inventory costs 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facilities expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we expect the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin during fiscal no conditional asset retirement obligations were recognized and  accordingly  the adoption of fin had no effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after december  and requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
we expect the adoption of this staff position will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and generally requires the cost associated with employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments be measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r also provides guidance on how to determine the grant date fair value for awards of equity instruments as well as alternative methods of adopting its requirements 
sfas no 
r is effective for the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period after june  as disclosed above  based on the current assumptions and calculations used  had we recognized compensation expense based on the fair value of awards of equity instruments  net earnings would have been reduced by approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments primarily with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
as of december   we had no investments with maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of investment and debt instruments the company has  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a significant negative effect on our financial results 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of less than one year 
we do not believe that these purchase commitments are material to our operations as a whole 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources
