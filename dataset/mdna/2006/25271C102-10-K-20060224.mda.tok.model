item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in deepwater drilling with a fleet of offshore drilling rigs 
our fleet currently consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and one drillship 
in august  we purchased the ocean monarch formerly the enserch garden banks  a victory class semisubmersible drilling rig and related equipment  for million and removed from service one of our jack up rigs  the ocean warwick  as a result of damages it sustained during hurricane katrina 
see overview impact of hurricanes 
in june  we completed the sale of the ocean liberator and received net cash proceeds of million 
overview industry conditions the steadily rising demand for our mid water intermediate and deepwater high specification semisubmersible rigs that characterized the first nine months of continued during the fourth quarter of the year  while the market for our jack up fleet reflected particular strength 
supported by solid fundamental market conditions for all classes of offshore drilling rigs  dayrates have in many cases more than doubled previous cycle peaks  and our customers are increasingly seeking longer term contracts 
as a result  we increased our revenue backlog from approximately million  or rig years  at the beginning of to a current backlog of approximately billion  or rig years  as of early february generally rig utilization rates approach during contracted periods  however  utilization rates can be adversely impacted by additional downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  unscheduled repairs  maintenance and weather 
gulf of mexico 
in the gom  dayrates continue to escalate 
a contract for one of our high specification rigs has reached as high as  per day for work beginning in the first quarter of and extending until the first quarter of this contrasts with a dayrate of  that the unit is currently earning 
six of our seven high specification semisubmersible rigs in the gom  including the recently relocated ocean baroness  have future contracts or a letter of intent  or loi  at dayrates at least percent higher than the average dayrate these rigs earned during the first quarter of an loi is subject to customary conditions  including the execution of a definitive agreement  and actual revenues received could be reduced by various operating factors  including utilization rates 
the dayrates for our five intermediate semisubmersibles currently operating in the gom have reached as high as  for a one well contract beginning in the third quarter of this contrasts with an average dayrate in the low  range earned during the first quarter of by our intermediate drilling units in the gom 
we continue to view the deepwater and intermediate markets in the gom as under supplied and believe that additional improvements in backlog and dayrates are possible in these market segments during our jack up fleet in the gom also continued to experience high utilization and improving dayrates during the fourth quarter of  compared to the first nine months of dayrates for our jack up fleet operating in the gom have reached as high as  for a two well contract beginning late in the first quarter of this contrasts with an average dayrate in the low  range earned by our jack up rigs in the gom during the first quarter of industry wide  we believe that nine jack up units were lost due to hurricanes in and  and we expect up to six additional jack up units to leave the gom for other international markets by mid among the six jack up rigs that are expected to leave the gom is the ocean spur 
we expect to mobilize the rig from the gom to tunisia in the first quarter of  where the unit has a commitment at a dayrate of  for a period of months beginning in mid march 
we view the jack up market in the gom as under supplied and believe that additional improvement in backlog and dayrates is possible in this market segment during in the mexican sector of the gulf of mexico  or mexican gom  our four intermediate semisubmersible rigs remain under long term contracts that extend into late and we view the market for the mexican gom as firm and expect it to remain so during 
table of contents brazil 
two of our rigs operating in brazil are currently working under term contracts that expire in and two additional rigs are operating under contracts expiring in we do not currently contemplate any change in our market position in brazil 
we view the brazilian semisubmersible market as firm and expect it to remain so during north sea 
drilling activity in both the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea has mirrored that in the gom since mid our three intermediate semisubmersible rigs in the uk sector are operating under one to two year term contracts at dayrates ranging from  to  for work that is now underway 
additionally  one of these three rigs  the ocean nomad  has received an month contract extension beginning in the first quarter of at a dayrate of  in norway  the ocean vanguard is working under a  per day contract that expires early in the fourth quarter of  followed by options priced at  per day that expire in the first quarter of effective industry utilization remains near percent in the north sea  and current dayrates exceed our present and future contract rates in both the uk and norwegian sectors 
we believe this market will continue to improve during australia asia middle east mediterranean 
we currently have five semisubmersible rigs and one jack up rig operating in the australia asia  or australasian  market 
these rigs are operating under contracts or commitments for work extending well into  and in some instances or  at increasing dayrates  compared to dayrates averaging in the low  range at the end of a commitment for one of our intermediate rigs in the sector has reached as high as  per day for one well beginning in the second quarter of this contrasts with a dayrate of  that the unit is currently earning 
with the relocation of the ocean heritage from southeast asia to qatar in the second quarter of and the expected mobilization of the ocean spur to the mediterranean in the first quarter of  we are continuing to strategically redeploy our fleet in response to rising market demand and dayrates 
we believe that the australasian and middle east mediterranean markets will continue to improve during impact of hurricanes in the third quarter of  two major hurricanes  katrina and rita  struck the us gulf coast and gom 
in late august  one of our jack up drilling rigs  the ocean warwick  was seriously damaged during hurricane katrina and other rigs in our fleet sustained lesser damage in hurricanes katrina or rita  or in some cases from both storms 
we believe that the physical damage to our rigs  as well as related removal and recovery costs  are covered by insurance  after applicable deductibles 
our results for reflect the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the ocean warwick  with a net book value of million  was declared a constructive total loss effective august  we issued a proof of loss in the amount of million to our insurers  representing the insured value of the rig less a million deductible  and received all insurance proceeds related to this insurance claim in recovery and removal of the ocean warwick are subject to separate insurance deductibles totaling million 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million  pre tax  net casualty gain million  after tax  or per share of common stock on a diluted basis on the ocean warwick  representing net insurance proceeds of million  less the write off of the million net carrying value of the drilling rig and million in rig based inventory  and million in insurance deductibles for salvage and wreck removal as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
we have presented this as casualty gain on ocean warwick in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
damage to our other affected rigs and warehouse in new iberia  louisiana was less severe  and we believe that repair costs for such damage and lost equipment will be covered by insurance  less estimated deductibles 
all of our damaged rigs have now been repaired and returned to service 
insurance deductibles relating to the remaining rigs damaged during hurricane katrina and our rigs and facility damaged by hurricane rita total million in the aggregate  of which million and million have been recorded as additional contract drilling expense and loss on disposition of assets  respectively  for the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we wrote off the net book value of approximately million  pre tax  in rig equipment that was either lost or damaged beyond repair during these storms as loss on disposition of assets 
table of contents and recorded a corresponding insurance receivable in an amount equal to our expected recovery from insurers 
the write off of this equipment and recognition of insurance receivables had no net effect on our consolidated results of operations in during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred additional operating expenses  including but not limited to the cost of rig crew over time and employee assistance  hurricane relief supplies  temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment  of million  pre tax  relating to relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita  which we do not expect to be recoverable through our insurance 
general revenues 
our revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days our drilling fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned by our rigs 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
the two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is ultimately a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we previously accounted for the excess of mobilization fees received over costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another as revenue over the term of the related drilling contracts 
effective july  we changed our accounting to defer mobilization fees received as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred and began to amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
we believe that the straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
if we had used this method of accounting in prior periods  our operating income loss and net income loss would not have changed and the impact on our contract drilling revenues and expenses would have been immaterial 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs 
we defer such fees received in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report and recognize these fees into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and 
table of contents take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey and require downtime for the drilling rig  but normally do not require dry docking or shipyard time 
during  we expect to spend an aggregate of million for year and intermediate surveys  excluding mobilization costs and any resulting repair and maintenance costs 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
our management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
the offshore drilling industry is a relatively young industry which began developing just over years ago 
we have based our estimates of useful lives and salvage values on the historical industry data available to us  as well as our own experience 
in april  we commissioned a study to evaluate the economic lives of our drilling rigs because several of our rigs had reached or were approaching the end of their depreciable lives  yet were still operating and were expected to operate for many more years 
as a result of this study  effective april   we recorded changes in accounting estimates by increasing the estimated service lives to years for our jack ups and years for our semisubmersibles and drillship and by increasing salvage values to for most of our drilling rigs 
we made the change in estimates to better reflect the remaining economic lives and salvage values of our fleet 
the effect of this change in accounting estimates resulted in an increase in our net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share  and a reduction of our net loss for the years ended december  and of  million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked  and salvage value for each rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
we also consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for 
table of contents the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant  or alternatively the impact of a reduction in utilization again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant as part of our analysis 
at december   we reviewed our single cold stacked rig  the ocean monarch  for impairment 
based on our recent decision to upgrade this drilling unit to high specification capabilities at an estimated cost of approximately million and the low net book value of this rig  we do not consider this asset to be impaired 
in december  we reviewed our three cold stacked rigs for impairment and determined that none of the drilling units was impaired 
on january   we announced that we would upgrade one of our cold stacked rigs  the ocean endeavor  to a high specification drilling unit for an estimated cost of approximately million 
as a result of this decision and the low net book value of this rig  we did not consider this asset to be impaired 
we were marketing another of our cold stacked rigs  the ocean liberator  for sale to a third party in  and we classified the rig as an asset held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets at december  included in item of this report 
the estimated market value of this rig  based on offers from third parties  was higher than its current carrying value  therefore  no write down was deemed necessary as a result of the reclassification to an asset held for sale 
we sold the ocean liberator in the second quarter of for a net gain of million 
we evaluated our then remaining cold stacked rig for impairment using the probability weighted cash flow analysis discussed above 
at december   the probability weighted cash flow for the ocean new era significantly exceeded its net carrying value of million 
we reactivated the ocean new era from cold stacked status in the fourth quarter of and it began operating under contract in the gom in december at december  we determined that all five of our cold stacked rigs should be tested for impairment 
the impairment analysis at december  consisted of a probability weighted cash flow analysis for each of the five cold stacked rigs 
in all cases  the probability weighted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value of each rig 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
our uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims  which primarily results from jones act liability in the gom  is million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of million 
our in house claims department estimates the amount of our liability for our retention 
this department establishes a reserve for each of our personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim and comparing the circumstances of each claim to our historical experiences with similar past personal injury claims 
our claims department also estimates our liability for claims which are incurred but not reported by using historical data 
historically  our ultimate liability for personal injury claims has not differed materially from our recorded estimates 
at december  our estimated liability for personal injury claims was million 
the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from the estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced 
table of contents by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
for interim periods  we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax  taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
at the end of we had established a valuation allowance of million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in at december   we had million of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
during  we were able to utilize most of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income generated during the year 
as a result  we now expect to be able to utilize million of our available foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration dates and we believe that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary for those credits 
consequently  we reversed million of the previously established valuation allowance during with respect to the remaining million of foreign tax credit carryforwards  we believe that a valuation allowance is necessary and as a result have a valuation allowance of million at december  
table of contents results of operations years ended december  and comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below

revenues for our high specification rigs in the gom increased million  primarily due to higher average dayrates earned million and higher utilization of our fleet in this market million in  as compared to the higher overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters reflected the continuing high demand for this class of rig in the gom 
average dayrates for these rigs increased to  in compared to  in fleet utilization for our high specification rigs in the gom increased to in from in higher utilization in compared to the prior year reflects the return to drilling operations of several rigs which did not operate in due to scheduled inspections and repairs ocean confidence and ocean america and upgrade projects ocean america and the ready stacking of the ocean star for the first five months of in the late third quarter of  we relocated the ocean baroness from the australia asia market to the gom for a long term contract extending until november the ocean baroness began operating under contract in the gom in november and generated revenues of million in  which are included in the utilization factors discussed above 
operating costs during for our high specification floaters in the gom increased million over operating costs in the increase in operating costs is primarily attributable to higher labor and benefits costs related to higher utilization of our rigs and the effect of december and september wage increases 
costs in also include operating expenses for the ocean baroness in the gom  including mobilization costs from southeast asia 
increased operating costs in were partly offset by our recovery from a customer for damages sustained to one of our high specification rigs during hurricane ivan in australia asia 
revenues generated by our rigs in the australia asia region decreased million to million in  as compared to revenues of million in utilization in this region decreased from in to in  primarily due to the relocation of the ocean baroness from this market to the gom 
prior to its departure to the gom  the ocean baroness was mobilized to a shipyard in singapore in mid may for an intermediate inspection and preparation for the rig s dry tow to the gom  which resulted in additional unpaid downtime for the drilling unit as compared to the decline in utilization in  as compared to  resulted in a million reduction in revenues in average operating dayrates in this region increased from  in to  in and resulted in additional revenues of million in compared to contract drilling expenses in the region decreased million in  as compared to  primarily due to the relocation of the ocean baroness to the gom in the third quarter of the overall decline in operating costs in the region was partly offset by higher insurance costs associated with increased premiums for the policy year and additional loss of hire insurance coverage

overall utilization for our intermediate semisubmersibles in this region excluding the ocean endeavor  which was cold stacked during prior to commencing a major upgrade in  and the cold stacked ocean monarch  which we acquired in august increased to in from in the increase in utilization in  as compared to  is primarily due to the nearly full utilization of the ocean voyager in compared to  when this unit was cold stacked for most of the year  and increased utilization for the ocean concord  which was out of service for almost six months in for a year survey and maintenance projects 
additionally  we reactivated the ocean new era from cold stack status in the last half of  and this drilling unit returned to active service in late december partially offsetting the overall increase in utilization in  as compared to  was approximately four months of unpaid downtime for the ocean lexington in associated with inspections and a steel renewal project 

table of contents contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersibles operations in the gom increased million in  as compared to  primarily due to higher labor and benefits costs as a result of december and september wage increases for our rig based personnel  normal operating costs for the ocean voyager and ocean new era in and higher inspection and maintenance project costs for the ocean lexington  which was in a shipyard for inspections and a steel renewal project during these cost increases were partly offset by lower reactivation costs for the ocean new era in  as compared to costs incurred to reactivate the ocean voyager in australia asia 
our intermediate semisubmersibles working offshore australia asia generated revenues of million in compared to revenues of million in the million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in average operating dayrates to  in compared to  in  which generated million in additional revenues in our results in this region in also reflect the favorable impact of the ocean patriot operating for the majority of the year following its relocation to the region in the second half of however  excluding the ocean patriot  our average utilization for these rigs in the australia asia region decreased from in to in  primarily due to unpaid downtime for the ocean epoch which was in a shipyard for approximately days in for a scheduled year survey and associated repairs 
the net effect of changes in utilization in this region was the generation of million in additional revenues in compared to during we recognized million in lump sum mobilization fees for the ocean patriot related to its mobilization from south africa to new zealand and the bass strait  compared to million in similar fees recognized in in we also recognized million in revenue related to the extension of a contract option period for one of our rigs in this region and million in revenues for the amortization of lump sum fees received from a customer for rig modifications 
contract drilling expense for the australia asia region increased million from to  primarily due to costs associated with the ocean patriot operating offshore australia for all of  including the amortization of deferred mobilization expenses

the net effect of changes in average utilization between and was a million decrease in operating revenues in in  we also recognized million in mobilization revenue for the ocean nomad 
contract drilling expense for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating offshore europe increased million in primarily due to increased labor and related costs and shorebase support costs for our operations in norway  mostly due to norwegian pay allowances and additional personnel required to comply with norwegian regulations 
normal operating expenses for the ocean nomad increased in  as compared to  mainly due to higher labor costs associated with its operations in the uk  as compared to the prior year when this unit worked a portion of the year offshore western africa  as well as the recognition of mobilization expenses in related to the rig s relocation from western africa to the uk our operating costs in this region in included million in costs for the ocean patriot which relocated to the australia asia region in mid south america 
our intermediate semisubmersibles working in brazil generated revenues of million in compared to revenues of million in the million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to a contract extension for the ocean yatzy at a higher average dayrate than it previously earned 
average operating dayrates increased to  as compared to an average dayrate of  in  and resulted in additional revenues of million in average utilization of our rigs in this region increased from in

in late august  the ocean warwick was declared a constructive total loss by our insurers as a result of damage it sustained during hurricane katrina 
during and  this drilling rig generated million and million in revenues  respectively  which are included in the revenue variances discussed above 
see overview impact of hurricanes 
contract drilling expenses for our jack ups operating in the gom increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher labor and benefits costs for our rig based personnel as a result of december and september wage increases  higher normal operating costs in for the ocean champion compared to when the rig was being reactivated and higher operating and overhead costs for most of our jack ups in this region due to increased utilization 
australia asia middle east 
revenues for jack ups in the australasian and middle east regions were million in compared to million in the million increase in revenues in this region in is primarily attributable to revenues generated by the ocean heritage million  which worked in this region for the entire year  compared to working in this region during only the last quarter of  and an operating dayrate increase for the ocean sovereign million after its second quarter relocation within the region to indonesia 

table of contents contract drilling expense for jack ups in the australasian and middle east regions increased million to million in  as compared  primarily due to normal operating costs associated with the ocean heritage operating in the region for the entire year  and higher normal repair and maintenance  travel and shore based costs for the ocean sovereign

the ocean heritage operated offshore ecuador for almost eight months in during its contract the rig generated million in revenues  including the recognition of million in lump sum mobilization fees  and incurred operating expenses of million before returning to the australasia middle east region in the fourth quarter of other operating revenue and expenses  net 
other operating expenses  net of other revenues  were million in compared to million in the million increase in net costs in  as compared to  relates primarily to costs associated with relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the gom hurricanes  increased rig crew training costs due to higher staffing and recruiting levels in and higher costs in to repair and replace non rig specific spare equipment 
reimbursable expenses  net 
revenues related to reimbursable items  offset by the related expenditures for these items  were million and million in and  respectively 
reimbursable expenses include items that we purchase  and or services we perform  at the request of our customers 
we charge our customers for purchases and or services performed on their behalf at cost  plus a mark up where applicable 
therefore  net reimbursables fluctuate based on customer requirements  which vary 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to depreciation recorded in associated with capital additions in and the increase in depreciation expense attributable to capital additions was partially offset by lower depreciation due to the constructive total loss of the ocean warwick in the third quarter of and the transfer of the ocean liberator to assets held for sale in december general and administrative expense 
we incurred general and administrative expense of million in compared to million in the million increase in overhead costs between the periods was primarily due to higher compensation expense related to our management bonus plan  higher fees paid to our external auditors and higher engineering consulting fees 
partially offsetting these higher expenses were lower legal fees in compared to  primarily due to the settlement of litigation in december  and the capitalization of certain costs associated with the upgrade of the ocean endeavor  which commenced in gain on sale and disposition of assets 
we recognized a net gain of million on the sale and disposition of assets in compared to a net loss of million in net gains recognized in include an million gain on the june sale of the ocean liberator  million in insurance proceeds related to the involuntary conversion of certain assets damaged during hurricane ivan in and gains on the sale of used drill pipe during the period 
partially offsetting the net gain in was a million loss due to the retirement of equipment lost or damaged during hurricanes katrina and rita 
the loss on sale of assets in relates primarily to the retirement of equipment damaged during hurricane ivan 
casualty gain on ocean warwick

we earned interest income of million in compared to million in the million increase in interest income is primarily the result of the combined effect of slightly higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances in  as compared to see liquidity and capital requirements and historical cash flows 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million  or an million increase in interest cost compared to this increase was primarily attributable to interest related to our senior notes due july   or senior notes  and our senior notes due september   or senior notes  which we issued in june and august  respectively 
in addition  interest expense for included a write off of million in debt issuance costs associated with our june repurchase of approximately of our then outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures due  or zero coupon debentures 
this increase in interest cost was partially offset by lower interest expense on our zero coupon debentures as a result of our partial repurchase of the outstanding debentures in june and approximately million in interest costs which were capitalized in related to qualifying upgrade and construction projects

other income and expense other  net 
included in other  net are foreign currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses and other income and expense items  among other things  which are not attributable to our drilling operations 
the components of other  net fluctuate based on the level of activity  as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we recorded other expense  net  of million in both and effective october   we changed the functional currency of certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states to the us dollar to more appropriately reflect the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate 
prior to this date  these subsidiaries utilized the local currency of the country in which they conduct business as their functional currency 
during and  we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of million and million  respectively  including million in additional expense in as a result of our change in functional currency to the us dollar 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we accounted for foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report 
income tax expense 
our net income tax expense is a function of the mix of our domestic and international pre tax earnings  as well as the mix of earnings from the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we recognized million of tax expense on pre tax income of million for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million in certain of our rigs that operate internationally are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited  a cayman island subsidiary that we wholly own 
we do not intend to remit earnings from this subsidiary to the us and we plan to indefinitely reinvest these earnings internationally 
consequently  we provided no us taxes on earnings and recognized no us benefits on losses generated by this subsidiary during and at the end of we had established a valuation allowance of million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in at december   we had million of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
during  we were able to utilize most of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income generated during the year 
as a result  we now expect to be able to utilize million of our available foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration dates  and we believe that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary for those credits 
consequently  we reversed million of the previously established valuation allowance during with respect to the remaining million of foreign tax credit carryforwards  we 
table of contents believe that a valuation allowance is necessary and as a result have a valuation allowance of million at december  at december  we had a reserve of million million included with current taxes payable and in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the exposure related to the disallowance of goodwill deductibility associated with a acquisition 
during we concluded that the reserve was no longer necessary and eliminated the reserve  which resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
during  we settled an income tax dispute in east timor formerly part of indonesia for approximately million 
at december   our books reflected an accrued liability of million related to potential east timor and indonesian income tax liabilities covering the period through subsequent to the tax settlement  we determined that the accrual was no longer necessary and wrote off the accrued liability in the fourth quarter of during and  the internal revenue service  or irs  examined our federal income tax returns for tax years and the examination was concluded during the fourth quarter of we and the irs agreed to a limited number of adjustments for which we recorded additional income tax of million in our tax expense in included million associated with a revision to estimates in tax balance sheet accounts  a tax benefit of million related to goodwill arising from a merger  and a tax benefit of million due to the reversal of a tax liability associated with the ocean alliance lease leaseback 
on october   the american jobs creation act  or ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca includes a provision allowing a deduction of for certain foreign earnings that are repatriated 
the ajca provides us the potential opportunity to elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in based on the existing language in the ajca  subsequent guidance issued by the us treasury department  and after considering our history of foreign earnings  we did not have undistributed foreign earnings that would qualify for the deduction upon repatriation 
consequently  we did not repatriate any undistributed earnings in pursuant to the ajca

this increase also included costs associated with preparing the ocean vanguard for work in the north sea 
additionally  contract drilling expenses for our rigs working offshore the uk were negatively impacted in by the cost of additional labor benefits mandated by legislation in the region and the recognition of mobilization costs related to the relocation of the ocean nomad from the uk to gabon where the unit operated until the fourth quarter of south america 
revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible fleet operating offshore brazil decreased million during compared to  primarily due to the relocation of the ocean yorktown to the mexican gom in the third quarter of at a reduced dayrate and the renewal of our operating contract for the ocean yatzy in the latter part of at a significantly lower operating dayrate that reflected market conditions at the time 
operating costs for our intermediate semisubmersible rigs offshore brazil decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the relocation of the ocean yorktown to the mexican gom

table of contents sources of liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations  proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and our cash reserves 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments and marketable securities  representing our investment of cash available for current operations 
cash flows from operations 
we operate in an industry that has been  and we expect to continue to be  extremely competitive and highly cyclical 
the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and rig utilization rates are a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace  which is generally correlated with the price of oil and natural gas 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  a variety of political and economic factors and availability of rigs in a particular geographic region 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
for a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations  see overview industry conditions  forward looking statements and risk factors in item a of this report

liquidity and capital requirements our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
we believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments  however  we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
our ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on our results of operations  our current financial condition  current market conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and enhancements  as well as our working capital requirements

currency environments in which we have significant business operations include mexico  brazil  the uk  australia  indonesia and malaysia 
when possible  we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in us dollars 
at present  however  only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
we also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk 
a forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates 
we record currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses as other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the effect on our results of operations from these translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information included in this item a is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in item of this report 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
our long term debt  as of december  and december   is denominated in us dollars 
our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
during we invested in fixed rate australian dollar time deposits and million australian dollars equivalent to million of time deposits were included in investments and marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets at december  these time deposits matured during the first quarter of during we entered into various forward exchange contracts requiring us to purchase predetermined amounts of foreign currencies at predetermined dates 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding requiring us to purchase the equivalent of million in mexican pesos  the equivalent of million in australian dollars  the equivalent of million in british pounds sterling and the equivalent of million in brazilian reals at various times through march these forward exchange contracts were included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and the following table presents our exposure to market risk by category interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates fair value asset liability market risk december  december  in thousands interest rate marketable securities  a  a c  c long term debt  b  b foreign exchange australian dollar time deposits  d  d forward exchange contracts d  d a the fair market value of our investment in marketable securities is based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and b the fair values of our senior notes  senior notes  debentures and zero coupon debentures are based on the quoted closing market prices on december  and the fair value of our ocean alliance lease leaseback agreement is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of for december  c the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in interest rates of basis points at december  and d the calculation of estimated foreign exchange risk is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of an increase in foreign exchange rates of at december  and a decrease in foreign exchange rates of at december
