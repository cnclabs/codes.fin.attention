forward looking statements in the following pages  management presents an analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition as of december   and the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to prior periods 
in addition to this historical information  the following discussion and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations and the company s actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
without limiting the foregoing  some of the forward looking statements include management s establishment of an allowance for loan losses  and its statements regarding the adequacy of such allowance for loan losses  and management s belief that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the following critical accounting policies are based upon judgments and assumptions by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
allowance for losses on loans the balance in this account is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed asset impairment that has occurred in the company s loan portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements before losses have been confirmed resulting in a subsequent charge off or write down 
it is the company s policy to provide valuation allowances for estimated losses on loans based upon past loss experience  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions of the certain items  including o local market areas and national economic developments  o levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  o levels of and trends in recoveries of prior charge offs  o adverse situations that may affect specific borrowers ability to repay  o effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures  o credit concentrations  o experience  ability  and depth of lending management and credit administration staff  o volume and terms of loans  and o current collateral values  where appropriate 
when the collection of a loan becomes doubtful  or otherwise troubled  the company records a loan loss provision equal to the difference between the fair value of the property securing the loan and the loan s carrying value 
major loans and major lending areas are reviewed periodically to determine potential problems at an early date 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to earnings and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
the company accounts for its allowance for losses on loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
both statements require the company to evaluate the collectibility of both contractual interest and principal loan payments 
sfas no 
requires the accrual of a loss when it is probable that a loan has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
requires that impaired loans be measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an alternative  at the loans observable market price or fair value of the collateral 
a loan is defined under sfas no 
as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in applying the provisions of sfas no 
 the company considers its investment in one to four family residential loans  consumer installment loans and credit card loans to be homogeneous and therefore excluded from separate identification for evaluation of impairment 
these homogeneous loan groups are evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
with respect to the company s investment in commercial and other loans  and its evaluation of impairment thereof  management believes such loans are adequately collateralized and as a result impaired loans are carried as a practical expedient at the lower of cost or fair value 
it is the company s policy to charge off unsecured credits that are more than ninety days delinquent 
similarly  collateral dependent loans which are more than ninety days delinquent are considered to constitute more than a minimum delay in repayment and are evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
at that time 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights are accounted for pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which requires that the company recognize as separate assets  rights to service mortgage loans for others  regardless of how those servicing rights are acquired 
an institution that acquires mortgage servicing rights through either the purchase or origination of mortgage loans and sells those loans with servicing rights retained must allocate some of the cost of the loans to the mortgage servicing rights 
the mortgage servicing rights recorded by the company  calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 were segregated into pools for valuation purposes  using as pooling criteria the loan term and coupon rate 
once pooled  each grouping of loans was evaluated on a discounted earnings basis to determine the present value of future earnings that a purchaser could expect to realize from each portfolio 
earnings were projected from a variety of sources including loan servicing fees  interest earned on float  net interest earned on escrows  miscellaneous income  and costs to service the loans 
the present value of future earnings is the economic value of the pool  ie  the net realizable present value to an acquirer of the acquired servicing 
sfas no 
requires that capitalized mortgage servicing rights and capitalized excess servicing receivables be amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assessed for impairment 
impairment is measured based on fair value 
the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is influenced by market factors  including servicing volumes and market prices  as well as management s assumptions regarding mortgage prepayment speeds and interest rates 
management utilizes periodic third party valuations by qualified market professionals to evaluate the fair value of its capitalized mortgage servicing assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company has recorded goodwill and core deposit intangibles as a result of merger and acquisition activity 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the net book value of the assets acquired in a merger or acquisition 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
the evaluation involves assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
the impairment loss equals the excess of carrying value over fair value 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of long term deposit relationships and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company annually evaluates these estimated useful lives 
if the company determines that events or circumstances warrant a change in these estimated useful lives  the company will adjust the amortization of the core deposit intangibles  which could affect future amortization expense

following such review  the company pursued an aggressive course of action with respect to the loans reviewed  resulting in increased loan charge offs  increased loan loss provision  and increased non performing loan classifications over the remainder of the year
