hospital management services qhr is a leading provider of management and consulting services to acute care hospitals  providing management services to approximately hospitals as of december  qhr provides management services to independent hospitals and hospital systems under management contracts and also provides selected consulting  educational and related services 
qhr assists hospitals in improving their financial performance and the scope of their services 
most of the hospitals for which qhr performs management  consulting or support services are independent not for profit hospitals 
these hospitals are generally located in non urban areas 
approximately of these hospitals have fewer than beds 
upon entering into a management contract  qhr first assesses the operations of the hospital  including the hospital s financial management  the economic and population related factors affecting the hospital s market  physician relationships and staffing requirements 
based on the results of its assessment  qhr develops and recommends a management plan to the hospital s governing board 
to implement the management plan adopted for each hospital  qhr typically provides the hospital with personnel to serve as the hospital s chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
these qhr employees operate under the direction and control of the hospital s governing body  and the balance of the hospital staff remain employees of the hospital under the control and supervision of the hospital 
qhr s hospital based team is supported by its regional and corporate management staff 
qhr currently has regional offices located throughout the united states 
qhr s regional office staff is experienced in providing management services to hospitals of all sizes in diverse markets throughout the united states 
each regional office is responsible for the management services provided within its geographic area 
qhr s hospital management contracts generally have a term of three to five years and had a renewal rate of approximately in qhr s management contract fees are based on amounts agreed upon by qhr and the hospital s governing body  and generally are not related to the hospital s revenues or other variables 
under qhr s hospital management contracts  qhr is not responsible for hospital licensure  certificates of need  liability coverage  capital expenditures or other functions that are normally the responsibility of a hospital s governing body 
qhr offers consulting and related educational and management services to hospitals that are not part of its contract management program 
qhr s consulting services are directed at many of the operational needs of hospitals  including accounts receivable management  health information management  human resources  facility design and various operational services 
qhr also provides consulting services to large  sophisticated medical institutions that need hospital management advice for specific issues 
financial information for each of the last three years relating to triad s hospital management services is provided in note segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the hospital industry is highly competitive 
triad competes with other hospitals and healthcare providers for patients 
the competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
in some cases  competing hospitals are more established than triad s hospitals 
certain of these competing facilities  particularly in urban markets  offer services  including extensive medical research and medical education programs  which are not offered by triad s facilities 
in addition  in certain of the markets where triad operates  there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities  equipment and services that may not be available at triad s hospitals 
although some of triad s hospitals are located in geographic areas where they are currently the sole provider of general  acute care hospital services in their communities  these hospitals also face competition from other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers 
despite the fact that these competing hospitals may be as far as to miles away  patients in these markets may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals  managed care incentives or personal choice 
in addition  some of the hospitals that compete with triad are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions 
these hospitals can make capital 
table of contents 
index to financial statements expenditures without paying sales taxes  and are generally exempt from property and income taxes 
triad also faces competition from other specialized care providers  including specialty hospitals  outpatient surgery  orthopedic  oncology and diagnostic centers 
state certificate of need laws con laws  which place limitations on a hospital s ability to expand hospital services and add new equipment  also may have the effect of restricting competition 
eight states in which triad operates  alabama  alaska  mississippi  ohio  oregon  south carolina  tennessee and west virginia  have con laws 
the application process for approval of covered services  facilities  changes in operations and capital expenditures including certain acquisitions of facilities in these states is  therefore  highly competitive 
in those states which have no con laws or which set relatively high thresholds before expenditures become reviewable by state authorities  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending is more prevalent 
the number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in a hospital s competitive advantage 
physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed 
triad believes that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the quality of services it renders to patients and physicians  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital s facilities  equipment and employees 
admitting physicians may be on the medical staff of other hospitals in addition to those of triad s hospitals 
one element of triad s business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals in select markets 
the competition to acquire hospitals is significant 
triad may acquire or develop  on a selective basis  hospitals that are similar to those currently owned and operated 
however  suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms 
triad may also seek to expand through the formation of joint ventures with other providers  including not for profit healthcare providers 
another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital is management s ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services  such as managed care plans  which attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to obtain discounts from hospitals established charges 
employers and traditional health insurers are also interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers on the basis of price  market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of the medical staff and convenience 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations 
qhr also faces competitive challenges in the area of management services 
in seeking management services  hospitals have a variety of alternatives 
hospitals managed by hospital management companies represent less than of the total acute care hospitals in the united states 
most hospitals have their own management staff 
some hospitals choose to obtain management services from large  tertiary care facilities that create referral networks with smaller surrounding hospitals 
triad  and the healthcare industry as a whole  face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs  strong competition for patients and pressures by both private and government payers to control reimbursement rates 
as both private and government payers reduce the scope of what may be reimbursed and control reimbursement levels for what is covered  federal and state efforts to reform the healthcare system may further impact reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payers may require changes in triad s facilities  equipment  personnel  rates and or services in the future 
the hospital industry and triad s hospitals continue to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and average occupancy rates have historically been negatively affected by payer required pre admission authorization  utilization review  patient preference and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
admissions constraints  payer pressures and increased competition are expected to continue 
triad endeavors to meet these challenges by expanding many of its facilities to include outpatient centers  offering discounts to private payer groups  upgrading facilities and equipment and offering new programs and services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements employees and medical staff at december   triad had approximately  employees  including approximately  part time employees  as well as approximately employees providing hospital management and consulting services 
employees at three hospitals are currently represented by labor unions 
triad considers its employee relations to be good 
while triad s non union hospitals experience union organizational activity from time to time  triad does not expect such efforts to materially affect its future operations 
triad s hospitals  like most hospitals  have experienced labor costs rising faster than the general inflation rate  primarily in nursing 
there can be no assurance as to future availability and cost of qualified medical personnel 
triad s hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals 
physicians generally are not employees of triad s hospitals although there are varying levels of employed physicians in certain markets 
at december   triad employed approximately physicians 
some physicians provide services in triad s hospitals under contracts  which generally describe a term of service  provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians  require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services 
any licensed physician may apply to be admitted to the medical staff of any of triad s hospitals  but admission to the staff must be approved by the hospital s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital in accordance with established credentialing criteria 
members of the medical staffs of triad s hospitals located in areas where there are other hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with a hospital at any time 
triad periodically performs both employee and physician satisfaction surveys 
the surveys are used by management to enhance the operating performance of each hospital 
triad s ethics and compliance program it is triad s policy that its business be conducted with integrity and in compliance with applicable law 
triad has developed a corporate wide ethics and compliance program  which focuses on all areas of policy and regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement and cost reporting practices  and laboratory operations 
this ethics and compliance program is intended to assure that high standards of conduct are maintained in the operation of triad s business and that employees act in full compliance with all applicable laws  regulations and company policies and procedures 
under the ethics and compliance program  triad provides initial and periodic legal compliance and ethics training to every employee  reviews various areas of triad s operations  and develops and implements policies and procedures designed to foster compliance with the law 
triad regularly monitors its ongoing compliance efforts 
the program also includes a mechanism for employees to report  without fear of retaliation  any suspected legal or ethical violations to their supervisors or designated compliance officers in triad s hospitals  as well as a national hotline to which employees can report  on an anonymous basis if preferred  any suspected violations 
triad has also established a separate committee of the board of directors to monitor the ethics and compliance program 
on november   triad entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services the oig and agreed to maintain its compliance program in accordance with the corporate integrity agreement 
this obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities 
violations of the corporate integrity agreement could subject triad s hospitals to substantial monetary penalties 
the cost to maintain the compliance program was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
continuing compliance with the corporate integrity agreement may impose expensive and burdensome requirements on certain operations which could have a material adverse impact on triad 
the compliance measures and reporting and auditing requirements for triad s hospitals contained in the integrity agreement include continuing the duties and activities of corporate and facility compliance officers and committees and maintaining a written code of conduct and written policies and procedures  providing general training on the compliance program and the agreement and specific training for the appropriate personnel on billing  coding and cost report issues

reimbursement medicare 
under the medicare program  acute care hospitals generally receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system pps for inpatient hospital services 
specially designated children s hospitals and certain designated cancer research hospitals are currently exempt from pps and are reimbursed on a cost based system  subject to certain cost limits known as tefra limits 
under pps  fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patient s assigned diagnosis related group drg 
drgs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis 
drg rates have been established for each hospital participating in the medicare program  are based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity and are adjusted for area wage differentials but do not consider a specific hospital s costs 
drg rates are updated and re calibrated annually and have been affected by several recent federal enactments 
the index used to adjust the drg rates  known as the market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside of the healthcare industry in purchasing goods and services 
for federal fiscal years and the updates were the full market basket 
for federal fiscal year  hospitals generally will receive the full market basket which is 
outpatient services provided at general  acute care hospitals typically are reimbursed under a pps system for outpatient hospital services apcs 
apcs were updated by the full market basket for federal fiscal years and for federal fiscal year  apcs will be updated by the full market basket index which is 
therapy services rendered by hospitals to outpatients and inpatients not reimbursed under medicare are reimbursed according to the medicare physician fee schedule 
payments to pps exempt hospitals and units such as inpatient psychiatric hospital services were based upon reasonable costs  subject to a cost per discharge target 
these limits are updated annually by a market basket index 
on november   final rules were issued to convert reimbursement for pps exempt psychiatric hospitals and units to a prospective payment system 
reimbursement is based on a prospectively determined per diem for cost reporting periods beginning on or after january  the per diem rules have four tiers  the highest for the first day of the stay  a lower rate for the second through fourth day  a third tier for the fifth through eighth day  and a final tier 
the payment system is being phased in over a three year period 
also  during this period there is a stop loss provision equal to at least of the amount that would have been paid under the reasonable cost reimbursement system 
for the year ended december   less than of triad s patient revenues were derived from psychiatric services 
payments for medicare skilled nursing facility services  home health services  inpatient rehabilitation hospital services and psychiatric hospital services are made under a separate pps system for each of these services 
the updates for and were the full market basket 
for federal fiscal year  the rates will be updated by the full market basket index for skilled nursing facility services and inpatient rehabilitation hospital services 
the rate update for home health services is the market basket minus 
the rate update for psychiatric hospital services is expected to be the full market basket and would be effective july  there is also consolidated billing for skilled nursing facility services  under which payments for most non physician services for beneficiaries no longer eligible for skilled nursing facility care will be made to the facility  regardless of whether the item or service was furnished by the facility  by others under arrangement  or under any other contracting or consulting 
table of contents 
index to financial statements arrangement 
consolidated billing is being implemented on a transition basis 
as of december   of triad s hospitals operated skilled nursing facilities 
home health services are reimbursed under a pps system  although in fiscal year  payments were reduced by approximately 
for through the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma provides for a reduction in the annual payment update and adds a rural add on for discharges between april  through march  for the year ended december   less than of triad s revenues were derived from home health services 
on november   congress passed the fy omnibus appropriations bill which included a provision delaying the enforcement of the inpatient rehabilitation facility irf rule the irf rule 
the irf rule  implemented in  is one of the key eligibility criteria for irfs 
in may  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms issued a final rule that included restrictive changes to the conditions that qualify under the irf rule 
this rule requires that beginning july   at least of medicare patients are classified in one of the thirteen medical categories 
the deficit reduction act of dra extended by one year the transition back to 
the threshold increases to beginning july   on july   and up to the original on july  a hospital not meeting these thresholds will receive reduced payments based on medicare drgs instead of irf payments 
triad currently is in substantial compliance with the provisions of the may final rule 
currently  physicians are paid by medicare according to the physician fee schedule 
however  physicians working in rural health clinics  such as those maintained by triad  are reimbursed for their professional and administrative services through the rural health clinic subject to per visit limits unless the rural health clinic is based at a rural hospital with less than beds 
there are rural health clinics affiliated with triad s hospitals 
medicare has special payment provisions for sole community hospitals 
a sole community hospital is generally the only hospital in at least a mile radius 
seven of triad s facilities in continuing operations qualify as sole community hospitals under medicare regulations 
special payment provisions related to sole community hospitals may include a higher reimbursement rate  which is based on a blend of hospital specific costs and a national reimbursement rate  and a payment floor for capital costs which guarantees the sole community hospital capital reimbursement equal to of capital cost 
in addition  the tricare program that provides medical insurance benefits to government employees has special payment provisions for hospitals recognized as sole community hospitals for medicare purposes 
medicare provides  in the form of outlier payments  for additional payment  beyond standard drg payments  for covered hospital services furnished to a medicare beneficiary if the operating costs of furnishing those services exceed a certain threshold 
during  cms initiated an outlier reimbursement review process to assess nationally whether or not the amount of outlier payments being made to selected hospitals was appropriate 
cms issued proposed regulations in march that became effective october  that modified certain elements of the outlier reimbursement calculation 
triad derives less than of patient revenues from outlier payments and the modifications did not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
mma was signed into law on december  in addition to creating a new medicare prescription drug benefit  mma provides for a number of other significant changes in the medicare program 
these changes include a reduction in the annual update for ambulatory surgery center payments from april through the third quarter of and no payment update for the fourth quarter of through mma also provides for reductions in the annual update in home health agency payments for through  and for a reduction in the annual update for inpatient hospital payments from through for hospitals that do not submit to the medicare program quality reporting data specified under the national voluntary hospital reporting initiative 
mma also includes a number of provisions designed to increase medicare payments to small urban and rural hospitals  increasing the limit on disproportionate share payments that rural hospitals may receive  permitting an adjustment to the calculation of the standardized payment to benefit hospitals in low wage areas  such as rural hospitals  and equalizing the drg base payment rate among hospitals 
triad received additional reimbursement from mma of million in and million in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the dra was signed into law february  and includes provisions that will reduce medicare and medicaid spending by billion and billion  respectively  over five years 
the medicare provisions include a one year extension of the phase in period related to the irf rule  an increase in the reduction in the market basket index for hospitals that do not report required quality information in fiscal year to from  an extension of the apc hold harmless payments for small rural hospitals  a freeze in physician payments for fiscal year at current levels and a freeze in payments to home health agencies 
the medicaid provisions include expansion of recipient cost share amounts  extension of the look back period for asset transfers applicable to long term care coverage  redistribution of state children s health insurance program allotment surpluses and authorization for several demonstration projects to encourage community based services and provide alternative benefits through health opportunity accounts 
triad does not expect any material impact from the provisions of dra 
future legislation may decrease the rate of increase for the medicare program  which could make it more difficult to grow revenue and to maintain or improve operating margins 
medicaid 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps  or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital s cost of services 
medicaid is currently funded jointly by the state and the federal governments 
the dra includes provisions that reduce medicaid spending by billion over five years 
the federal government and many states may consider further reductions in the level of medicaid funding while at the same time expanding medicaid benefits  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by triad s hospitals 
annual cost reports 
all hospitals participating in the medicare program  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under pps  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal regulations require submission of annual cost reports covering medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries 
if triad or any triad facility is found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or similar programs  triad could be subject to substantial monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on triad s financial position and results of operations 
hca has agreed to indemnify triad in respect of losses arising from such government investigations for the periods prior to the spin off 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to triad under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts earned under the programs 
since virtually all components of the federal programs covered by cost reports are governed by pps  cost report settlements are primarily related to disproportionate share reimbursement  medicare bad debt reimbursement and medical education programs 
the medicare statute provides an additional payment to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low income patients above a minimum threshold defined by program regulations 
the medicare program reimburses hospitals of uncollected medicare beneficiary deductible and co payment amounts 
in order to qualify for reimbursement  hospitals must meet criteria set out in program regulations related to  among other things  reasonable collection efforts 
hospitals receive reimbursement for both direct graduate medical education and indirect graduate medical education 
this reimbursement is based in part on factors as of the end of a particular cost reporting period 
although triad estimates the amount of reimbursement that will be derived from these items throughout the year  final reimbursement is determined once the audits of the cost reports are completed  at the earliest 
providers also have rights of appeal  and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of prior years reports 
the due dates for cost reports for cost reporting periods ending after august  were delayed due to cms not issuing the final payment schedules for apcs 
beginning in october  the final payment schedules for apcs began to be issued for cost reporting periods ended after august  triad has filed cost reports for these periods 
the delay in filing these cost reports extended the time period of final determination of amounts earned 
as of december   substantially all of these cost reports had been finalized 
managed care 
pressures to control the cost of healthcare have historically resulted in increases in volumes attributable to managed care payers compared to traditional commercial indemnity insurers 
triad generally receives lower payments from managed care payers than from traditional commercial indemnity insurers  however  as part of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements its business strategy  triad has taken steps to improve its managed care position 
see business strategy for a more detailed discussion of such strategy 
commercial insurance 
triad hospitals provide services to some individuals covered by private healthcare insurance 
private insurance carriers make direct payments to such hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including prospective payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of the hospitals of triad 
government regulation and other factors licensure  certification and accreditation 
healthcare facilities are subject to federal  state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention  rate setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation 
all of triad s healthcare facilities are properly licensed under appropriate state laws 
all of the hospitals affiliated with triad are certified under the medicare and medicaid programs and all are accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  the effect of which is to permit the facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
should any facility lose its accreditation by this joint commission  or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and or medicaid program  the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs 
triad s facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal  state  local and independent review body regulations and standards 
the requirements for licensure  certification and accreditation are subject to change and  in order to remain qualified  it may be necessary for triad to effect changes in its facilities  equipment  personnel and services 
certificates of need 
the construction of new facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by state regulatory agencies under a con program 
triad operates in eight states alabama  alaska  mississippi  ohio  oregon  south carolina  tennessee and west virginia that require con approval to expand certain acute care hospital services 
such laws generally require state agency determination of public need and approval prior to the addition of beds or services or certain other capital expenditures 
failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the inability to expand facilities  add services  complete an acquisition or change ownership 
further  violation of such laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a facility s license 
state rate review 
the state of arizona adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals 
in the aggregate  state rate or budget review and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected the results of operations of triad 
triad is not able to predict whether any additional state rate or budget review or indigent tax provisions will be adopted and  accordingly  is not able to assess the effect thereof on its results of operations or financial condition 
utilization review 
federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to medicare and medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards  are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed 
these provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed by peer review organizations  which review the appropriateness of medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges  the quality of care provided  the validity of drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost 
peer review organizations may deny payment for services provided  may assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the standards of the peer review organization be excluded from participation in the medicare program 
utilization review is also a requirement of most non governmental managed care organizations 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws 
a trend affecting the healthcare industry today is the increased use of the federal false claims act  and  in particular  actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the false claims act s qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
when a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the false claims act  the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  to  for each separate false claim 
settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe damages methodology 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
in addition  a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court 
the dra includes a provision encouraging states to adopt their own false claims act provisions by increasing the states share of any recoveries related to medicaid funds 
from time to time  companies in the healthcare industry  including triad  may be subject to actions under the false claims act 
for a more complete discussion of litigation brought against triad under the false claims act  see governmental investigations 
federal and state fraud and abuse 
participation in the medicare program is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation 
if a hospital fails substantially to comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the medicare program or performs certain prohibited acts  such hospital s participation in the medicare program may be terminated or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed upon it under certain provisions of the social security act 
for example  the social security act prohibits providers and others from soliciting  receiving  offering or paying  directly or indirectly  any remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients to receive goods or services covered by a federal healthcare program the anti kickback statute 
in addition to felony criminal penalties fines up to  and imprisonment  the social security act establishes civil monetary penalties and the sanction of excluding violators from participation in the federal healthcare programs 
the anti kickback statute has been interpreted broadly by federal regulators and certain courts to prohibit the intentional payment of anything of value if even one purpose of the payment is to influence the referral of medicare or medicaid business 
therefore  many commonplace commercial arrangements between hospitals and physicians could be considered by the government to violate the anti kickback statute 
as authorized by congress  the oig has published final safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
currently  there are safe harbors for various activities  including  but not limited to investment interest  space rental  equipment rental  practitioner recruitment  personal services and management contracts  sale of practice  discounts  employees  investments in group practices  and ambulatory surgery centers 
the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement unlawful under the anti kickback statute 
the conduct and business arrangements  however  do risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities 
triad has a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to triad s hospitals 
triad also has contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements  including employment contracts  leases  and professional service agreements 
triad also provides financial incentives  including loans and minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into the communities served by triad s hospitals 
a number of triad s freestanding surgery centers have physician investors and physicians own interests in several of triad s hospitals 
some of the arrangements with physicians do not expressly meet requirements for safe harbor protection 
it cannot be assured that regulatory authorities that enforce the anti kickback statute will not determine that any of these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute or other federal or state laws 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid 
false claims include  but are not limited to  billing for services not rendered  billing for services without prescribed documentation  misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud 
like the anti kickback statute  these provisions are very broad 
further  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa created civil penalties for conduct including improper coding and billing for unnecessary goods and services 
hipaa also broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
the social security act also includes a provision commonly known as the stark law 
this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship if these entities provide certain designated health services that are reimbursable by medicare  including certain inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to  per prohibited service provided  assessments equal to twice the dollar value of each such service provided and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs 
there are a number of exceptions to the self referral prohibition  including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department 
there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers  including employment contracts  leases and recruitment agreements 
on january   cms issued final regulations subject to comment intended to clarify parts of the stark law and some of the exceptions to it 
these regulations are considered phase i of a two phase process 
phase i of the regulations became effective january   except in the case of the provisions relating to home health agencies  which became effective april  on march   cms published phase ii of these regulations 
these phase ii regulations  referred to as interim final regulations  became effective on july  phase ii addresses the statutory exceptions related to ownership and investment interests  statutory exceptions for certain compensation arrangements  and reporting requirements 
phase ii also creates some new regulatory exceptions and addresses public comments on phase i 
these regulations mandated certain changes to certain of triad s practices and procedures  but triad cannot yet predict all of the effects that the interim final regulations might have 
many of the states in which triad operates also have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti kickback statute and the stark law  some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care 
these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure 
little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws 
corporate practice of medicine 
some of the states in which triad operates have laws that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and pharmacies 
possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of a physician s license and civil and criminal penalties 
these statutes vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
although triad exercises care to structure its arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law  and believes such arrangements comply with applicable laws in all material respects  there can be no assurance that governmental officials charged with responsibility for enforcing these laws will not assert that triad  or certain transactions in which it is involved  is in violation of such laws  or that such laws ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with the interpretations of triad 
healthcare reform 
healthcare  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
proposals that have been considered or could be considered in the future include cost controls on hospitals  insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses  incentives for so called health savings accounts  requirements that hospitals publicly report certain quality indicators  payment reforms such that providers payments would be linked to quality and performance  proposals to permit hospitals to enter into gainsharing arrangements with physicians  medical malpractice tort reform  and requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees 
the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements costs of certain proposals would be funded in significant part by reductions in payments by governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid  to healthcare providers such as hospitals 
there can be no assurance that future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs will not have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of triad 
administrative simplification 
the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
cms published final regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically  which required compliance by october  cms also released final regulations relating to adoption of standards to protect the security and privacy of health related information 
the privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information and required compliance by april the regulations under hipaa establishing standards to protect the security of health related information required compliance by april violations of the regulations could result in civil penalties of up to  per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to  per violation 
triad is currently in compliance with the hipaa regulations 
in addition  triad s facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under hipaa  which vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
conversion legislation 
many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals 
these laws  in general  include provisions relating to attorney general approval  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  state attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise authority over these transactions based upon existing law 
in many states there has been an increased interest in the oversight of not for profit conversions 
the adoption of conversion legislation and the increased review of not for profit hospital conversions may increase the cost and difficulty or prevent the completion of transactions with not for profit organizations in certain states in the future 
revenue ruling during march  the internal revenue service irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of certain joint ventures between for profit and not for profit hospitals 
interpretation of the tax ruling could limit joint venture development with not for profit hospitals 
environmental matters 
triad is subject to various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
triad does not expect that it will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect its capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
insurance 
as is typical in the healthcare industry  triad is subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business 
to cover these claims  triad maintains professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts which it believes to be sufficient for its operations  although it is possible that some claims may exceed the scope of the coverage in effect 
there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices which will allow triad to maintain adequate levels of coverage 
substantially all losses in periods prior to the spin off are insured through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of hca and excess loss policies maintained by hca 
hca has agreed to indemnify triad in respect of claims covered by such insurance policies arising prior to the spin off 
after the spin off  triad elected to obtain insurance coverage on a claims incurred basis from hca s wholly owned insurance subsidiary  with excess coverage obtained from other carriers  which is subject to certain deductibles which triad considers to be reasonable 
for the facilities acquired in the quorum transaction  triad obtained tail coverage  subject to certain deductibles  to cover claims incurred prior to july  these facilities were converted to triad s existing coverage on august  triad has recorded an estimated liability for deductibles related to general and professional liability risks of approximately million at december  any losses incurred in excess of amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from working capital 
there can be no assurance that the cash flow of triad will be adequate to provide for professional and general liability claims in the future

governmental investigations false claims act litigation 
as a result of its ongoing discussions with the government prior to the merger of quorum with and into triad on april   quorum learned of two qui tam complaints against it alleging violations of the false claims act for claims allegedly submitted to the government involving two managed hospitals 
quorum accrued the estimated liability on these items prior to the merger and the matter remains under seal 
the government has requested that quorum conduct a self audit with respect to one medicare cost report for one managed hospital and three other specific issues 
the government has stated that it intends to investigate certain other allegations 
on september   triad was served with a qui tam complaint alleging  among other things  the submission of false claims for reimbursement and improper allocation of costs at a hospital in mississippi managed by qhr  which is named as an additional defendant 
the federal government has apparently elected not to intervene in the case and the complaint was unsealed 
triad is vigorously defending this matter and has filed a motion to dismiss  which is pending before the court 
while triad currently believes that it has no liability for any of the claims alleged in the complaint  discovery has not been completed and at this time triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the complaint 
on may   triad was served with a qui tam complaint alleging  among other things  the submission of false claims for reimbursement at two hospitals in georgia formerly managed by qhr 
the case was dismissed on october  the plaintiff has appealed the dismissal  and triad intends to vigorously contest the appeal 
on april   triad received a copy of a qui tam complaint alleging  among other things  the submission of false claims for reimbursement at a hospital in pennsylvania managed by qhr 
the federal government elected not to intervene in this case and the complaint was recently unsealed 
while triad intends to vigorously defend this matter  it is not yet able to form a view as to the probable liability for any of the claims alleged in the complaint 
triad s merger agreement with quorum will not provide indemnification to triad in respect of the qui tam complaints and investigations described above 
if triad incurs material liabilities as a result of qui tam litigation or governmental investigations  these matters could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
at this time triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the ongoing investigations or qui tam actions 
if violations of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs are found  then triad may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal damages and also may be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions or in the future may be substantial 
triad could be subject to substantial costs resulting from defending  or from an adverse outcome in  any current or future investigations  administrative proceedings or litigation 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  triad may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts paid to settle any of these matters may be material 
agreements entered into as a part of any settlement could also materially adversely affect triad 
any current or future investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
from time to time  triad may be the subject of additional investigations or a party to additional litigation  including qui tam actions  alleging violations of law 
triad may not know about such investigations or about qui tam actions filed against it unless and to the extent such are unsealed 
if any of those matters were successfully asserted against triad  there could be a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial position  results of operations or prospects

additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to triad or that it currently deems to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect triad s business operations 
any of these risks could materially and adversely affect triad s business  financial condition or results of operations 
our substantial leverage could have a significant effect on our operations 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of december   our consolidated long term debt equaled approximately billion 
as of december   we also were able to draw upon a revolving line of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to million  and there were no amounts outstanding 
we had million of letters of credit issued as of december  that reduced amounts available under the line of credit 
we also have the ability to incur significant amounts of additional debt  subject to the conditions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements although we believe that our future operating cash flow  together with available financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences  including the following the terms of our existing debt obligations contain  and the terms of any future debt obligations may contain  numerous financial and other restrictive covenants  which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and sell assets 
if we do not comply with these obligations  it may cause an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could require us to repay the indebtedness immediately 
we may be more vulnerable in the event of downturns in our businesses  in our industry  in the economy generally or if the government implements further limitations on reimbursement under medicare and medicaid 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes 
we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest of our indebtedness  which could reduce the amount of funds available for operations 
any borrowings we may make at variable interest rates leave us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally 
a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on medicare and medicaid payments  and reductions in medicare or medicaid payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the medicare and medicaid programs  which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
we derived approximately and of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in recent years  legislative changes have resulted in limitations on  and  in some cases  reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for  a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs 
other legislative changes have altered the method of amounts and payment for various services under the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  the fiscal year budget contemplated  among other things  an approximate billion reduction in medicaid spending over five years 
the dra resulted in an billion reduction in medicare and medicaid spending over five years 
in addition  the fiscal year budget contemplates  among other things  an approximate billion reduction in medicare spending over five years 
moreover  as a result of budgetary constraints  a number of states have adopted or are considering legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to provide universal coverage and additional care  including enrolling medicaid recipients in managed care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states medicaid systems 
we believe that hospital operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix  and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under medicare or medicaid 
future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
our revenues and profitability may be constrained by future cost containment initiatives undertaken by purchasers of healthcare services 
the competitive position of our hospitals is also affected by the increasing number of initiatives undertaken during the past several years by major purchasers of healthcare  including federal and state governments  insurance companies  and employers  to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare expenditures in order to contain healthcare costs 
as a result of these initiatives  managed care organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services packages represent an increasing portion of our admissions  which may result in reduced hospital revenue growth 
in addition  private payers increasingly are attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis  increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs such as hmos and ppos 
an increasing number of managed care organizations have experienced financial difficulties in recent years  in some cases resulting in bankruptcy or insolvency 
managed care organizations with whom we do business may encounter similar difficulties in paying claims in the future 
we believe that reductions in the payments that we receive for our services  coupled with the increased percentage of patient admissions from organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services and difficulty in collecting receivables from managed care organizations  could reduce our overall revenues and profitability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry  changes in or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce our revenue and profitability 
the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local law and regulations relating to licensure and certificate of need requirements  conduct of operations  ownership of facilities  addition of facilities and services  financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources  confidentiality  maintenance and security issues associated with medical records  billing for services  and prices for services 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations 
in certain public statements  governmental authorities have taken positions on issues for which little official interpretation was previously available 
some of these positions appear to be inconsistent with common practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals 
we have contracts with physicians providing services under a variety of financial arrangements such as employment contracts  leases and professional service agreements 
we also provide financial incentives  including loans and minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals 
several of the freestanding surgery centers affiliated with us have physician investors 
in several of our locations  physicians have acquired ownership interests in hospitals and other healthcare providers in which we own a majority interest 
some of our arrangements with our physicians do not expressly meet the requirements for safe harbor protection 
a determination that we have violated any of these laws could subject us to liability including criminal penalties  civil sanctions  including civil monetary penalties  and exclusion from participation in government programs such as medicare and medicaid or other federal healthcare programs 
consequently  a determination that we have violated these laws  or even a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and our business reputation could suffer significantly 
we have experienced deterioration in the collectibility of uninsured accounts receivable and we may continue to experience such deterioration in the future 
we record our accounts receivable at the estimated net realizable amount  and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from payers inability to make payments on accounts 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts for a discussion of our allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we have experienced growth in our uninsured receivables 
uninsured receivables are comprised of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements fully uninsured receivables  for which each patient is responsible for the entire bill  and receivables for deductibles and co insurance  which are amounts due from insured patients after insurance pays 
we believe that the growth in uninsured receivables for deductibles and co insurance resulted from changes in employer health plans that have increased the amount of out of pocket expenditures required to be paid by employees 
we also experienced an increase in managed care revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  in the fourth quarter of  which increased the amount of deductibles and co insurance 
we have also experienced growth and deterioration in fully uninsured receivables  which we believe resulted from weak economic conditions and rising healthcare costs 
we may have greater amounts of uninsured receivables in the future and if the collectibility of those uninsured receivables deteriorates  increases in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required  which could materially adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
our self pay discount program could reduce our profitability 
we implemented a self pay discount program in the fourth quarter of offering discounts to uninsured patients based on personal financial criteria and means testing 
in the second quarter of  we implemented an additional component to this program offering a discount to all uninsured patients based on the lowest managed care discount at each hospital 
these programs reduced revenues by approximately million in and million in  which we believe resulted in a similar reduction to the provision for doubtful accounts in both periods 
we believe that these programs did not have a significant impact on our earnings per share or cash flow 
although we do not yet have sufficient experience with these programs to conclusively determine the ongoing impact on our results of operations  we believe that the amount of self pay discounts will be approximately million to million per year in the future 
if our provision for doubtful accounts does not decrease in an amount similar to the reduction in our revenue from the self pay discount program  our profitability and cash flow could decline 
our future success depends on our ability to maintain good relationships with the physicians at our hospitals 
because physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions  our success has been  in part  dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on our hospitals medical staffs  the admissions practices of the physicians at our hospitals and our ability to maintain good relations with physicians 
physicians are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and  in many of the markets that we serve  most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals 
if we are unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  our hospitals admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline 
our revenues and earnings are heavily concentrated in texas  indiana  alabama and arkansas  which makes our revenues and earnings particularly sensitive to economic and other changes in these states 
for the year ended december   our texas facilities generated approximately of revenues and of income from continuing operations before income tax provision  indiana facilities generated approximately of revenues and of income from continuing operations before income tax provision  alabama facilities generated approximately of revenues and of income from continuing operations before income tax provision  and arkansas facilities generated approximately of revenues and of income from continuing operations before income tax provision 
accordingly  any change in the current demographic  economic  competitive or regulatory conditions in texas  indiana  alabama or arkansas could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we depend heavily on our senior and local management personnel  and the loss of the services of one or more of our key senior management personnel or key local management personnel could weaken our management team and our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently 
we are dependent upon the services and management experience of james d 
shelton  chairman and chief executive officer  and other of our executive officers 
if mr 
shelton or any of our other executive officers were to resign their positions or otherwise be unable to serve  our management could be weakened and our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain local managers at our hospitals and related facilities  the ability of our officers and key employees to manage growth successfully and our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain local management  our operating performance could decline 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals  and a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals in certain markets could weaken our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently 
in addition to the physicians and management personnel whom we employ  our operations are dependent on the efforts  ability and experience of our other healthcare professionals  such as nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians 
nurses  pharmacists  lab technicians and other healthcare professionals are generally our employees 
our future success will be influenced by our ability to attract and retain these skilled employees 
a shortage of healthcare professionals in certain markets  the loss of some or all of our key employees  or the inability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could cause our operating performance to decline 
our business and results of operations could suffer if access to our existing information systems is interrupted or if our planned conversion to new information systems is not successfully implemented 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems to process clinical and financial information 
under a contract expiring in may  hca provides financial  clinical  patient accounting and network information services to us 
if our access to these systems is interrupted  our operations could suffer 
moreover  we may be unable to integrate new information systems into our existing systems on a timely and cost effective basis when required by changing industry and regulatory standards and evolving technologies 
in january and february  we entered into agreements to replace our current information technology systems and services with new  outsourced clinical  revenue cycle and enterprise resource planning systems 
the conversion from our current information systems is expected to cost approximately million and take approximately four years to complete 
our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the conversion is not successfully completed  if we encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs during the conversion process  or if the new information systems do not meet our expectations 
in any such event  we may be required to incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and prospects 
we face competition from other hospitals and healthcare providers  which may result in a decline in our revenues  profitability and market share 
the healthcare business is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
in some cases  competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals 
certain of these competing facilities  particularly in urban markets  offer services  including extensive medical research and medical education programs  which are not offered by our facilities 
some of the hospitals that compete with us are owned or operated by tax supported governmental bodies or by private not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions  which can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and are exempt from sales  property and income taxes 
in some of these markets  we also face competition from other providers such as outpatient surgery  orthopedic  oncology and diagnostic centers 
although some of our hospitals operate in geographic areas where we are currently the sole provider of general acute care hospital services  these hospitals also face competition from other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers 
despite the fact that these competing hospitals may be as far as to miles away  patients in these markets increasingly may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals  managed care plan incentives or personal choice 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our healthcare consulting business competes in a fragmented industry for the small percentage of hospitals managed by hospital management companies 
competitors include large  national firms such as the national accounting firms  specialized healthcare firms  and numerous independent practitioners 
furthermore  some hospitals choose to obtain management services from the many large  tertiary care facilities that create referral networks with smaller surrounding hospitals 
as a result  hospitals have various alternatives to the management services currently offered by us 
the intense competition we face from other healthcare providers and other firms may result in a decline in our revenues  profitability and market share 
we may have difficulty implementing our business strategy of growth through acquisitions and joint ventures and we may have difficulty effectively integrating future acquisitions and joint ventures into our ongoing operations 
we also may have difficulty acquiring hospitals from not for profit entities due to increased regulatory scrutiny 
one element of our business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals or the formation of joint ventures in selected markets 
the competition to acquire hospitals and form joint ventures in the markets that we target are significant  and we may not be able to consummate suitable transactions on terms favorable to us if other healthcare companies  including those with greater financial resources than ours  are competing for the same target businesses 
in order to consummate future acquisitions or joint ventures  we may be required to incur or assume additional indebtedness 
we may not be able to obtain financing  if necessary  for any acquisitions or joint ventures that we might make or we may be required to borrow at higher rates and on less favorable terms 
additionally  we may not be able to effectively integrate the facilities that we acquire with our ongoing operations 
acquired businesses may have unknown or contingent liabilities  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations 
although we have policies to conform the practices of acquired facilities to our standards  and generally will seek indemnification from prospective sellers covering these matters  we may become liable for past activities of acquired businesses 
many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting sales  leases or other transactions in which control of not for profit hospitals is acquired by for profit entities 
these laws  in general  include provisions relating to state attorney general approval  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  state attorneys general in states without specific legislation governing these transactions may exercise authority based upon charitable trust and other existing law 
the increased legal and regulatory review of these transactions involving the change of control of not for profit entities may increase the costs required  or limit our ability  to acquire not for profit hospitals and may affect our ability to exercise existing purchase options for hospitals under hospital lease arrangements 
we may be subject to liabilities because of litigation and investigations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are defendants in various lawsuits and the subject of governmental investigations 
as a company in the healthcare industry  we are subject to the increased use of the qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions of the federal false claims act 
these provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government  such as when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
an entity found liable under the false claims act may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus certain civil penalties 
a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions and whistleblower provisions 
if we incur material liabilities as a result of litigation  including qui tam actions  or governmental investigation  these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
see note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of litigation and governmental investigations relating to our business 
at this time we cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the ongoing litigation or investigations 
if violations of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs are found  then we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal damages and also may be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions or in the future may be substantial 
we could be subject to substantial costs resulting from defending  or from an adverse outcome in  any current or future investigations  administrative proceedings or litigation 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  we may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts paid to settle any of these matters may be material 
agreements entered into as a part of any settlement could also materially adversely affect us 
any current or future investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
from time to time  we may be the subject of additional investigations or a party to additional litigation  including qui tam actions  alleging violations of law 
we may not know about those investigations or about qui tam actions filed against us unless and to the extent such matters are unsealed 
if any of those matters were successfully asserted against us  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or prospects 
if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement  we could be required to pay significant monetary penalties 
on november   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the oig and agreed to maintain our compliance program in accordance with the corporate integrity agreement 
this obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities 
violations of the corporate integrity agreement could subject our hospitals to substantial monetary penalties 
complying with the corporate integrity agreement may impose expensive and burdensome requirements on certain operations  which could have a material adverse impact on us 
we may be subject to liabilities because of claims arising from our hospital management activities 
we may be subject to liabilities from the activities or omissions of the employees of hospitals we manage or our employees in connection with the management of such hospitals 
recently  we and other hospital management companies have been subject to complaints alleging that these companies violated laws on behalf of hospitals they managed 
in some cases  plaintiffs brought actions against the management company instead of  or in addition to  their individually managed hospital clients for these violations 
our hospital management contracts generally require the hospitals we manage to indemnify us against certain claims and maintain specified amounts of insurance 
however  our managed hospitals or other third parties may not indemnify us against losses we incur arising out of the activities or omissions of the employees of the hospitals we manage 
if we are held liable for amounts exceeding the limits of insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of that coverage or any indemnity  or if any indemnity agreement is determined to be unenforceable  then any such liability could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to general liabilities or liabilities because of claims brought against our hospitals  we could experience rising malpractice insurance premiums  and our insurance carriers could become insolvent 
in recent years  plaintiffs have brought actions against hospitals and other healthcare providers  alleging malpractice  product liability or other legal theories 
many of these actions involved large claims and significant defense costs 
we maintain professional malpractice liability and general liability insurance coverage  subject to certain deductibles  to cover claims arising out of the operations of our hospitals 
some of the claims  however  could exceed the scope of the coverage in effect or coverage of particular claims could be denied 
while our professional and other liability insurance have been adequate in the past to provide for liability claims  such insurance may not be available for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
moreover  healthcare providers in the industry have experienced significant increases in the premiums for malpractice insurance in the past  and such costs may rise in the future 
malpractice insurance coverage may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable deductible amounts 
in addition  because of the significant increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums in certain states  we may encounter difficulty recruiting and retaining physicians or continuing to provide certain services at our hospitals 
in addition  one or more of our insurance carriers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill its obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  we self insure portions of our workers compensation  health insurance  and general and professional liability insurance coverage and maintain excess loss policies 
the liabilities estimated for these self insured portions are based on actuarially determined estimates which are based on a number of factors including amount and timing of historical payments  severity of individual cases  anticipated volume of services provided and discount rates for future cash flows 
the amounts of any ultimate actual payments for workers compensation and general and professional liability risks may not become known for several years after incurrence 
moreover  any factors changing the underlying data used in determining these estimates would result in revisions to the liabilities which could result in a decrease in income 
we could incur substantial liability if our spin off from hca was found to be taxable 
on march   hca received a private letter ruling from the irs concerning the united states federal income tax consequences of the spin off of lifepoint hospitals  inc and us by hca and the restructuring transactions that preceded the spin off 
the private letter ruling provided that the spin off generally was tax free to hca and hca s stockholders  except for any cash received instead of fractional shares 
the irs has issued additional private letter rulings that supplement its march  ruling  including supplemental rulings stating that the quorum merger and certain other transactions occurring subsequent to the spin off do not adversely affect the private letter rulings previously issued by the irs 
the march  ruling and the supplemental rulings are based upon the accuracy of representations as to numerous factual matters and as to certain intentions of hca  lifepoint and us 
the inaccuracy of any of those representations could cause the irs to revoke all or part of any of the rulings retroactively 
if the spin off were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment  then  in general  additional corporate tax  which would be substantial  would be payable by the consolidated group of which hca is the common parent 
each member of hca s consolidated group at the time of the spin off  including us  would be jointly and severally liable for this tax liability 
in addition  we entered into a tax sharing and indemnification agreement with hca and lifepoint  which prohibits us from taking actions that could jeopardize the tax treatment of either the spin off or the restructuring transactions that preceded the spin off  and requires us to indemnify hca and lifepoint for any taxes or other losses that result from our actions  which amounts could be substantial 
if we are required to make any indemnity payments or otherwise are liable for additional taxes relating to the spin off  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected

index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview triad is one of the largest publicly owned hospital companies in the united states and provides healthcare services through hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers that it owns and operates in small cities and selected urban markets primarily in the southern  midwestern and western united states 
as of march   triad s hospital facilities include general acute care hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers located in the states of alabama  alaska  arizona  arkansas  indiana  louisiana  mississippi  nevada  new mexico  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  south carolina  tennessee  texas and west virginia 
included among these facilities is one hospital operated through a joint venture that is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
these facilities include two acute care hospitals in ohio and tennessee that were acquired in and exclude three hospitals that were sold in january triad is also a minority investor in three joint ventures that own seven general acute care hospitals in georgia and nevada 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  qhr  triad also provides management and consulting services to independent general acute care hospitals located throughout the united states 
triad s general acute care hospitals typically provide a full range of services commonly available in hospitals  such as internal medicine  general surgery  cardiology  oncology  neurosurgery  orthopedics  obstetrics  diagnostic and emergency services 
these hospitals also generally provide outpatient and ancillary healthcare services such as outpatient surgery  laboratory  radiology  respiratory therapy  cardiology and physical therapy 
outpatient services also are provided by ambulatory surgery centers operated by triad 
in addition  some of triad s general acute care hospitals have a limited number of licensed psychiatric beds and provide psychiatric skilled nursing services 
in the third quarter of  triad s hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers in hattiesburg  mississippi  lake charles  louisiana  victoria  texas and wharton  texas were directly and indirectly impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
triad had to evacuate the aforementioned facilities in louisiana and texas and these facilities were not operational for three to eight days during the quarter 
the facility in louisiana was not operational until the first week of october 
triad also sustained various levels of property damage at the facilities in mississippi and louisiana 
triad estimates that its revenues were reduced by approximately million and income from continuing operations was reduced by approximately million  or per diluted share 
at december   triad had approximately million of accrued estimated costs  in addition to costs paid  and has recorded an estimated receivable for insurance reimbursement of approximately million  of which an interim settlement of million was received in triad acquired two new hospitals by entering into joint ventures with non profit partners in the second quarter and fourth quarter of and opened one new hospital in the first quarter of triad acquired one hospital in the fourth quarter of and opened one hospital in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  triad acquired seven new hospitals  either by acquiring all of the assets of the hospital  leasing the existing facility or entering into joint ventures with non profit partners 
one of the hospitals acquired in was sold in  as discussed below 
these events affect the comparability of the results of operations for the years ended december   and in the second quarter of  triad sold to its partner its interest in its freestanding ambulatory surgery centers in phoenix  arizona and terminated its lease at one hospital in lake city  south carolina 
these entities were reclassified as discontinued operations in the second quarter of in the third quarter of  triad entered into an agreement to sell its hospital in searcy  arkansas 
this entity was reclassified as discontinued operations in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  triad entered into a definitive agreement to sell its hospitals in wharton  texas  pampa  texas and hope  arkansas 
these entities were reclassified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  and the transaction was completed in january triad s results of operations and statistics for prior periods have been restated to reflect these reclassifications

index to financial statements forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains disclosures which are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts  and can be identified by the use of words such as may  believe  will  expect  project  estimate  anticipate  plan or continue 
these forward looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of triad and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could significantly affect current plans and expectations and the future financial condition and results of triad 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the highly competitive nature of the healthcare business  the efforts of insurers and other payers  healthcare providers and others to contain healthcare costs  possible changes in medicare  medicaid and other government programs that may limit reimbursements to healthcare providers  changes in federal  state or local regulations affecting the healthcare industry  the possible enactment of federal or state healthcare reform  the ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel  including physicians and nurses  the departure of key executive officers from triad  the successful implementation of triad s new information technology system  claims and legal actions relating to professional liabilities and other matters  fluctuations in the market value of triad common stock  changes in accounting standards  changes in general economic conditions or geo political events  future acquisitions  joint venture developments or divestitures which may result in additional charges  the ability to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms  the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of triad s business  changes in business strategy or development plans  the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance  potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations  timeliness of reimbursement payments received under government programs  and other risk factors described in this report 
as a consequence  current plans  anticipated actions and future financial condition and results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of triad 
you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates triad s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon triad s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires triad to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  triad evaluates its estimates  including those related to third party payer discounts  allowance for doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  self insured liability risks and contingencies and litigation 
triad bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
triad believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition triad s healthcare facilities have entered into agreements with third party payers  including government programs and managed care health plans  under which the facilities are paid based upon several methodologies 
table of contents 
index to financial statements including established charges  the cost of providing services  predetermined rates per diagnosis  fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges 
revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payers and others for healthcare services provided 
triad has multiple patient accounting systems and  therefore  estimates for contractual allowances are calculated both systemically and manually  depending on the type of payer involved and the patient accounting system used by each hospital 
in certain systems  the contractual payment terms are preloaded into the system and the system calculates the expected reimbursement amounts 
in other systems  the contractual adjustments are determined manually using historical collections on each type of payer 
even for systems that record the expected reimbursement amounts  there are still manual estimates based upon historical collections recorded for payers that are not significant or do not have specific contractual terms 
all contractual adjustments  regardless of type of payer or method of calculation  are reviewed and compared to actual payment experience 
changes in estimates of contractual allowances for non government payers have not historically been significant 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex  subject to interpretation  and are routinely modified for provider reimbursement 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal regulations require submission of annual cost reports covering medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to program beneficiaries 
triad s facilities have cost reporting year ends throughout triad s fiscal year 
settlements under reimbursement agreements with governmental payers are estimated and recorded in the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known or as the service years are no longer subject to audit  review or investigation 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to triad under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts earned under the programs 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
triad had million  million and million of favorable prior year governmental cost report settlements in the years ended december   and  respectively 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  triad implemented a self pay discount program that offers discounts to uninsured patients based on personal financial criteria and means testing 
the amount of the discount varies based on each patient s financial condition 
this self pay discount program reduced revenue by approximately million and million in and  respectively  which triad believes resulted in a similar reduction to the provision for doubtful accounts 
currently  triad anticipates that the amount of this self pay discount component in will continue in the future 
triad implemented an additional component to its self pay discount program during the second quarter of this additional component offers a discount for all uninsured patients based on the lowest managed care discount in each hospital location 
this component of the self pay discount reduced revenues by approximately million in which triad believes resulted in a similar reduction to the provision for doubtful accounts 
currently  triad anticipates that the amount of this self pay discount component will be approximately to million per year in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts the largest component of triad s allowance for doubtful accounts on patient accounts receivable is from uninsured accounts 
these include both amounts due from fully uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles for which insured patients are responsible 
each patient s insurance coverage is verified as early as possible before a scheduled admission or procedure  including eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  for all scheduled accounts so that patients can be notified of their estimated amounts due 
insurance coverage is verified within hours for all urgent and direct admissions 
to improve upfront collections  triad endeavors to collect the uninsured portion of amounts due at the time of or prior to the scheduled admission or procedure 
to facilitate the upfront collection process  triad has instituted an incentive program for its employees which is based on the amount of upfront cash collections on uninsured accounts 
triad s policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  typically no longer than one year after date of discharge 

table of contents 
index to financial statements triad maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from payers inability to make payments on accounts 
triad analyzes the ultimate collectibility of its accounts receivable after one year  using a regression analysis of the historical net write offs to determine the amount of those accounts receivable that were ultimately not collected 
the results of this analysis are then applied to the current accounts receivable to determine the allowance necessary for that period 
this process  or ar lookback  is performed each quarter 
the ar lookback is augmented by other analytical methods such as changes in the level of uninsured receivables  accounts receivable days  cash collections and accounts receivable agings 
in the fourth quarter of  the ar lookback process reflected a favorable estimation of the required allowance for doubtful accounts 
management determined that the favorable allowance estimation determined through the ar lookback process was overly optimistic because the self pay discounts appeared to skew the results 
therefore  management relied more on the other analytical methods to determine the appropriate allowance 
after reviewing these other analytical methods  management recorded an allowance of approximately of discounted uninsured receivables 
using this methodology  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which includes million that was recorded in the third quarter of  is more than the ar lookback process would have required 
triad will continue to perform the ar lookback process quarterly  but management anticipates that it will be to months before the impact of the self pay discounts will be fully reflected in the historical write offs 
as such  management plans to rely primarily on other analytical methods to establish its allowance for doubtful accounts until the impact of the self pay discounts is fully incorporated into the historical write offs 
a one percentage point change in estimate of the allowance as a percentage of uninsured receivables would change pre tax income by approximately million  or per diluted share 
if payers ability to pay deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
triad has certain facilities that are not included in the ar lookback process due to insufficient historical data 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for these facilities was estimated using a variety of other analytical methods 
when the historical data is sufficient  these facilities will be converted to the ar lookback process 
in the fourth quarter of  the allowance for doubtful accounts for these facilities was calculated using the same method as discussed above 
property  equipment and amortizable intangible assets triad evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of  and amortizable intangible assets and recognizes impairment losses when the fair value is less than the carrying value 
when events  circumstances and operating results indicate that the carrying values of certain long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets to be held and used might be impaired  triad prepares projections of the probability weighted undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the projections indicate that the recorded amounts are not expected to be recoverable  such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value 
the fair value of assets held for sale is determined using estimated selling values 
if the estimated selling value is less than the recorded amount  an impairment charge would be required 
indicators of potential impairment are typically beyond the control of management 
if the probability weighted cash flows become less favorable than those projected by management  impairments may be required 
goodwill triad reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
goodwill is reviewed at the reporting unit level  which is defined as one level below an operating segment 
triad has determined that its reporting units for its owned operations segment are at the division level 
triad estimated fair values of the reporting units using discounted projected future cash flows with a discount rate of for hospital operations 
impairment is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the calculations of fair value are subject to a variety of assumptions  including projected cash flows and discount rates 
the calculated fair values were well in excess of the carrying values of each division and an increase in the discount rate of one percentage point would not result in any impairments 
if projected future cash flows become less favorable than those projected by management  impairments may be required 

table of contents 
index to financial statements income taxes triad records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
triad has considered several items including ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event triad were to determine that the realization of its deferred tax asset in the future is different than its net recorded amount  an adjustment to income would be necessary 
despite triad s belief that its tax return positions are accurate and supportable  triad recognizes that certain tax benefits claimed may be subject to challenge and may not be upheld under tax audit 
to reflect the possibility that certain tax benefits may not be sustained  triad establishes tax reserves  based on management s judgment  and adjusts the tax reserves as required in light of new or changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
generally  the establishment of tax reserves increases the income tax provision in the reporting period in which such tax reserves are established 
any unfavorable adjustments to the tax reserves increase the income tax provision in that reporting period and any favorable adjustments to the tax reserves decrease the income tax provision in that reporting period 
triad established a tax reserve through goodwill from the purchase accounting entries for the quorum acquisition 
any adjustment to this tax reserve would increase or decrease the value of the acquired goodwill instead of the income tax provision 
self insured liability risks triad self insures portions of its workers compensation  health insurance and general and professional liability insurance coverage and maintains excess loss policies 
the liabilities estimated for these self insured portions are based on actuarially determined estimates prepared on a semi annual basis  except for health insurance which is prepared quarterly 
there are many factors that are used in determining the estimates  including amount and timing of historical payments  severity of individual cases  anticipated volume of services provided and discount rates for future cash flows 
the amounts of any ultimate actual payments for workers compensation and general and professional liability risks may not become known for several years after incurrence 
any factors changing the underlying data used in determining these estimates would result in revisions to the liabilities which could result in an adjustment to income 
contingencies triad is subject to claims and suits arising from governmental investigations and other matters in the ordinary course of business 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
triad is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of recorded liability  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the recorded liability may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  which could result in an adjustment to income 
any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
results of operations revenue volume trends triad has entered into agreements with third party payers  including government programs and managed care health plans  under which rates are based upon established charges  the cost of providing services  predetermined rates per diagnosis  fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges 
triad s facilities have experienced revenue rate growth from increases in managed care pricing and in reimbursement from government programs 
triad s reimbursement from government programs increased approximately to beginning in the fourth quarter of triad anticipates same facility revenue rate growth of to in there can be no assurances that triad will continue to receive these levels of revenue rate increases in the future 
triad implemented a self pay discount program in the fourth quarter of that offers discounts to uninsured patients based on personal financial criteria and means testing 
the amount of the discount varies based on each patient s financial condition 
triad implemented an additional component to its self pay discount program in the second quarter of which offers discounts to all uninsured patients based on the lowest managed care discount in each hospital location 
triad s revenue rate growth was negatively affected by the self pay discount programs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements patient volumes  on a same facility basis  increased slightly in compared to volumes in were affected by the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita  changes in insurance admission criteria at certain alabama facilities and a shift in admissions from an existing triad facility to a new triad facility 
triad anticipates that volumes will increase approximately to per year in the future 
if triad s volumes decrease  then its results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
triad s revenues continue to be affected by an increasing proportion of revenue being derived from fixed payment  higher discount sources  including medicare  medicaid and managed care plans 
triad expects patient volumes from medicare and medicaid to continue to increase due to the general aging of the population and expansion of state medicaid programs 
volumes from managed care plans are expected to increase due to insurance companies  government programs other than medicare and employers purchasing healthcare services for their employees by negotiating discounted amounts that they will pay healthcare providers rather than by paying standard prices 
the percentage of revenues from uninsured patients was affected by the self pay discounts 
excluding the impact of the self pay discounts  revenues from uninsured patients would have increased in compared to the percentages of patient revenues by provider are as follows for the years ended december  medicare medicaid managed care plans uninsured other sources changes in the proportion of services reimbursed based upon fixed payment amounts where the payment is based upon the diagnosis  regardless of the cost incurred or level of service provided  could impact revenues  earnings and cash flows 
mma was signed into law on december  in addition to creating a new medicare prescription drug benefit  mma provides for a number of other significant changes in the medicare program 
these changes include a reduction in the annual update for ambulatory surgery center payments from april through the third quarter of and no payment update for the fourth quarter of through mma also provides for reductions in the annual update in home health agency payments for through  and for a reduction in the annual update for inpatient hospital payments from through for hospitals that do not submit to the medicare program quality reporting data specified under the national voluntary hospital reporting initiative 
mma also includes a number of provisions designed to increase medicare payments to small urban and rural hospitals  including increasing the limit on disproportionate share payments that rural hospitals may receive  permitting an adjustment to the calculation of the standardized payment to benefit hospitals in low wage areas  such as rural hospitals  and equalizing the drg base payment rate among hospitals 
triad received an additional million and million in reimbursement from mma in and  respectively 
triad s revenues have been affected by the trend toward certain services being performed more frequently on an outpatient basis rather than on an inpatient basis 
growth in outpatient services is expected to continue  although possibly at a slower rate  in the healthcare industry as procedures performed on an inpatient basis are converted to outpatient procedures through continuing advances in pharmaceutical and medical technologies 
the redirection of certain procedures to an outpatient basis is also influenced by pressures from payers and patients to perform certain procedures as outpatient care rather than inpatient care 
outpatient revenues as a percentage of patient revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pressures on medicare and medicaid reimbursement  increasing percentages of patient volume related to patients participating in managed care plans and continuing trends toward more services being performed on an outpatient basis are expected to present ongoing challenges 
the challenges are magnified by triad s inability to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements control these trends and the associated risks 
to maintain and improve its operating margins in future periods  triad must increase patient volumes and improve managed care contracts while controlling the costs of providing services 
if triad is not able to achieve reductions in the cost of providing services through increased operational efficiencies  and the rate of increase in reimbursements and payments declines  results of operations and cash flows could deteriorate 
management believes that the proper response to these challenges includes the delivery of a broad range of quality healthcare services to physicians and patients with operating decisions being primarily made by the local management teams and local physicians with the strategic support of corporate management 
management continues to rationalize its portfolio of facilities 
triad acquired two new hospitals by entering into joint ventures with non profit partners in the second quarter and fourth quarter of and opened one new hospital in the first quarter of during  triad acquired one hospital and opened a new hospital 
the facilities acquired and opened in and increased revenues by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  triad disposed of two hospitals and its interest in a freestanding ambulatory center venture and determined that three additional hospitals would be designated as held for sale  which were sold in these facilities were reclassified as discontinued operations in in  triad sold two hospitals it leased to hca and sold two additional hospitals 
these four hospitals were reclassified as discontinued operations in in  triad disposed of its interest in one entity and determined that two hospitals would be designated as held for sale  which were sold in these three entities were reclassified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of triad s results of operations and statistics for prior periods have been restated to reflect these reclassifications 
these facilities had revenues of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
other trends provision for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of  the ar lookback process reflected a favorable estimation of the required allowance for doubtful accounts 
management determined that the favorable allowance estimation determined through the ar lookback process was overly optimistic because the self pay discounts appeared to skew the results 
therefore  management relied more on other analytical methods to determine the appropriate allowance 
after reviewing these other analytical methods  management recorded an allowance of approximately of discounted uninsured receivables 
using this methodology  the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   which includes million that was recorded in the third quarter of  was more than the ar lookback process would have required

index to financial statements triad s uninsured receivables as a percentage of billed hospital receivables decreased to at december  from at december  the decrease in the percentage of uninsured receivables is due  in part  to the impact of the self pay discount programs 
uninsured receivables increased approximately million in  with the amounts relating to receivables from co payments and deductibles increasing million and the amount relating to receivables from fully uninsured patients increasing million 
total billed receivables increased million over the same time period 
in  ten hospitals changed the revenue cycle process for writing off accounts to conform to triad s standards  which have accounts age after placement with a primary collection agency instead of writing the account off at that point in time 
co payments and deductibles have increased  in part  from changes in employer health plans  whereby employees are responsible for a greater portion of services 
the increase in accounts receivable was also affected by the acquisition of two hospitals during the amounts of the increases in from these facilities are as follows co payments and deductibles million fully uninsured million total billed million days in accounts receivable increased to days at december  from days at december  days in accounts receivable decreased to days at december  from days at december  management s target days in accounts receivable were and days at december  and  respectively 
days in accounts receivable increased  in part  due to the revenue cycle process changes discussed above 
triad has also experienced an increase in high acuity procedures  which typically have a longer payment timeframe 
days in accounts receivable was impacted by an increase in managed care revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  compared to medicare revenues in the fourth quarter of managed care payers typically are slower payers than governmental payers 
also impacting days in accounts receivable was timing of claims billed and processed at women and children s hospital in lake charles  louisiana as a result of hurricane rita 
the decrease in resulted from a slight reduction in uninsured patient volume  improvement in medicare receivables and continued conversion of acquired hospitals to triad s collection standards 
days in accounts receivable is calculated by dividing patient receivables  excluding cost report receivables payables  less allowance for doubtful accounts by the most recent three month period s daily patient revenue  excluding prior year cost report settlements  less provision for doubtful accounts 
the approximate percentage of billed hospital receivables which is a component of total receivables is summarized as follows december  december  insured receivables uninsured receivables total the percentages have been restated for reclassifications to discontinued operations 
included in insured receivables are accounts that are pending approval from medicaid 
these receivables were approximately and of billed hospital receivables at december  and december   respectively 
triad maintains a contractual allowance on these receivables

table of contents 
index to financial statements the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable decreased due primarily to the impact of the self pay discount programs 
triad estimates that the allowance for doubtful accounts percentage of accounts receivables  excluding the self pay discounts  would have been approximately at december  and at december  the approximate percentages of billed hospital receivables in summarized aging categories are as follows december  december  to days to days to days over days total the percentages have been restated for reclassifications to discontinued operations 
the increase in the older aging categories is primarily from the revenue cycle changes discussed previously 
although historical write offs  the percentage of revenue from uninsured patients and the amount of receivables from uninsured patients increased in  triad is unable to determine if this will continue in if uninsured receivables increase or collectibility of these receivables deteriorates in the future  then triad s results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected

contingencies false claims act litigation as a result of its ongoing discussions with the government prior to the merger of quorum into triad on april   quorum learned of two qui tam complaints against it alleging violations of the false claims act for claims allegedly submitted to the government involving two managed hospitals 
quorum accrued the estimated liability on these items prior to the merger and the matter remains under seal 
the government has requested that quorum conduct a self audit with respect to one medicare cost report for one managed hospital and three other specific issues 
the government has stated that it intends to investigate certain other allegations 
on september   triad was served with a qui tam complaint alleging  among other things  the submission of false claims for reimbursement and improper allocation of costs at a hospital in mississippi managed by qhr  which is named as an additional defendant 
the federal government has apparently elected not to intervene in the case and the complaint was unsealed 
triad is vigorously defending this matter and has filed a motion to dismiss  which is pending before the court 
while triad currently believes that it has no liability for any of the claims alleged in the complaint  discovery has not been completed and at this time  triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the complaint

index to financial statements intervene in this case and the complaint was recently unsealed 
while triad intends to vigorously defend this matter  it is not yet able to form a view as to the probable liability for any of the claims alleged in the complaint 
triad s merger agreement with quorum will not provide indemnification to triad in respect of the qui tam complaints and investigations described above 
if triad incurs material liabilities as a result of qui tam litigation or governmental investigation  these matters could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
at this time triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the ongoing investigations or qui tam actions 
if violations of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs are found  then triad may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal damages and also may be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions or in the future may be substantial 
triad could be subject to substantial costs resulting from defending  or from an adverse outcome in  any current or future investigations  administrative proceedings or litigation 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  triad may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts paid to settle any of these matters may be material 
agreements entered into as a part of any settlement could also materially adversely affect triad 
any current or future investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
from time to time  triad may be the subject of additional investigations or a party to additional litigation  including qui tam actions  alleging violations of law 
triad may not know about those investigations or about qui tam actions filed against it unless and to the extent such matters are unsealed 
if any of those matters were successfully asserted against triad  there could be a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial position  results of operations or prospects 
income taxes the irs is currently conducting an examination of the federal income tax returns for triad s short taxable years ended april   june  and december   and the taxable years ended december  and on december   the irs proposed adjustments disallowing deductions for portions of the payments made to the federal government in settlement of three qui tam cases that had been brought against quorum 
the total proposed adjustments with respect to the settlement payment deductions  if sustained  would increase taxable income in the amount of approximately million and result in the payment by triad of additional cash taxes of approximately million 
any cash taxes paid resulting from the proposed adjustments in excess of the tax reserve previously established would increase goodwill from the acquisition of quorum 
triad believes its reporting of the deductions with respect to the settlement of the three qui tam cases was appropriate 
accordingly  triad intends to contest the proposed adjustments and is considering various alternatives for doing so  including filing protests and seeking referral to the irs appeals office 
in the opinion of management  even if the irs proposed adjustments were sustained  this would not have a material effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
in february  triad  on behalf of certain jointly owned entities in which quorum owned a majority interest  reached final settlements with the irs with respect to the jointly owned entities taxable years ended june  and these settlements related to adjustments to tax accounting methods adopted for computing bad debt expense  the valuation of purchased hospital property and equipment and related depreciable lives  income recognition related to cost reports and the loss calculation on a taxable liquidation of a subsidiary 
triad has also agreed to carryover adjustments relating to the jointly owned entities taxable years ended june     and the taxable years ended december   and resulting from the prior years settlements 
in the opinion of management  the settlements did not have a material impact on triad s results of operations or financial position

triad  qhr and irg have been vigorously defending the claim 
on may   a jury returned a verdict against triad  qhr and irg  and on june   the court entered a judgment on such verdict in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
triad  qhr and irg have appealed such judgment 
triad has reserved million in respect of this judgment 
triad is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of  or interference with  physicians staff privileges 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal  state and local laws have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit triad s ability to increase prices 
revenues for acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government s prospective payment system 
medicare revenues  as a percentage of patient revenues  were approximately in  in  and in management believes that hospital industry operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix  and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program 
as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures  triad s ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
medicare prospective payments increased in  and and management anticipates that the average rate of increase in medicare prospective payments will be relatively consistent in healthcare reform healthcare  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  either nationally or at the state level 
proposals that have been considered or could be considered in the future include cost controls on hospitals  insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses  incentives for so called health savings accounts  requirements that hospitals publicly report certain quality indicators  payment reforms such that providers payments would be linked to quality and performance  proposals to permit hospitals to enter into gainsharing arrangements with physicians  medical malpractice tort reform  and requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees 
the costs of certain proposals would be funded in significant part by reductions in payments by governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid  to healthcare providers such as hospitals 
there can be no assurance that future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs will not have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of triad

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk triad is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  triad had entered into an interest rate swap 
interest rate swaps are contracts which allow the parties to exchange fixed and floating rate interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the interest rate swap is consummated 
the interest rate swap was entered into as a cash flow hedge  which effectively converted a notional amount of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
triad s policy is to not hold or issue

index to financial statements derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
triad is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty 
the interest rate swap effectively converted a notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
the term of the interest rate swap expired in june with respect to triad s interest bearing liabilities  approximately million of long term debt at december  was subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  million at december  was subject to fixed rates of interest 
the estimated fair value of triad s total long term debt was  million at december  the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long term debt with the same maturities  when available  or discounted cash flows 
based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential annualized losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately million 
the impact of such a change in interest rates on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
the estimated changes to interest expense and the fair value of long term debt are determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on triad s borrowing costs and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in triad s credit ratings or the overall level of economic activity 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change
