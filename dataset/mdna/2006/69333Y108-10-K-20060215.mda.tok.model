this quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented

table of contents historically  pf chang s has experienced variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to preopening expenses 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening expenses associated with a given restaurant within the two months immediately preceding and the month of the opening of the restaurant 
additionally  there may be variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to partner investment expense as a result of the timing of opening new restaurants and the timing of purchasing partner interests 
partner investment expense generally represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interests and our partners cash capital contribution for these interests 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had and is expected to continue to have  a meaningful impact on preopening expenses  labor  operating and partner investment costs until such time as a larger base of restaurants in operation mitigates such impact 
liquidity and capital resources pf chang s has funded its capital requirements since its inception through sales of equity securities  debt financing and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded the net income for the periods due principally to the effect of depreciation and amortization  an increase in operating liabilities and the effect of minority interest and partnership related non cash expenses

the building is currently being utilized as pf chang s corporate office 
during  capital expenditures included million in additional costs to build out this office space 
we intend to open new bistro restaurants and new pei wei restaurants in fiscal year  as well as one additional asian inspired concept  which is currently in the early development phase 
we expect that our planned future bistro restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment per restaurant of approximately million 
we expect to spend approximately  per restaurant for preopening costs  which excludes non cash rent expense of approximately  total cash investment per each pei wei restaurant is expected to average  and we expect to spend  per restaurant for preopening costs  which excludes non cash rent expense of approximately  the anticipated total cash investment per restaurant is based on recent historical averages which have increased over prior years due to increases in construction related costs of steel  aluminum and lumber 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
financing activities in fiscal years  and consisted primarily of repayments on long term debt  distributions to minority partners  proceeds from contributions by minority partners and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in december of  pf chang s entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a commercial lending institution 
the credit facility allowed for borrowings up to million at an interest rate ranging from to basis points over the applicable london interbank offered rate libor 
pf chang s elected not to renew the revolving credit facility  which expired on december  amounts committed for the issuance of letters of credit  which are required by our insurance companies for workers compensation and general liability insurance claims  total million and are included in the balance sheet within restricted short term investments as of january  our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the 
table of contents arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our current cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our projected capital requirements through and the foreseeable future 
in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we can not assure you that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
on january   pf chang s purchased the minority interest held by key employees in its pei wei asian diner subsidiary for approximately million  thereby making pei wei asian diner a wholly owned subsidiary 
the purchase price consideration consisted of million in cash and the conversion of outstanding options to purchase  common shares of pei wei asian diner  inc stock into options to purchase approximately  shares of pf chang s common stock 
the transaction did not involve any changes in management or key positions in pei wei 
as of january   there were partners within the pf chang s china bistro  inc partnership system 
during  we had the opportunity to purchase partners interests  which had reached their five year threshold period during the year  as well as additional partners interests which had either reached the end of their initial five year term in prior years or which related to partners who had left the company prior to the initial five year term 
of these  we purchased interests in their entirety  one partial interest and have elected not to purchase the remaining opportunities 
these purchases totaled approximately million 
of the total purchase price  approximately million was paid in cash while the remaining balance has been recorded as debt on the balance sheet at january  in  we will also have the opportunity to purchase additional partnership interests 
if all of these interests are purchased  the total purchase price will approximate million to million based upon the estimated fair value of the respective interests at january  these amounts are subject to change based upon changes in the estimated fair value of the respective interests from january  through the date of purchase 
if we purchase all of these interests in  the estimated financial impact would be a reduction of cash of approximately million to million and an increase to earnings per share of based upon the elimination of the related minority interest charge in our income statement  partially offset by the anticipated intangible amortization expense relating to the purchase  both net of related income taxes 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
lease obligation pf chang s leases all of its restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we took possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  the company records the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and records the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 

table of contents partnership structure pf chang s utilizes a partnership structure to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of its restaurants 
each partner who wishes to participate in the partnership structure is required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and ten percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees generally no more than ten percent of an individual restaurant is owned in total by minority partners 
we perform an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of an annual valuation analysis performed by a third party valuation specialist 
this methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners is currently recognized as expense upon purchase of the respective interest 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  pf chang s has the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows of the subject restaurant s or region s financial results 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash or common stock of pf chang s over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
if and when we repurchase our partners interests  the excess  if any  of the purchase price over the imputed fair value of these interests has been recognized as expense in the month the repurchase occurs for all fiscal years prior to and including now that the modification to our agreements as discussed in risk factors has been in effect for at least six months  the excess  if any  will be recorded as intangibles  which are amortized over approximately years for bistros 
there is also the possibility of additional charges relating to the modification if  within the initial five year period of the respective interest  we repurchase that interest at a value greater than required by the agreements prior to modification 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least annually 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant  or partnership level for indicators of permanent impairment 
judgments and estimates made related to long lived assets are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in historical resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
we have paid amounts to our insurance carrier that approximates the cost of claims known to date and we have accrued additional liabilities for our estimate of ultimate costs related to those claims 
we develop these estimates with our insurance providers and use historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure 
we validate our self insurance reserve by contracting with a third party actuary who utilizes estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on our historical trends 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient and additional expense may be recorded 
actual experience could also be more favorable than these estimates  resulting in expense reductions 

table of contents income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
changes in the tax contingency reserve result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could adversely affect our reported results 
new accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values determined at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas r 
under the new rule  we adopted sfas r on january  as permitted by sfas no 
 prior to january   pf chang s accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on pf chang s results of operations  although it will have no impact on pf chang s overall financial position 
the estimated impact of adopting sfas r for  relating to prior year grants only  will be approximately to million to million  net of tax 
this estimate includes costs related to unvested stock options and our current stock compensation programs 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
generally  the staff position requires companies to expense rental costs incurred during a construction period 
as permitted prior to the adoption of fsp  pf chang s capitalized rental costs during construction 
we adopted fsp on january  the financial impact of the adoption of the staff position is expected to range from approximately million to million in additional preopening rent expense during which may vary based on lease terms  store openings and length of construction period 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the 
table of contents period specific or cumulative effects of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and more broadly provides for exceptions regarding exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring during our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food  labor  insurance and utility costs 
additionally  a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage can affect our labor costs 
increases in workers compensation and health insurance costs also affect our labor costs 
purchase commitments payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
tenant improvement allowances contained within our operating leases are included in the preceding table in the year in which the location is expected to open 
in determining purchase obligations for this table we used our interpretation of the definition set forth in the sec final rule  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations  which states  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
in applying this definition  we have only included purchase obligations to the extent the failure to perform would result in formal recourse against pf chang s 
accordingly  certain procurement arrangements that indicate we are to purchase future items are included  but only to the extent they include a recourse provision for our failure to purchase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s a change in market prices exposes us to market risk related to our short term investments including restricted short term investments 
we held approximately million in available for sale marketable securities as of january  a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flows unless the securities were disposed of
