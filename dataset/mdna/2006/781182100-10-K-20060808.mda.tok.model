item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview ruby tuesday  inc rti  the company  we and or our owns and operates ruby tuesday casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday concept in selected domestic and international markets 
as of fiscal year end  we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants  located in states and the district of columbia 
we also own or of the equity of each of domestic franchisees  with the balance of the equity in these franchisees being owned by the various operators of the franchise businesses 
as of year end  these franchisees  which we refer to as franchise partnerships  operated restaurants 
we have a contractual right to acquire  at predetermined valuation formulas  the remaining equity of any or all of the franchise partnerships 
our other franchisees  domestic and international  operated restaurants 
in total rti s franchisees operate restaurants in states and puerto rico and foreign countries 
casual dining  the segment of the restaurant industry in which rti operates  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer the same or similar types of services and products as we do 
our industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local conditions  demographic trends  traffic patterns  and the types  numbers and locations of competing restaurants as well as overall marketing efforts 
there also is significant competition in the restaurant industry for management personnel and for attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for restaurants 
a key performance goal for us is to get more out of existing assets 
to measure our progress towards that goal  we focus on measurements we believe are critical to our growth and progress including  but not limited to  the following same restaurant sales a year over year comparison of sales volumes for restaurants that  in the current year  have been open at least months in order to remove the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing restaurants  and average restaurant volumes a per restaurant calculated annual average sales amount  which helps us gauge the continued development of our brand 
generally speaking  growth in average restaurant volumes in excess of same restaurant sales is an indication that newer restaurants are operating with sales levels in excess of the company system average and conversely  when the growth in average restaurant volumes is less than that of same restaurant sales  a general conclusion can be reached that newer restaurants are recording sales less than those of the existing system 
our goal is to increase same restaurant sales on average per year and to increase average restaurant volumes by  per year towards our long term goal of million in sales per restaurant per year 
we also have strategies to invest wisely in new restaurants as it relates to generating both higher sales as well as higher returns and to maintain the right capital structure to create value for our shareholders 
our historical performance in these areas is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a section 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal was a week year 
all other years discussed throughout this md a section contained weeks 
in fiscal  the rd week added million to restaurant sales and operating revenue and to diluted earnings per share in our consolidated statement of income 
we remind you that  in order to best obtain an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  including franchise partnerships and traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income and equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information which we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
ruby tuesday restaurants the table below presents the number of ruby tuesday concept restaurants at each fiscal year end from fiscal through fiscal fiscal year company owned franchise total during fiscal  we opened company owned ruby tuesday restaurants  and closed six restaurants 
during fiscal  we opened company owned ruby tuesday restaurants  acquired ruby tuesday restaurants as part of the acquisitions of four franchise partnership entities  and closed six restaurants 
our franchisees entered into development agreements with us whereby they committed to open a specified number of ruby tuesday restaurants in their assigned territories over a specific period of time 
pursuant to development agreements  ruby tuesday franchise restaurants domestic and international were opened during fiscal and ruby tuesday franchise restaurants domestic and five international were opened during fiscal rti s franchisees closed seven restaurants six domestic and one international in fiscal in addition to the ruby tuesday restaurants sold to the company in fiscal  rti s franchisees closed nine restaurants six domestic and three international during fiscal restaurant sales sales at ruby tuesday restaurants in fiscal grew over fiscal for company owned restaurants and for domestic and international franchise restaurants as explained below 
the tables presented below reflect ruby tuesday concept sales for the last five years  and other revenue information for the last three years 
ruby tuesday concept sales in millions fiscal year company owned a franchise a  b a during fiscal  previously franchised ruby tuesday restaurants were acquired by the company from franchisees 
b includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
other revenue information company restaurant sales in thousands company restaurant sales growth percentage franchise revenue in thousands a franchise revenue growth percentage total revenue in thousands total revenue growth percentage company same restaurant sales growth percentage company average restaurant volumes million million million company average restaurant volumes growth percentage a franchise revenue includes royalty  license and development fees paid to us by our franchisees  exclusive of support service fees of million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively  which are recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in franchise revenue in fiscal is due in part to the acquisition of previously franchised ruby tuesday restaurants by the company as noted above 
rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to growth in the number of restaurants  coupled with an increase in same restaurant sales and higher average restaurant volumes 
management attributes the increase in same restaurant sales to a combination of factors  including a higher check average  driven by an improved menu with slightly higher pricing and better quality products  and a positive response to our media advertising which has continued to evolve favorably since its introduction in the prior fiscal year 
rti s increase in company restaurant sales in fiscal is attributable to growth in the number of restaurants offset with a decrease in same restaurant sales and lower average restaurant volumes 
during the second quarter of fiscal  a decision was made to move away from couponing as a means of driving trial and traffic towards media advertising 
coupon redemptions totaled million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal while we believe that there were other operational and external factors which contributed to a poor same restaurant sales performance for fiscal  this decision is believed to be the key driver 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties generally of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is due in part to the acquisition of four franchise partnership entities in the prior fiscal year and temporarily reduced royalty rates for certain franchisees 
total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
the increase in fiscal franchise restaurant sales is due in part to the growth in restaurants in international and domestic markets and an increase in average restaurant volumes as a result of an increase in same restaurant sales  partially offset by the acquisition of four franchise partnerships during the prior year 
rti franchise sales decreased in fiscal the decrease is due in part to the acquisition of the four franchise partnership entities discussed above and a decrease in average restaurant volumes resulting from lower same restaurant sales for domestic franchise restaurants 
operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
all information is derived from our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report 
restaurant sales and operating revenue franchise revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative  net of support service fees equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises interest expense  net total operating costs and expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income pre tax income for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  advertising contained within selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  net  and decreased income from our equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises as discussed below 
these higher costs were offset by increases in same restaurant sales coupled with the growth in the number of restaurants and lower  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs and depreciation and amortization 
for fiscal  pre tax profit was million or of total revenue  as compared to million or of total revenue  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower average restaurant volumes driven by a decrease of in same restaurant sales at company owned restaurants  increased advertising costs and lower franchising revenue 
in addition  the decrease was due to increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  other restaurant operating costs  depreciation and amortization  and decreased income from our equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises as discussed below 
these higher costs were offset by the growth in the number of restaurants and lower  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs 
cost of merchandise cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to increased food costs as a result of burger enhancements such as wheat buns  whole leaf lettuce  apple wood smoked bacon  higher quality pickles and tomatoes  and other product enhancements such as increased portion sizes  and an extended salad bar selection 
cost of merchandise  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in portion sizes for certain items as well as a shift to a new product for items such as chicken breasts  chicken tenders and wings  ribs and mashed potatoes  and the addition of new menu items  such as stackers and coconut shrimp  in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a benefit gained by purchasing bulk produce versus local produce and by the impact of decreased coupon redemptions 
payroll and related costs payroll and related costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue in fiscal due to the leveraging of certain costs as part of the same restaurant sales growth  labor cost efficiencies resulting from the rollout of a kitchen display system kds  the implementation of additional management tools  and improved tracking of hourly employees which resulted in reduced overtime  offset by higher management labor resulting from salary increases given at the beginning of fiscal and minimum wage increases in several states in which the company has restaurant operations 
for fiscal  payroll and related costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  due to labor cost efficiencies resulting from improved tracking of hourly employees which allowed for more efficient staffing  and new product additions that further reduced preparation times 
in addition  the decrease was attributed to reduced coupon redemptions in fiscal  which were million lower than the prior fiscal year and favorable health claims experience 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased in fiscal primarily due to higher utility costs  increased bad debt expenses associated with certain franchise notes receivable  higher closing expense due to a lease reserve established upon the closing of an unprofitable restaurant as part of market upgrading  and a million gain recognized in the prior year from the sale of our interest in rt northern illinois franchise  llc 
rt northern illinois 
partially offsetting this increase is the impact of higher same restaurant sales without equivalent increases in other restaurant operating costs  many of which are somewhat fixed in nature 
for fiscal  other restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased primarily due to higher utility costs  including electricity and natural gas  higher rent and lease required expenses driven by lower average restaurant volumes coupled with the addition of the four franchise partnership entities during the year  higher closing expense due to a favorable lease adjustment in the prior fiscal year  and a loss recorded on our guarantee of the northern california franchise s revolving credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
additionally  the costs  many of which as noted above are somewhat fixed in nature  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased due to the loss of leverage resulting from lower same restaurant sales 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain resulting from the sale of our interest in rt northern illinois to rt midwest  a traditional franchise  during the second quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  decreased in fiscal primarily due to higher average restaurant volumes and reduced depreciation for older leased restaurants as initial leasehold improvements became fully depreciated during the current fiscal year 
for fiscal  depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  increased primarily due to lower average restaurant volumes  and accelerated depreciation on seven restaurants expected to be closed at the end of their lease terms 
two of the seven restaurants with accelerated depreciation closed during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher advertising expense as the company began utilizing cable television advertising at the beginning of fiscal in addition to its previous network television advertising 
in addition  the company began sponsoring certain events as part of its overall marketing strategy during fiscal advertising costs increased million in fiscal to million  net of franchise marketing reimbursements 
bonus expense was also higher in fiscal due to higher attainment of company performance goals 
these increases were partially offset by lower training payroll due to lower management turnover and efficiencies created by kds  and lower supervisor labor due to leveraging of higher sales volumes 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased 
the increase was attributable to higher advertising expenditures as we transitioned towards television advertising as our primary form of marketing with less emphasis on the use of coupons which are recorded as a reduction of restaurant revenues and a reduction in franchise support service fee income due to the purchase of four franchise partnership entities during the current year and lower same restaurant sales for the franchise partnerships  offset by a decrease in bonus expense to adjust for lower bonuses 
the transition towards television advertising began during the second quarter of fiscal advertising costs increased million in fiscal to million  net of franchise marketing reimbursements 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated franchises for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchisees decreased to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of advertising costs as the domestic franchise system began participating in our national media advertising program  which began including national cable covering the entire country at the beginning of this fiscal year  higher interest expense due to increased debt associated with new restaurant openings and higher interest rates on variable debt  higher utility costs  coupled with the acquisition of a prior owned franchise partnership in the second quarter of fiscal for fiscal  our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated franchises decreased to million from million in fiscal  due to the acquisition of our tampa franchise  which had been a owned franchise  coupled with the sale of our ownership interest in rt northern illinois and lower same restaurant sales for certain of our owned franchise partnerships during the year 
net interest expense net interest expense increased million in fiscal primarily due to higher debt outstanding resulting from the company acquiring million shares of its stock during the year under our on going share repurchase program 
in addition  the increase is attributable to higher interest rates on variable rate debt and the acquisition of franchise entities during the prior fiscal year  which resulted in more interest expense due to additional higher rate debt and less interest income from domestic franchises 
for fiscal  net interest expense increased million primarily due to lower interest income on the franchise partnership notes receivable due to the acquisition of franchise entities during the year coupled with collections on the notes remaining 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal the change in the effective rate was primarily due to higher tax credits coupled with lower pre tax income  which resulted in our already increased tax credits having a greater impact on the overall tax rate 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  down from in fiscal  primarily for the same reasons 
liquidity and capital resources rti s cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity allow us to pursue our growth strategies and targeted capital structure 
accordingly  we have established certain well defined priorities for our operating cash flow invest wisely in new restaurants and maintain our commitment to high return  low risk growth to increase profitability  continue to make investments in our team members and our existing assets in order to provide superior guest and team satisfaction  and repurchase our common stock in order to maintain our target capital structure and return excess capital to our shareholders and provide further capital return to our shareholders through our dividend program  started in fiscal sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase in cash and short term investments we require capital principally for new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for acquisitions of franchisees 
we also require capital to pay dividends to our common stockholders and to repurchase our common stock 
property and equipment expenditures purchased with internally generated cash flows for fiscal   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire  directly and through our subsidiaries  the remaining member or limited partnership interests of four franchise partnerships  rt new york  the upstate new york buffalo area franchisee  rt tampa  rt northern california  and rt michiana  the southwest michigan and northern indiana franchisee 
these acquisitions added restaurants to the company 
shortly after the end of fiscal  we acquired the remaining partnership interests of rt orlando 
further acquisitions  particularly from franchisees in the eastern united states  may occur either during fiscal or thereafter 
capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be approximately to million based on our expectation that we will open approximately to company owned restaurants in fiscal also included are budgeted amounts for ongoing refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants and the enhancement of information systems 
we intend to fund capital expenditures for company owned restaurants with cash provided by operations 
we will spend million  plus assumed debt  as discussed above to acquire the orlando franchisee  which had been a franchise partnership

the franchise loan guarantee of million also shown in the table excludes the guarantee of million for construction to date on the restaurants being financed under the facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
off balance sheet arrangements since  our franchise partnerships have been offered a credit facility for which we provide a partial guarantee 
the current credit facility  which has been negotiated with various lenders  is a million credit facility to assist franchise partnerships with working capital and operational cash flow requirements 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on november  we amended and restated this credit facility with various lenders 
as sponsor of the credit facility  we serve as partial guarantor of the draws made on this revolving line of credit 
the credit facility expires on october  and allows for month individual franchise partnership loan commitments 
if desired  rti can increase the amount of the facility by up to million to a total of million or  reduce the amount of the facility 
the amount guaranteed under this program totaled million as of june  prior to july   rti also had an arrangement with a different third party lender whereby we could choose  in our sole discretion  to partially guarantee specific loans for new franchisee restaurant development the cancelled facility 
on july   rti terminated the cancelled facility and notified this third party lender that it would no longer enter into additional guarantee arrangements 
rti will honor the partial guarantees of the three loans to franchise partnerships that were in existence as of the termination of the credit facility 
should payments be required under the cancelled facility  rti has certain rights to acquire the operating restaurants after the third party debt is paid 
this program had remaining outstanding guarantees of million at june  also in july  rti entered into a new program  similar to the cancelled facility  with a different third party lender the franchise development facility 
under the franchise development facility  the company s potential guarantee liability is reduced  and the program includes better terms and lower rates for the franchise partnerships as compared to the cancelled facility 
rti has a guarantee of million outstanding under this program as of june  as consideration for providing these guarantees  we received million in fiscal as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and noted below  rti has certain divestiture guarantees with morrison fresh cooking  inc mfc and morrison health care  inc 
mhc which arose in in connection with the distribution of mfc subsequently acquired by piccadilly cafeterias  inc  or piccadilly and mhc subsequently acquired by compass group  plc  or compass businesses 
contingent liabilities resulting from these guarantees include payments due to mfc and mhc employees retiring under two non qualified defined benefit plans which existed at the time of the distribution the non qualified pension plans  or corresponding replacement plans established by mfc and mhc at the time of distribution  for their proportionate share of any accrued benefit that may have been earned under the non qualified pension plans as of the distribution date and for payments due on six named workers compensation claims 
additionally  as a sponsor of the morrison restaurants inc retirement plan the retirement plan  we  along with mfc and mhc  can be held responsible for benefits due to all of the retirement plan s participants 
as a result of the piccadilly bankruptcy discussed herein  the amounts we expect to pay represent of the total amounts due as we expect to share liabilities equally with mhc  which is also contingently liable 
during fiscal  we recorded a liability of million for the retirement plans collective divestiture guarantees for which mfc was originally responsible under the divestiture guarantee agreements  comprised of million related to the retirement plan the qualified plan and million in the aggregate attributable to the management retirement plan and the executive supplemental pension plan previously maintained by mfc the two nonqualified plans 
these amounts were determined in consultation with the plans actuary  and assumed no recovery from the bankruptcy proceeding 
as of june   we have received two partial settlements of the piccadilly bankruptcy  million in december and million in december we hope to recover further amounts upon final settlement of the bankruptcy  which is expected in fiscal the actual amount we may be ultimately required to pay could be lower if there is any further recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding  or could be higher if more valid participants are identified or if actuarial assumptions are ultimately proven inaccurate 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
our contingent liability relative to mhc is estimated to be million at june   and includes mhc s share of the piccadilly employee benefit plan liability  along with the amounts for which we would be liable relative to the employees of mhc 
we currently do not anticipate having to pay any amounts on behalf of mhc due to our perception of mhc s financial strength and accordingly no amounts have been recorded relative to our mhc contingent liability 
we have an employment agreement with samuel e 
beall  iii  whereby he has agreed to serve as chief executive officer of the company until june  in accordance with the agreement  mr 
beall is compensated at a base salary adjusted annually based on various company or market factors and is entitled to an annual bonus opportunity and a long term incentive compensation program  which currently includes stock option grants and life insurance coverage 
the employment agreement also provides for certain severance payments to be made in the event of a termination other than for cause  or a change in control  the circumstances of which are defined in the agreement 
as of june   the total of the potential liability for severance payments with regard to the employment agreement was approximately million 
pension plans funded status rti is a sponsor of the retirement plan along with mhc  which was spun off as a result of morrison restaurant inc s morrison fiscal spin off transaction 
mfc  which also had been spun off  was a sponsor of the retirement plan prior to piccadilly s bankruptcy  discussed below 
the retirement plan was established to provide retirement benefits to qualifying employees of morrison 
under the retirement plan  participants are entitled to receive benefits based upon salary and length of service 
the retirement plan was amended as of december   so that no additional benefits will accrue and no new participants will enter the retirement plan after that date 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  piccadilly announced on october  that it had filed for chapter protection under the united states bankruptcy code 
on march   piccadilly s assets and ongoing business operations were sold to a third party for million 
on march   rti filed a claim against piccadilly as part of the bankruptcy proceedings in the amount of approximately million 
subsequently  the company entered into a settlement agreement under which rti agreed to accept a million unsecured claim in exchange for the agreement of the creditors committee to allow such claims 
the settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court on october  in partial settlement of the piccadilly bankruptcy  rti received million in december and million in december the company hopes to recover a further amount upon final settlement of the bankruptcy 
no further recovery has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
the retirement plan s original three sponsors had agreed to voluntarily contribute such amounts as are necessary to provide assets sufficient to meet benefits to be paid to participants 
piccadilly  however  has not contributed to the retirement plan subsequent to its bankruptcy filing 
amounts payable to the retirement plan by piccadilly since that date have been split equally between rti and compass 
because we have integrated the piccadilly census data into our own  we no longer track the liability for mfc retirement plan benefits separately from the liability due rti participants 
our total contributions to the retirement plan approximated million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
rti contributions to the retirement plan for fiscal are projected to be million 
to the best of our knowledge  compass has made all required contributions 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  the assets and obligations attributable to mhc participants  as well as former mfc participants who were allocated to compass following piccadilly s bankruptcy  were spun out of the retirement plan and into a separate plan maintained by compass 
following the spin off  rti became the sole sponsor of the retirement plan 
rti also sponsors two additional pension plans  the executive supplemental pension plan and the management retirement plan 
although these plans are legally considered to be unfunded  the company does provide a source for the payment of benefits under these two plans in the form of company owned life insurance policies 
the cash value of these policies was million at june  the management retirement plan was amended effective june  such that no additional benefits would accrue and no new participants may enter the plan after that date 
mfc established successor pension plans at the time of its spin off from rti march for the benefit of eligible rti employees whose employment was being transferred to mfc 
as with the retirement plan  the ultimate amount of liability which rti will absorb relative to piccadilly s two nonqualified pension plans will not be known until the completion of piccadilly s bankruptcy proceedings 
we expect to have some liability to the mfc employees who had an accrued benefit under the rti unfunded pension plans at the time of the spin off 
based on estimates prepared with the assistance of our independent actuaries  we have recorded a liability of million on behalf of mfc participants relative to these two plans 
as with the retirement plan  the extent of any recovery in the bankruptcy proceeding is unknown at this time 
as of our march  measurement date  rti pension plans  including amounts recorded by rti for liabilities assumed for former mfc employees  had a total projected benefit obligation pbo of million  and an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million 
the combined fair value of plan assets as of the end of fiscal  including the company owned life insurance policies and a contribution of million made to the retirement plan after the measurement date but before june   was approximately million 
as a result of the underfunded status of the three plans relative to the combined pbo  we have recorded a million reduction to shareholders equity net of tax of million as of june  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time period over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at march  and at march  we believe our assumption of the expected rate of return on plan assets to be appropriate given the composition of plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
we will continue to use the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in fiscal assuming no further recoveries from the piccadilly bankruptcy  we expect pension expense to decrease by million in fiscal we do not believe that the underfunded status of the three rti pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in fiscal or in future years 
given current funding levels and discount rates  we anticipate making contributions to more fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five to ten years 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the three plans 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our annual budgets and outlook 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to rti s shareholders 
this policy has historically called for payment of semi annual dividends of per share 
in accordance with this policy  we paid dividends of million in fiscal because we are committed to returning an increasing amount of our excess capital to our shareholders and anticipate having sufficient free cash flow  beginning with fiscal  we plan to increase our semi annual dividend from to per share 
our first dividend was declared by our board of directors on july   payable august   to shareholders of record on july  the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain  however  at the discretion of the board of directors and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
additionally  our credit facilities contain certain limitations on the payment of dividends 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
restaurants open for less than five quarters are considered new and are excluded from our impairment review 
we believe this approach provides sufficient time to establish the presence of the restaurant in the market and build a customer base 
approximately of our restaurants have been open for less than five quarters and have not been evaluated for potential impairment 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least five quarters shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
in part due to the decision to transition marketing efforts from coupons to television and other similar forms of advertising  quarterly same restaurant sales for company owned ruby tuesday restaurants were negative for the five consecutive quarters immediately preceding the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
since that time  same restaurant sales were positive   and in the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
at june  we had restaurants that have been open more than five quarters with rolling month negative cash flows 
of these restaurants  only five have consistently had an annual negative cash flow amount in excess of  we recorded impairments on two of these five restaurants during fiscal and fiscal the other three restaurants are currently engaged in programs to improve operations  sales and profits 
each of these three restaurants has shown cash flow improvement in each quarter of the current fiscal year 
we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the other five restaurants that have been open more than five quarters with negative cash flows for the months ended june  and concluded that no impairment existed at three of these restaurants 
the other two restaurants had previously been impaired 
the combined month cash flow loss at the six negative cash flow restaurants for which no impairment had previously been recorded was approximately million 
should sales at these six and other restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful notes and interest income we follow a systematic methodology each quarter in our analysis of franchise and other notes receivable in order to estimate losses inherent at the balance sheet date 
a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio involves reviewing the following for each significant borrower terms including interest rate  original note date  payoff date  and principal and interest start dates  note amounts including the original balance  current balance  associated debt guarantees  and total exposure  and other relevant information including whether the borrower is making timely interest  principal  royalty and support payments  the borrower s debt coverage ratios  the borrower s current financial condition and sales trends  the borrower s additional borrowing capacity  and  as appropriate  management s judgment on the quality of the borrower s operations 
based on the results of this analysis  the allowance for doubtful notes is adjusted as appropriate 
no portion of the allowance for doubtful notes is allocated to guarantees 
in the event that collection is deemed to be an issue  a number of actions to resolve the issue are possible  including the purchase of the franchised restaurants by us or a replacement franchisee  modification to the terms of payment of franchise fees or note obligations  or a restructuring of the borrower s debt to better position the borrower to fulfill its obligations 
at june  the allowance for doubtful notes was million 
included in the allowance for doubtful notes is million allocated to the million of debt due from eight franchisees that have either reported coverage ratios below the required levels with certain of their third party debt  or reported ratios above the required levels but for an insufficient amount of time 
with the exception of amounts borrowed under the million credit facility for franchise partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information  the third party debt referred to above is not guaranteed by rti 
the company believes that payments are being made by these franchisees in accordance with the terms of these debts 
we recognize interest income on notes receivable when earned which sometimes precedes collection 
a number of our franchise notes have  since the inception of these notes  allowed for the deferral of interest during the first one to three years 
with one exception and in accordance with the terms of the note  all franchisees that issued outstanding notes to us are currently paying interest on these notes 
it is our policy to cease accruing interest income and recognize interest on a cash basis when we determine that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the same analysis noted above for doubtful notes is utilized in determining whether to cease recognizing interest income and thereafter record interest payments on the cash basis 
lease obligations the company leases a significant number of its restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and records the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
as of june   we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the future tax deductions attributable to our deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment fas r or the statement 
fas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the statement is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  fiscal for rti 
as of the effective date  rti will apply the statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and for awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for either recognition or pro forma disclosures under fas fas r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as required under current accounting rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
the amount of compensation expense associated with stock options anticipated to be unvested as of the date of required adoption is million 
of this amount million is expected to be recognized in fiscal the remainder will be recognized between fiscal and fiscal the impact of this statement on rti in fiscal and beyond will depend upon various factors  including  but not limited to  our future compensation strategy 
in fiscal  the company restructured its compensation programs to limit eligibility as to which team members can receive share based compensation 
we may further modify grants in fiscal and forward to include performance or market conditions and or shift a portion of the share based compensation to cash based incentive compensation 
assuming option grants in fiscal are similar to those in fiscal  the company estimates that the total impact of fas r in fiscal will be between and per share on a fully diluted basis 
the pro forma compensation costs presented in the table shown in note to our consolidated financial statements and in our prior filings have been calculated using a black scholes option pricing model  which is the model we plan to use upon adoption of fas r 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements fas 
fas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of the change 
fas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
fas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  it does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of fas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
this staff position is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and retrospective application is permitted but not required 
we have historically expensed rent costs incurred during the construction period 
accordingly  staff position fas is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb emerging issues task force issued issue eitf  how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
a consensus was reached that a company should disclose its accounting policy ie  gross or net presentation regarding presentation of taxes within the scope of eitf if taxes are significant  a company should disclose the amount of such taxes for each period for which an income statement is presented 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present company sales net of sales taxes and therefore do not expect any changes as a result of eitf in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal for rti  with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
known events  uncertainties and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility and maintaining the equivalent of an investment grade bond rating 
this strategy periodically allows us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended june   we repurchased million shares of rti common stock for a total purchase price of million 
the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased  as of june   is approximately million 
this amount reflects a million share authorization approved by our board of directors on january  to the extent not funded with cash from operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  additional repurchases  if any  may be funded by borrowings on the credit facility 
franchising and development agreements our agreements with franchise partnerships allow us to purchase an additional equity interest for a specified price 
we have chosen to exercise that option in situations in which we expect to earn a return similar to or better than that which we expect when we invest in new restaurants 
during fiscal and fiscal  we did not exercise our right to acquire an additional equity interest in any franchise partnerships 
we currently have a ownership in seven of our franchise partnerships which collectively operated ruby tuesday restaurants at june those same agreements with the franchise partnerships allow us to purchase all remaining equity interests beyond the or we already own  for an amount to be calculated based upon a predetermined valuation formula 
on july   we acquired the remaining partnership interests of rt orlando bringing our equity interest in that franchise to 
at the time of acquisition rt orlando operated ruby tuesday restaurants 
we expect to sell two existing operating restaurants  and lease a third  to an existing owned franchise partnership early in fiscal we may choose to sell existing restaurants or exercise our rights to acquire an additional equity interest in franchise partnerships in fiscal and beyond 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
fiscal year rti s fiscal will contain weeks and end on june  fiscal year contained weeks  while fiscal years and each contained weeks 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
management s outlook we continue to strategically position the company for growth through the continuing emphasis on our ruby tuesday brand and our franchise programs 
our mission can best be described as quality 
passion 
pride 
by remaining intently focused on delivering products representing uncompromising quality and freshness  and empowering our teams with a passion to take great care of our guests and pride in their work and our company  we believe we will be able to accomplish our mission 
our strategies to drive future value are to get more out of existing assets  invest wisely in new restaurants  and maintain the right capital structure to create value for our shareholders 
we believe that these strategies support our goal to grow eps in the to range per year long term  while providing for our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders 
as part of that commitment  we plan to increase our semi annual dividend from cents per share to per share beginning with fiscal as previously discussed  the first such dividend was declared by our board of directors on july  our goals are to increase same restaurant sales on average per year and increase average unit volumes by  per year 
our current sales strategies designed to help us attain those goals are to enhance our salad bar display with new lettuce choices and more fresh offerings of vegetables and salads  increase our focus on uncompromising freshness and quality through new and or improved menu offerings  increase off premise sales through continued emphasis on the existing take out business and rolling out a new catering program  and upgrading our quality beverage program through fresher  higher quality ingredients  recipes  glassware  training  designated bar managers and technology 
despite these programs  we don t anticipate achieving our same restaurant sales growth goal in fiscal due to reductions in consumer spending in our current economy 
we believe the above mentioned programs will help mitigate any negative impact of this economic downturm and ultimately help us achieve our same restaurant sales goals 
in the franchising area  as part of our longer term plan to increase our company owned growth in the eastern united states  we anticipate continuing to explore the benefits of acquiring some of our franchisees in that area as well as selected additional areas 
as previously mentioned  we bought the remaining membership interests of rt orlando early in fiscal we continue to look for potential new  primarily traditional  franchisees in targeted areas in the united states and around the world 
as rti s franchise system continues to shift towards traditional franchise arrangements  we expect that the level of financial support to be provided through programs such as the million franchise partner credit facility will be reduced 
see special note regarding forward looking information below 
special note regarding forward looking information the foregoing section contains various forward looking statements  which represent the company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including one or more of the following future financial performance and restaurant growth both company owned and franchised  future capital expenditures  future borrowings and repayment of debt  payment of dividends  stock repurchase  and restaurant and franchise acquisitions 
the company cautions the reader that a number of important factors and uncertainties could  individually or in the aggregate  cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the following changes in promotional  couponing and advertising strategies  guests acceptance of changes in menu items  changes in our guests disposable income  consumer spending trends and habits  mall traffic trends  increased competition in the restaurant market  weather conditions in the regions in which company owned and franchised restaurants are operated  guests acceptance of the company s development prototypes  laws and regulations affecting labor and employee benefit costs  costs and availability of food and beverage inventory  the company s ability to attract qualified managers  franchisees and team members  changes in the availability and cost of capital  impact of adoption of new accounting standards  effects of actual or threatened future terrorist attacks in the united states  significant fluctuations in energy prices  and general economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our options for the rate are the base rate or libo rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate is defined to be the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the applicable margin for the libo rate based option is a percentage ranging from to 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of million per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
