in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical facts  including  among others  statements regarding our future financial position  business strategy  projected levels of growth  projected costs and projected financing needs  are forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of several important factors including  without limitation  a history of losses  competitive factors  uncertainties inherent in government contracting  concentration of business with a small number of clients  the ability to service debt  substantial leverage  material weaknesses in our internal controls and our disclosure controls  energy costs  the interest rate environment  one time events and other factors more fully described in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the forward looking statements made in this report relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made 
because forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified  you should not rely upon forward looking statements as predictions of future events 
except as required by applicable law  including the securities laws of the united states  and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  we do not plan and assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements contained herein after the date of this report  whether as a result of any new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debt  derivatives  accounting for income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  and goodwill 
revenue recognition  profit recognition and allowance for bad debts data center revenues consist of monthly recurring fees for colocation  exchange point  and managed and professional services fees 
these revenues also include monthly rental income for unconditioned space in our miami facility 
revenues from colocation and exchange point services  as well as rental income for unconditioned space  are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation 
effective april   we revised the estimated life of customer installations from to months 
we have determined that this change in accounting estimate does not and will not have a material impact on net earnings in current and future periods 
managed and professional services fees are recognized in the period in which the services are 
table of contents provided 
revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured and no remaining performance obligation exists 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when more than one element such as equipment  installation and colocation services are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on acceptable fair value allocation methodologies  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately  or in cases when the item is not sold separately  by the using other acceptable objective evidence 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
as of march  and  accounts receivable amounted to and million  respectively 
these amounts are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  each year 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
customer contracts generally require us to meet certain service level commitments 
if we do not meet the required service levels  we may be obligated to provide credits  usually a month of free service 
such credits  to date  have been insignificant 
derivatives we have  in the past  used financial instruments  including swaps and cap agreements  to manage exposures to movements in interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments modifies our exposure to these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
however  our senior convertible notes  due june  contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation from the notes 
we recognize these derivatives as liabilities on our balance sheet and measure them at their estimated fair value  and recognize changes in their estimated fair value in earnings in the period of change 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives had an estimated fair value of approximately million as of march   an estimated fair value of approximately million as of march  the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
the closing price of our common stock increased to as of march  from per share as of march  as a result  during the year ended march   we recognized an expense of million due to the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
with the assistance of a third party  we estimate the fair value of our embedded derivatives using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
over the life of the notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the past twelve months of 
if an active trading market develops for the notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may in the future be able to use actual market data to adjust the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives 
such adjustment could be significant and would be accounted for prospectively 

table of contents accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on the available objective evidence  management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period in which such determination is made if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  amounting to approximately million  begin to expire in on april   terremark holdings  inc merged with amtec  inc 
we determined that the net operating losses generated prior to the amtech merger may have been limited by federal tax laws that impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
such a limitation is effective for a five year period 
as a result  for the year ended march   we determined that we are no longer limited in utilizing net operating losses generated prior to the amtec merger 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
in september  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 income tax consequences of issuing convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature eitf 
eitf concludes that i the issuance of convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that should be accounted for as a temporary difference and ii the establishment of the deferred tax liability for the basis difference should result in an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
we believe that the underlying concepts in eitf should be similarly applied to debt for which an embedded derivative has been bifurcated under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
this application results in the recognition of deferred taxes upon issuance for the temporary differences existing on both the debt instrument and the embedded derivative 
subsequent changes in fair value of embedded derivative will result in remeasurement of the related deferred tax account 
the guidance in this issue should be implemented by retrospective application in financial statements for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  early application is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
our convertible debt has embedded derivatives that are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
our retrospective application of eitf changes the composition of certain deferred tax disclosure items as of march  and did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the number of additional customer contracts  profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the 
table of contents asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment  net and identifiable intangible assets  totaled approximately and million  respectively 
for the year ended march   we recognized impairment charges amounting to approximately  we recognized no impairment charge for the year ended stock based compensation we use the intrinsic value method to account for our employee stock based compensation plans 
under this method  compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant  between the fair value of our shares and the option s exercise price 
we account for stock based compensation to non employees using the fair value method 
on march   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the vesting  effective as of march   of all unvested stock options previously granted under our stock option and executive incentive compensation plans 
the options affected by this accelerated vesting had exercise prices ranging from to 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  options to purchase approximately  shares became immediately exercisable 
all other terms of these options remain unchanged 
we will adopt financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised sfas r  share based payment as of april   and will then recognize compensation expense prospectively for all future stock based grants 
the decision of the compensation committee to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that otherwise would be recorded starting with the fiscal quarter ended june  we have recognized approximately  before tax of compensation expense during the quarter ended march  as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of the options  but will not be required to recognize future compensation expenses for the accelerated options under fas r unless we make modifications to the options  which is not anticipated 
the future compensation expense that will be avoided  based on our implementation date for sfas r on april   is approximately   and  in the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
we  however  expect future stock based compensation grants to have a significant impact on our result of operations 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather  are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with its respective carrying amount 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step involves a comparison of the implied fair value to the carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
as of march  and  our goodwill totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the carrying amount of the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in conjunction with i the acquisition of a corporation holding rights to develop and manage facilities catering to the telecommunications industry and ii the acquisition of dedigate  nv  a managed host service provider in europe 
we performed the annual tests for impairment for the rights to develop and manage facilities catering to the telecommunications industry in the quarters ended march  and  and concluded that there were no impairments 
since dedigate  nv was acquired in august  we will perform the required annual test impairment for dedigate related intangibles in the 
table of contents quarter ended september  for the year ended march   we recognized an impairment expense of approximately  results of operations results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenue 
the following charts provide certain information with respect to our revenues for the year ended march  us operations outside us data center construction contract and fee revenue data center revenues consist of for the year ended march  colocation managed and professional services exchange point services other technology infrastructure buildouts total data center revenues the increase in data center revenues is mainly due to both an increase in our deployed customer base and an expansion of services to existing customers 
our deployed customer base increased from customers as of march  to customers as of march  included in revenues and customer count are the results of dedigate  nv  a european managed dedicated hosting provider  which we acquired on august  data center revenues consist of colocation services  such as licensing of space and provisioning of power  exchange point services  such as peering and cross connects  and managed and professional services  such as network management  managed web hosting  outsourced network operating center noc services  network monitoring  procurement and installation of equipment and procurement of connectivity  managed router services  secure information services  technical support and consulting 
during the year ended march   we completed three technology infrastructure build outs under us federal government contracts that included the procurement  installation and configuration of colocation specialized equipment at the nap of the americas facility in miami 
under the completed contract method  we recognized approximately million as technology infrastructure build out revenue upon delivery and formal acceptance by the customer 
as a result  the percentage of data center revenues derived from the us government decreased to for the year ended march  from for the year ended march  
table of contents our utilization of total net colocation space increased to as of march  from as of march  our utilization of total net colocation space represents the percentage of space billed versus total space available for customers 
the increase in managed and professional services is mainly due to increases of approximately million in managed services provided under government contracts  million in managed services generated by dedigate and million in equipment resales 
we also earned million in the year ended march  for professional services related to feasibility and network engineering studies 
the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of an increase in orders from both existing and new customer growth as reflected by the growth in our customer count and utilization of space as discussed above 
the increase in exchange point services is mainly due to an increase in cross connects billed to customers 
cross connects billed to customers increased to  as of march  from  as of march  we anticipate an increase in revenue from colocation  exchange point and managed services as we add more customers to our network of naps  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
we anticipate that the percentage of revenue derived from public sector customers will fluctuate depending on the timing of exercise of expansion options under existing contracts and the rate at which we sell services to the public sector 
we anticipate that public sector revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
construction contracts and fees 
we have no construction projects currently in process and we did not recognize revenue from construction contracts for the year ended march  we recognized million for the year ended march  related to one construction contract completed during that period 
during the year ended march   we also collected management fees from tecota  the entity that then owned the building in which the nap of the americas is located  equal to approximately  these management fees are non existent in the current period due to the acquisition of tecota on december  data center operations expenses 
excluding million in costs incurred related to technology infrastructure build outs  data center expenses increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  data center operations expenses consist mainly of operations personnel  procurement of connectivity and equipment  technical and colocation space rental  electricity  chilled water  insurance  property taxes  and security services 
the increase is the result of increases of million in managed services costs  million in personnel costs  million in tecota facility costs  million in electricity and chilled water costs  and in facilities maintenance costs  offset by a decrease of million in technical and colocation space costs 
in connection with the three completed technology infrastructure build outs during the year ended march   we incurred million in direct costs  including the purchase of specialized equipment 
under the completed contract method  these contract costs were deferred until our delivery and acceptance by the customer in the quarters ended december  and march  the increase in managed service costs include a million increase in the procurement of connectivity and a million increase in the cost of equipment resales 
the increase in connectivity costs is mainly due to an increase in revenues from managed services and new bandwidth costs for interconnecting our internet exchange point facilities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of an increase in orders from both existing and new customers as reflected by the growth in our customer count and utilization of space as discussed above 
the increase in personnel costs is mainly due to an increase in operations and engineering staff levels 
our staff levels increased to employees as of march  from as of march  the increase in the number of employees is mainly attributable to the hiring of personnel to work under existing and anticipated customer contracts  the expansion of operations in the madrid nap  the brazil nap and nap west  and the acquisition of dedigate 
the increase in power and chilled water costs is mainly due an increase in power utilization and chilled water consumption as a result of customer and colocation space growth 

table of contents the decrease in technical and colocation space costs is the result of the elimination of million in technical space rental costs as a result of the acquisition of tecota  offset by million in new leases in madrid  frankfurt  london  herndon virginia  hong kong and singapore 
we also have new leases in gent and amsterdam as a result of the acquisition of dedigate 
construction contract expenses 
there was no construction activity during the year ended march  construction contract expenses were  for the year ended march  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  professional service fees  travel  rent  and other general corporate expenses 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in professional fees and  in personnel costs 
the increase in personnel costs is mainly due to a stock based compensation charge of approximately  as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of employee stock options whose payroll related expenses are included in general and administrative expenses 
the increase in professional services is mainly due to additional audit and consulting fees resulting from our sarbanes oxley compliance work efforts 
going forward  we expect our accounting and consulting fees  and general and administrative expenses  to remain stable as we enter into the third year of our sarbanes oxley compliance program 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the most significant components of sales and marketing are payroll  sales commissions and promotional activities 
payroll and sales commissions increased by million mainly due an increase in staff levels  which is consistent with our increase in bookings 
our sales and marketing staff levels increased to employees as of march  from as of march  depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase is mainly due to the acquisition of tecota  the entity that owns the building that houses the nap of the americas 
impairment of long lived assets 
during the year ended march   we wrote off  related to equipment that was considered obsolete 
we did not have any impairment of long lived assets during the year ended march  change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
our senior convertible notes due june  contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation from the senior convertible notes 
we recognize these embedded derivatives as a liability in our balance sheet  measure them at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives had a march  estimated fair value of million and a march  estimated fair value of million 
the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives increases as the price of our common stock increases and decreases as the price of our common stock decreases 
the closing price of our common stock increased to on march  from as of march  as a result  during the year ended march   we recognized a loss of million from the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
for the year ended march   we recognized a gain of million due to the change in value of our embedded derivatives 
over the life of the senior convertible notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock of as of march  over the past twelve months 
if a market develops for our senior convertible notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may be able to use future market data to adjust our historical volatility by other factors such as trading volume 
as a result  the 
table of contents estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives could be significantly different 
any such adjustment would be made prospectively 
gain on debt restructuring and conversion 
during the year ended march   as a result of the extinguishment of notes payable and convertible debentures  we recognized a gain totaling million  representing the recognition of the unamortized balance of a debt restructuring deferred gain and the write off of debt issuance costs  net of an early redemption premium payment 
interest expense

interest income increased million to million for the year ended march  from approximately  for the year ended march  this increase was due to available cash balances as a result of the march  sale of  shares of our common stock 
net loss 
net loss for our reportable segments was as follows for the year ended march  data center operations real estate services excluding the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative  and the gain on debt restructuring and conversion  the net loss from data center operations increased million to million for the year ended march  when compared to million of the year ended march  the increase in our net loss is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately million  offset by a decrease in our net loss of approximately million 
the net loss from data center operations is primarily the result of insufficient revenues to cover our operating and interest expenses 
we will generate net losses until we reach required levels of monthly revenues

on december   we purchased tecota  the entity that owns the  square feet building in which the nap of the americas is housed 
prior to this acquisition  we leased  square feet of the building 
for comparative purposes  total space available to customers includes our estimate of available space to customers in the entire building for both march  and the increase in exchange point services is mainly due to an increase in cross connects billed to customers 
cross connects billed to customers increased to  as of march  from  as of march  driven by growth in our customer base and in the number of cross connects per customer 
the increase in managed and professional services is mainly due to an increase of approximately million in managed services provided under us federal government contracts 
we anticipate an increase in revenue from colocation exchange point and managed and professional services as we add more customers  sell additional services to existing customers and introduce new products 
table of contents and services 
we anticipate that the percentage of revenue derived from federal government customers will fluctuate depending on the timing of exercise of expansion options under existing contracts and the rate at which we sell additional services to the public sector 
construction contracts and fees 
construction contract revenue increased  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  we completed one construction contract in the year ended march   and as of that date  we have no construction contracts in process 
due to our opportunistic approach to our construction business  we expect revenues from construction contracts to significantly fluctuate year to year

in connection with the three completed technology infrastructure build outs  we incurred million in direct costs  including the purchase of specialized equipment 
under the completed contract method  these contract costs were deferred until our delivery to  and acceptance by  the customer in the quarters ended december  and march  the increase in personnel costs is mainly due to an increase in operations and engineering staff levels 
our staff levels increased to employees as of march  from as of march   which resulted in a million increase in base payroll and relocation expenses of approximately  the increase in employees is mainly attributable to the hiring of personnel with the required security clearances to work under existing and anticipated government contracts 
incentive bonuses expense totaled approximately  during the year ended march  there were no incentive bonuses in the year ended march  the increase in rent expense is mainly due to new leases in brazil and spain and the leasing of additional space in the building where the nap of the americas is housed for nine months ended december  as a result of our december  acquisition of tecota  we will no longer have rent expense related to this facility 
because of the july opening of our facilities in california  we recorded in the year ended march  our first full year of rent expense 
the increase in the procurement of connectivity is due to an increase in services provided by us to the us federal government 
we anticipate that some data center expenses  principally electricity  chilled water  and costs related to managed services will increase as we provide additional services to existing customers and introduce new products and services 
personnel costs will also increase as we continue to increase our team of employees with government security clearances in anticipation of additional us federal government contracts 
construction contract expenses 
construction contract expenses decreased  in the year ended march  to  from  for the year ended march  the increase is proportionately lower than the increase in construction revenues due to better margins

change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
our senior convertible notes due june  contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation from the senior convertible notes 
we recognize these embedded derivatives as a liability in our balance sheet  measure them at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives had an initial estimated fair value of approximately and a march  estimated fair value of approximately the embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock 
the closing price of our common stock decreased to on march  from per share as of the initial valuation date 
as a result  during the year ended march   we recognized a million gain from the change in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
over the life of the senior convertible notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives increases as the price of our common stock increases 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock of as of march  over the past year 
if a market develops for our senior convertible notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may be able to use in the future market data to adjust our historical volatility by other factors such as trading volume and our estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives could be significantly different 
any such adjustment would be made prospectively 
during the year ended march   we did not have any embedded derivatives 
gain on debt restructuring and conversion 
during the year ended march   as a result of the extinguishment of notes payable and convertible debentures  we recognized a gain totaling million  representing the recognition of the unamortized balance of a debt restructuring deferred gain and the write off of debt issuance costs  net of an early redemption premium payment 
during the year ended march   we recognized a non cash gain of million related to financing transactions whereby million of our construction payables plus million in accrued interest was converted to  shares of our common stock with a million market value upon conversion 
interest expense 
during the year ended march   interest expense increased  from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  this increase was due to additional debt incurred for the december  acquisition of tecota  partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate of our borrowings 
net loss 
our net loss decreased from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the decrease is mainly due to the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative of million for the year ended march  the net loss is primarily the result of insufficient revenues to cover our operating and interest expenses 
we expect to generate net losses until we reach required levels of monthly revenues 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity we have incurred losses from operations in each quarter and annual period since our merger with amtec  inc although cash used in operations for the year ended march  and was approximately million and million  respectively  we generated approximately  in cash from operations in the quarter ended march  as of march   our total liabilities were approximately million 
our working capital decreased from million  as of march   to million  as of march  as of march   our principal source of liquidity was our million in cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate that this cash  coupled with our anticipated cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and corporate overhead requirements in connection with our currently identified business objectives 
our projected revenues and cash flows depend on several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the rate at which we provide services  the timing of exercise of expansion options by customers under existing contracts  the rate at which new services are sold to the government sector and the commercial sector  the ability to retain the customer base  the willingness and timing of potential customers in outsourcing the housing and management of their technology infrastructure to us  the reliability and cost effectiveness of our services and our ability to market our services 
indebtedness on december   we purchased the remaining equity interests of tecota that were not owned by us and tecota became our wholly owned subsidiary 
tecota owns the building in which the nap of the americas is housed 
we refer to this building as the nap of the americas building 
in connection with this purchase  we paid approximately million for the equity interests and repaid an approximately million mortgage to which the nap of the americas building was subject 
we financed the purchase and repayment of the mortgage from two sources 
we obtained a million first mortgage loan from citigroup global markets realty corp  million of the proceeds of which are restricted and can only be used to fund customer related improvements made to the nap of the americas in miami 
simultaneously  we issued senior secured notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to million and sold  shares of our common stock valued at million to the falcon investors 
the citigroup million loan is collateralized by a first mortgage on the nap of the americas building and a security interest in all existing building improvements  certain of our deposit accounts and any cash flows generated from customers by virtue of their activity at the nap of the americas building 
the mortgage loan matures in february and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of a and b libor plus as of march  
in addition  if an event of default occurs under the mortgage loan agreement  we must pay interest at a default rate equal to per annum in excess of the rate otherwise applicable under the mortgage loan agreement on any amount we owe to the lenders but have not paid when due until that amount is paid in full 
the terms of the mortgage loan agreement require us to pay annual rent of million 
the senior secured notes are collateralized by substantially all of our assets other than the nap of the americas building  including the equity interests in our subsidiaries  bear cash interest at per annum and payment in kind interest at per annum  and mature in march in the event we achieve specified leverage ratios  the interest rate applicable to the senior secured notes will be reduced to but will be payable in cash only 
overdue payments under the senior secured notes bear interest at a default rate equal to per annum in excess of the rate of interest then borne by the senior secured notes 
our obligations under the senior secured notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries 
we may redeem some or all of the senior secured notes for cash 
if we redeem the notes before december  or during the six month period commencing on december   june   or december   the redemption price equals    and  respectively  of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date 
after june   the redemption price equals of their principal amounts 
also  if there is a change in control  the holders of 
table of contents these notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
our mortgage loan and our senior secured notes include numerous covenants imposing significant financial and operating restrictions on our business 
the covenants place restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur more debt  pay dividends  redeem or repurchase our stock or make other distributions  make acquisitions or investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others  dispose of assets or use asset sale proceeds  create liens on our assets  and extend credit 
also  a change in control without the prior consent of the lenders could allow the lenders to demand repayment of the loan 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the mortgage loan and the senior secured notes can be affected by events beyond our control 
our failure to comply with the obligations in the mortgage loan and the senior secured notes could result in an event of default under the mortgage loan and the senior secured notes  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of the indebtedness or other indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in june  we privately placed million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due june  to qualified institutional buyers 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually  on each december and june and are convertible at the option of the holders at per share 
we utilized a portion of the net proceeds of million to pay approximately million of outstanding loans and convertible debt 
the notes are unsecured obligations and rank pari passu with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness  senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness  and rank junior to any future secured indebtedness 
if there is a change in control  the holders of the senior convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if a change of control occurs and at least of the consideration for our common stock consists of cash  the holders of the senior convertible notes may elect to receive the greater of the repurchase price described above or the total redemption amount 
the total redemption amount will be equal to the product of x the average closing prices of our common stock for the five trading days prior to the announcement of the change of control and y the quotient of  divided by the applicable conversion price of the senior convertible notes  plus a make whole premium of per  of principal if the change of control takes place before december   reducing to per  of principal if the change of control takes place between june  and december  if we issue a cash dividend on our common stock  we will pay contingent interest to the holders equal to the product of the per share cash dividend and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each holder s note 
we may redeem some or all of the senior convertible notes for cash at any time on or after june  if the closing price of our common shares has exceeded of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date we mail the redemption notice

 income tax consequences of issuing convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature eitf 
eitf concludes that i the issuance of convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that should be accounted for as a temporary difference and ii the establishment of the deferred tax liability for the basis difference should result in an adjustment to additional paid in capital

table of contents ties 
this application results in the recognition of deferred taxes upon issuance for the temporary differences existing on both the debt instrument and the embedded derivative 
subsequent changes in fair value of embedded derivative will result in remeasurement of the related deferred tax account 
the guidance in this issue should be implemented by retrospective application in financial statements for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  early application is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not been issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes creates a market risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on the price and volatility of our common stock  however  we do not expect significant changes in the near term in the one year historical volatility of our common stock used to calculate the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
other factors being equal  as of march   the table below provides information about the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes and 
table of contents the effect that changes in the price of our common stock are expected to have on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives estimated fair value of price per share of common stock embedded derivatives our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates results from the variable rate of our mortgage loan  as an increase in interest rates would result in lower earnings and increased cash outflows 
the interest rate on our mortgage loan is payable at variable rates indexed to libor 
the effect of each increase in the libor rate on our mortgage loan at march  would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately  based on the yield curve published by the us department of the treasury and other available information  we project interest expense on our variable rate debt to increase approximately    and  for the years ended march    and  respectively 
our senior convertible notes and our senior secured notes have fixed interest rates and  accordingly  are not exposed to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
however  the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable approximations of their fair value 
as noted above  the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives increases as the price of our common stock increases 
these changes in estimated fair value will affect our results of operations but will not impact our cash flows 
to date  over of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
in the future  a larger portion of our revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  future operating results or cash flows could be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot conclude that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs rise  we have the ability to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
