overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety services to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we provide technology and services that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety and clinical data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic services cardiac safety services or expert ecg services and a leading provider of technology and services that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing using our clinical data management products and services 
our solutions improve the accuracy  timeliness and efficiency of trial set up  data collection from sites worldwide  data interpretation  and new drug  biologic and device application submissions 
we offer cardiac safety services  which are utilized by clinical trial sponsors and clinical research organizations cros during the conduct of clinical trials  including comprehensive thorough qtc studies 
services may be provided through the digital ecg franchise program  which offers a unique approach designed to address the growing capacity demands for ert s ecg services through partnerships with sponsors that desire dedicated resources within ert to address specific levels of cardiac safety monitoring transactions 
additionally  we offer the licensing and  at the client s option  hosting of our proprietary clinical data management software products and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of our proprietary clinical data management software products 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenue consists of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
cost of licenses consists primarily of applications service provider asp fees for those clients that choose hosting  the cost of producing compact disks and related documentation and royalties paid to third parties in connection with their contributions to our product development 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety services and the cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services 
cost of cardiac safety services consists primarily of direct costs related to our centralized cardiac safety services and includes wages  
back to contents depreciation and other direct operating costs 
cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services consists primarily of wages  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs related to our consulting and client support functions 
cost of site support consists primarily of wages  cardiac safety equipment rent and depreciation  related supplies  cost of equipment sold  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and commissions paid to sales personnel  travel expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and direct costs for our finance  administrative  corporate information technology  legal and executive management functions  in addition to professional service fees and corporate insurance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages paid to our product development staff  costs paid to outside consultants and direct costs associated with the development of our technology products 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 
our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our revenues are allocated among our geographic segments based upon the profit split transfer pricing methodology 
the international net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues reflect the application of the change in transfer pricing methodology  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  as if the changes were in effect as of january  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form k for a detailed discussion of revenue recognition among the geographic segments 
results of operations executive overview was characterized by uncertainty in the clinical research and drug development industry  due in part to evolving regulatory guidance concerning cardiac safety 
regulatory bodies  such as the united states food and drug administration fda and the international conference on harmonization ich  provide guidance on the clinical trial process 
this guidance can have a significant influence on the decisions made by our clients and potential clients regarding the use of our services 
we believe that regulatory uncertainty delayed new contract signings and extended the time for initiation of new studies 
we believe that our results of operations for were adversely affected as a result of this uncertainty 
revenue  net income and operating cash flow for the year all decreased substantially as compared to because we believed that the adverse impact of the regulatory uncertainty was temporary  we did not reduce our infrastructure which led to lower gross margins and operating income in as compared to on may   the international committee on harmonization ich ratified and recommended implementation step of the cardiac safety monitoring guidance provided in ich e the clinical evaluation of qt qtc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non antiarrhythmic drugs 
the guidance confirmed previous guidance reinforcing the need for routine cardiac safety testing as well as thorough qtc testing for all compounds entering the blood stream commencing early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials  as well as testing for all compounds in phase iii prior to submission for approval 
we believe that the ich e guidance has  to some extent  alleviated the regulatory uncertainty that has existed 
we announced record bookings of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of we believe that the higher level of bookings in the third and fourth quarters of  as compared to the first and second quarters of  was partially in response to the issuance of the ich e guidance 
the majority of the revenues related to the third and fourth quarter bookings will occur in and beyond 
our manual processing of ecgs includes manually derived measurements  using our on screen  high resolution caliper placement system  which are later interpreted by a cardiologist 
drug sponsors have begun to shift certain studies towards semi automated processing allowing more competitors to compete with us and  as a result  we offer semi automated processing services at reduced pricing to maintain our market share 
during  we purchased approximately million shares of our stock for approximately million under a stock buy back program authorized by our board of directors

back to contents the following table presents costs of revenues as a percentage of related net revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues year ended december  increase decrease cost of licenses cost of services cardiac safety technology consulting and training software maintenance total cost of services cost of site support total costs of revenues operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development license revenues decreased primarily due to a decline in the number of licenses sold and a decrease in the average license revenue for each license sold 
the decrease in the average license revenue was largely the result of a change in the mix of the type of licenses sold and the number of users for each license 
the decrease in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to a decrease in transactions performed and a decrease in average revenue per transaction 
the decrease in sales volume in was partially attributable to a slowdown in contract signings in the second half of and the first half of  delays in certain studies as well as a decrease in comprehensive thorough qtc studies 
thorough qtc studies are typically of large volume and of short duration  with ecgs performed over a two to six month period 
as a result  revenues resulting from thorough qtc studies are more difficult to predict 
we believe that regulatory uncertainty delayed new contract signings and extended the time for initiation of new studies 
the decrease in average revenue per transaction was largely due to the impact of increased activity in franchise accounts and semi automated processing  which generally include lower fees per transaction than other studies  as well as competitive pricing adjustments 
technology consulting and training revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in consulting and configuration for clinical data management software products 
many of the license sales in required limited consulting services due to the nature of the licenses sold 
software maintenance revenues increased due to software licenses sold during and after  which increased the number of total active licenses and their related maintenance fees 
site support revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in the sale of cardiac safety equipment included an unusually large sale transaction as well as a decrease in revenue from the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
this was driven largely by a reduction in the average revenue per equipment unit due to competitive pricing in the cardiac safety services market 
the decrease in cost of licenses was primarily due to a royalty paid in to a third party software developer related to the sale of one of the perpetual licenses as well as a decrease in asp hosting fees 
the increase in cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was due to the decrease in perpetual license revenues which have very little incremental cost of sales  such that revenue reductions lead to minimal cost savings 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of cardiac safety revenues  was primarily due to an increase in labor  depreciation and increased facilities and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the past and expected future growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets set for the first half of that were not achieved  a reduction in amortization expense related to internal use software costs and a reduction in recruitment expenses 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
back to contents related to internal use software 
additionally  the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services was primarily due to a reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets set for the first half of that were unmet  a reduction in third party consulting costs that was partially attributable to the decrease in related revenue  higher employee benefits costs in in connection with stock option exercises and a decrease in other labor costs 
the increase in the cost of technology consulting and training services as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues was due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was due primarily to an increase in depreciation and rental costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the past and expected growth in site support activities  including the addition of new dedicated site support facilities in both the us and uk during the second half of the increase in the cost of site support as a percentage of site support revenues was also due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to lower commissions that resulted from a decrease in commissionable revenue and the conversion of certain business development directors from incentive compensation based upon commission to incentive compensation based upon bonus 
in the second half of  performance against bonus targets improved which resulted in an increase in bonus expense  which partially offset the commission expense reduction 
additionally  labor cost increases in partially offset the commission expense reduction 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was due to maintaining other selling and marketing expenditures  including labor  despite the decrease in total net revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to higher labor costs due to new hires  an increase in charitable contributions in  and increases in professional and board fees  depreciation  equipment  insurance and telephone expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets in the first half of that were not achieved as well as lower audit fees due to the high cost of the initial attestation work in on internal controls in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was also due to the decrease in net revenues and the fact that general and administrative expenses do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as foreign exchange gains  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations  foreign exchange losses and an impairment charge related to a cost basis investment 
other income  net increased primarily due to a shift to higher yielding money market investments and a decrease in interest expense related to capital leases in these increases were partially offset by foreign exchange losses in as well as an impairment charge in the first quarter of related to a cost basis investment 
our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax rate for the year ended december  included a net income tax benefit of approximately  related to the recovery of prior year state taxes due to a change in our transfer pricing methodology

additionally  there was an increase of approximately million in revenues for year ended december  versus the year ended december  for software licensed on a monthly and annual basis with new clients 
the increase in cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume with both new and existing clients  including an increase in transactions performed  and a small increase in average revenue per transaction 
additionally  project assurance fees increased due to the fact that this fee was initiated during and that there was a greater percentage of active contracts that included this fee in the increase in sales volume in was partially attributed to an increase in comprehensive thorough qtc studies 
technology consulting and training revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in consulting on clinical data management software products as there were several large consulting engagements in with nothing of a comparable size in the decrease in consulting on clinical data management software products was partially offset by an increase in configuration fees related to reporting capabilities for cardiac safety clients 
the increase in software maintenance service revenues was primarily due to new perpetual license sales during the year ended december  site support revenue increased primarily due to revenue from the rental of cardiac safety equipment  which our clients use to perform cardiac safety procedures 
additionally  equipment sales totaled million in there were no significant equipment sales in the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to an increase in labor  depreciation and increased facilities and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in cardiac safety service revenues 
additionally  amortization expense related to internal use software costs was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  see liquidity and capital resources for additional information related to internal use software 
the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues was primarily due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in third party consulting costs partially offset by an increase in labor costs in the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the reduction in consulting costs resulted from the decrease in revenue as well as staffing additions which allowed for most of the work  especially in the latter part of  to be completed by employees 

back to contents the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was due primarily to an increase in rental and depreciation costs and supplies associated with cardiac safety rental equipment  cost of equipment sold in as there were no significant sales in  and increased shipping costs and other costs associated with expanding capabilities to meet the growth in site support activities  including the addition of new dedicated site support facilities 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases in commissions that resulted from the increase in commissionable revenue  higher labor costs due to new hires  increased travel and entertainment and third party consulting costs 
these increased costs were partially offset by a reduction in bonuses due to higher targets in that were not fully achieved and savings resulting from not holding the annual users conference in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that selling and marketing expenses are discretionary in nature and can be increased or decreased as deemed necessary by management and do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to consultants assisting with internal control work required by the sarbanes oxley act as well as increased audit and internal control attestation fees of our independent registered public accountants  higher labor costs due to new hires  increased legal fees  non income based taxes  depreciation  telecommunications  provision for uncollectible accounts  insurance costs and fees related to stock buybacks 
these increases were partially offset by a planned reduction in public relations expenses and a reduction in incentive bonuses due to higher targets in that were not fully achieved 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that general and administrative expenses do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
the decrease in research and development expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to a reduction in labor costs resulting from a decrease in allocated administrative costs and the capitalization of expenditures related to internal use software development 
additionally  research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased due to the increase in net revenues and the fact that many of the research and development expenses do not necessarily increase or decrease with changes in revenues 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments as well as foreign exchange gains  net of interest expense related to capital lease obligations 
the primary reason for the increase in was higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in  foreign exchange gains and a decrease in interest expense related to capital leases in our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the tax rate increased primarily due to increased income before taxes with relatively static offsets such as tax credits for research and development 
as income increased  the impact of these tax offsets has decreased as a percentage of income before income taxes  and as a result  the effective tax rate has increased 
additionally  as a percentage of total company operating income  the operating income generated in the united states has increased which results in higher taxes as the blended federal  state and local tax rate is higher than the uk tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million invested in short term and long term investments 
we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of lower net income and less income tax benefits related to stock options exercised during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash flow was also attributable to a decrease in deferred revenues in the year ended december  compared to an increase in the year ended 
back to contents december  in the period  franchise revenue exceeded franchise payments while in the period  franchise payments exceeded franchise revenue 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of net activity related to short term investments and long term investments  which used million of cash for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increased use of cash was partially offset by a million decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment 
during the year ended december   we capitalized million of property and equipment compared to million capitalized during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of software purchased in used in the development of the upgrade to expert as discussed below 
included in property and equipment is internal use software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product expert used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety ecg services 
we capitalize certain internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position the amortization is charged to the cost of cardiac safety services beginning at the time the software is ready for its intended use 
the initial development costs of expert were for the basic functionality required for this product 
additional development costs of expert were incurred to develop new functionalities and enhancements 
we started a new internal use software project to allow for semi automated processing of ecgs in the second quarter of and further enhancements were begun in october we also began capitalizing costs associated with an upgrade to expert expert beginning in the fourth quarter of in april  we began developing enhancements to expert which are necessary while expert continues to be developed 
in mid august of  we revised our estimated timing for the completion of expert to continue the development work through the fourth quarter of  as opposed to the first quarter of as we previously had estimated 
as this upgrade will replace many parts of the existing expert product  we previously had accelerated the amortization of capitalized labor and consulting costs to fully amortize the associated costs of the existing expert product by the end of the first quarter of  which increased monthly amortization expense by  beginning in the fourth quarter of beginning in mid august of  we revised the remaining amortization period for previously capitalized labor and consulting costs to fully amortize the associated costs of the existing expert product by the end of the fourth quarter of  which decreased monthly amortization expense by  beginning in mid august at the beginning of april  we extended the remaining life of the existing expert product to co exist with expert and extended the depreciation period through august which coincides with our standard useful life for internal use software of four years 
this resulted in a decrease in monthly amortization expense of  beginning in april at this time  we expect expert to go into production in september 
back to contents the following table presents the internal use software costs and related amortization as of december  in thousands amortization period labor and consulting related direct costs of materials total capitalized costs monthly amortization accumulated amortization expert initial costs august july     additional costs april july   additional enhancements october september semi automated ecg processing software initial costs february january enhancements october september additional enhancements april march upgrade to expert september august estimated    total for the year ended december   our financing activities used cash of million compared to million for the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of a lower repurchase of common stock under our stock buy back program in the period as compared to the period as well as lower net proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the period as compared to the period 
we have a line of credit arrangement with wachovia bank  national association totaling million 
for the year ended december   we had no borrowings under the line 
we have a commitment to purchase approximately million of private label cardiac safety equipment from a manufacturer over the twelve month period ending in july this cardiac safety equipment is expected to be purchased in the normal course of business and thus does not represent a significant commitment above our expected purchases of ecg equipment during that period 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
in the second quarter of  the stock buy back program that was originally announced in april and extended to million shares in october was extended by an additional million shares to a total of million shares 
the purchase of a majority of the shares authorized could require us to use a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and could also require us to seek additional external financing 
the stock buy back authorization allows us  but does not require us  to purchase the authorized shares 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million

back to contents inflation we believe the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
recent pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
which provided additional guidance in implementing sfas no 
r without modifying the conclusions or requirements of sfas no 
r 
in april  the sec also deferred the effective date of sfas no 
r for many registrants  including our company 
the deferral now requires the adoption to be effective for our company no later than the first annual period beginning after june  we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
accordingly  we do not recognize any compensation expense related to stock option grants that we issue under our stock option plans 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  under the modified prospective method of application 
under that method  we will recognize compensation costs for new grants of share based awards  awards modified after the effective date  and the remaining portion of the fair value of the unvested awards at the adoption date 
as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we accelerated the vesting of certain unvested options to minimize the recognition of compensation costs in  and for previously granted unvested awards 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in the recognition of after tax compensation costs for share based awards equivalent to to per share in based upon unvested options at december  and planned option grants 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which eliminates an exception in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
became effective for us for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
requires retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion  accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
will be effective for us for all accounting changes and any error corrections occurring after january  critical accounting policies in december and december  the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 

back to contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues primarily from three sources license fees  services and site support 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenues consist of cardiac safety equipment rental and sales  supplies and freight 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
accordingly  we recognize up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement exists  delivery of the software and related documentation has occurred  collectability is probable and the license fee is fixed or determinable 
we recognize monthly and annual license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees are recognized evenly over the term of service 
cardiac safety services revenues consist of services that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as services are performed 
we recognize revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
we provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
the rental of cardiac safety equipment is recognized over the rental period 
sales of equipment and supplies are recognized at the time of sale 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the credit worthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of the delivered element is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to the uncertain realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

back to contents depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over four years  or a shorter period if an upgrade replacement is expected to take place prior to the end of the four year period 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  for a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  we will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure
