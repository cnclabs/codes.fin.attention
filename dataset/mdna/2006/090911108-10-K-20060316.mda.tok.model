item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report and other information incorporated by reference in this report  if any 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a medical technology company that develops  manufactures and markets lasers and related products focused on technologies for improved applications and procedures in dentistry and medicine 
in particular  our principal products provide dental laser systems that allow dentists  periodontists  endodontists  oral surgeons and 
table of contents other specialists to perform a broad range of dental procedures  including cosmetic and complex surgical applications 
our systems are designed to provide clinically superior performance for many types of dental procedures  with less pain and faster recovery times than are generally achieved with drills  scalpels and other dental instruments 
we have clearance from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to market our laser systems in the united states and also have the necessary approvals to sell our laser systems in canada  the european union and certain other international markets 
we are currently pursuing regulatory approval to market and sell our waterlase system in japan 
since  we have sold approximately  waterlase systems including  waterlase md systems and more than  laser systems in over countries 
we offer two categories of laser system products i waterlase system and ii diode system 
our flagship product category  the waterlase system  uses a patented combination of water and laser to perform most procedures currently performed using dental drills  scalpels and other traditional dental instruments for cutting soft and hard tissue 
we also offer a family of diode laser system products to perform soft tissue and cosmetic procedures  including tooth whitening 
waterlase system 
we refer to our patented interaction of water with laser as ysgg laser hydrophotonics 
ysgg is a shortened abbreviation referring to the unique crystal er  cr ysgg laser used in the waterlase  which contains the elements erbium  chromium  yttrium  scandium  gallium and garnet 
this unique crystal laser produces energy with specific absorption and tissue interaction characteristics optimized for dental applications 
hydrophotonics refers to the interaction of laser with water to produce energy to cut tissue 
through ysgg laser hydrophotonics  the waterlase system can precisely cut hard tissue  such as bone and teeth  and soft tissue  such as gums  with minimal or no damage to surrounding tissue 
the waterlase system is the best selling dental laser system  and we estimate it currently accounts for a majority of all dental lasers sold worldwide 
diode system 
we also offer a family of diode system products  which use a semiconductor diode laser to perform soft tissue and cosmetic procedures  including tooth whitening 
our diode system serves the growing markets for cosmetic and hygiene procedures 
the diode system  together with our waterlase system  offers practitioners a broad product line with a range of features and price points 
we also manufacture and sell accessories and consumables for our laser systems  such as hand pieces  laser tips and tooth whitening gel 
the waterlase system comprised  and of our total net revenue for the years ended december   and respectively 
the diode system comprised  and of our total net revenue for the same periods 
we currently market our products directly to dental practitioners through regional  national and international trade publications events  meetings and seminars 
we sell our products in the united states  canada  germany  spain and italy through our direct sales force  which is organized by region 
outside of these countries we sell our products through a network of independent distributors located in europe  asia and australia 
many dentists finance their purchases through third party leasing companies or banks 
in these transactions  the dentist first enters into a purchase order with us 
we then enter into a purchase order with the leasing company  which purchases the product from us  and the dentist enters into a lease agreement with the leasing company 
we receive payment in full for the product by the leasing company  and we are not a party to the lease with the dentist 
the dentist pays the leasing company or bank in installments  and we do not bear the credit risk that the dentist might not make payments 
the leasing companies and banks do not have recourse to us for a dentist s failure to make payments  nor do we have any obligation to take back the product at the end of the lease 
approximately of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in  was generated from dentists who financed their purchase through national technology leasing corporation  an equipment leasing broker 
we are regularly approached by leasing companies seeking to finance purchases of our products and do not believe the loss of national technology leasing or any other current financing source would materially harm our business 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are i the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and ii that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
we sell products domestically to customers through our direct sales force  and internationally through a direct sales force and through distributors 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to our customer  or services have been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
through august  the terms of our purchase orders for products sold domestically required payment in full before title was transferred 
accordingly  with all other criteria being met  we recognized revenue when payment was received 
for products sold internationally through our direct sales force we recognized revenue when all other criteria were met and we completed installation  which was when the customer became obligated to pay 
in august  we modified the sales arrangements with our customers so that title transfers to the customer upon shipment for domestic sales  and there is an enforceable obligation to pay upon shipment for international direct sales 
in august  we began recording revenue for domestic sales and international direct sales upon shipment 
we recognize revenue for products sold to our distributors internationally when the product is shipped 
we adopted eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july   which requires us to evaluate whether the separate deliverables in our arrangements can be unbundled 
we determined that the sales of our waterlase systems include separate deliverables consisting of the product  disposables used with the waterlase system  installation and training 
for these sales  we apply the residual value method  which requires us to allocate to the delivered elements the total arrangement consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we determined that the sales of our diode system include separate deliverables consisting of the product  disposables and training 
for these sales  we apply the relative fair value method  which requires us to allocate the total arrangement consideration to the relative fair value of each element 
deferred revenue attributable to the undelivered elements  primarily training and installation  are included in deferred revenue when the product is shipped and are recognized when the related service is performed 
the key judgment related to our revenue recognition relates to the collectibility of payment from the customer 
we evaluate the customer s credit worthiness prior to the shipment of the product 
based on our assessment of the credit information available to us  we may determine the credit risk is higher than normally acceptable  and we will either decline the purchase or defer the revenue until payment is reasonably assured 
although all sales are final  we accept returns of products in certain  limited circumstances and record a provision for sales returns based on historical experience concurrent with the recognition of revenue 
the sales returns allowance is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable  revenue and cost of revenue 

table of contents we recognize revenue for royalties under licensing agreements for our patented technology when the product using our technology is sold 
we estimate and recognize the amount earned based on historical performance and current knowledge about the business operations of our licensees 
our estimates have been consistent with amounts historically reported by the licensees 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable to estimate the risk of extending credit to customers 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our knowledge of customers and their compliance with credit terms 
the evaluation process includes a review of customers accounts on a regular basis which incorporates input from sales  service and finance personnel 
the review process evaluates all account balances with amounts outstanding days and other specific amounts for which information obtained indicates that the balance may be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted based on such evaluation  with a corresponding provision included in general and administrative expenses 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
valuation of inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method or market 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventory and maintain an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate quantities on hand  physical condition and technical functionality  as these characteristics may be impacted by anticipated customer demand for current products and new product introductions 
unfavorable changes in estimates of excess and obsolete inventory would result in an increase in cost of revenue and a decrease in gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  and certain intangibles with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise productively support our business goals 
we monitor events and changes in circumstances  which could indicate that the carrying balances of long lived assets may exceed the undiscounted expected future cash flows from those assets 
if such a condition were to exist  we would recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our strategy to focus our sales efforts on high end laser products such as the new waterlase md product  which was first sold during the fourth quarter of as a result  the actual sales of diolase plus were below our original expectations and we expect this trend to continue 
we estimated the fair value of the diolase plus trade name based on a relief from royalty approach using discounted cash flows from revised projected diolase plus revenue 
the  excess of the carrying value over the asset s estimated fair value was recorded as a charge to operations in the fourth quarter of we conducted our annual impairment analysis of our goodwill and trade names as of june  and concluded there had been no further impairment in trade names and no impairment in goodwill 
warranty cost 
products sold directly to end users are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
products sold internationally to distributors are covered by a warranty on parts for up to fourteen months 
estimated warranty expenses are recorded as an accrued liability  with a corresponding provision to cost of revenue 
this estimate is recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue 
the accrual is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
an increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in the accrual and a decrease in gross profit 
litigation and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from 
table of contents litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of expense relating to contingencies 
to be recorded as expense  a loss contingency must be both probable and reasonably estimable 
if a loss contingency is material but is not both probable and estimable  we will disclose the matter in the notes to the financial statements 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million charge to operations for a patent infringement legal settlement related to the lawsuit between us and diodem 
income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or tax planning strategies 
if we conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a probability level of more than  a valuation allowance is not recorded 
during the years ended december  and  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  would not be realized 
in this determination  we considered factors such as our earnings history  future projections and tax planning strategies 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions becomes apparent  we may reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations and in additional paid in capital 
management evaluates the potential realization of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for releasing the valuation allowance periodically 
the utilization of nol and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
section of the internal revenue code of generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nol carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income where a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership 
in october  we completed an analysis to determine the potential applicability of any annual limitations imposed by section based on our analysis  we believe that  as of december   we have  for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of nol carryforwards 
of this amount  approximately million is available to offset federal taxable income and the taxable income generated in future years 
additional nol carryforwards will become available at the rate of approximately million per year for the years through however  any future ownership changes qualifying under section may limit our ability to use remaining nol carryforwards 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet financing  or contractual arrangements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our consolidated income statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as percentages of revenue years ended december  consolidated statements of operations data net revenue cost of revenue gross profit other income  net operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering and development patent infringement legal settlement impairment of intangible asset total operating expenses loss income from operations non operating loss income  net loss income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net loss income net revenue 
net revenue consists of sales of our laser systems  related disposables and accessories  service revenue  training revenue and royalty revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue is comprised of all costs to manufacture our products  including materials  labor and related overhead costs such as depreciation  warranty and service costs 
other income  net 
other income consists of gain loss on sale of assets  primarily related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california in march this sale resulted in a gain of  and is being recognized over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in other income in and included the amortization of deferred gain offset by a gain loss on the sale of certain fixed assets 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits  commissions  and other costs related to our direct sales force  advertising costs and expenses related to trade shows and seminars 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and benefits of administrative personnel as well as insurance  professional and regulatory fees  provisions for doubtful accounts  penalties and interest on amounts collected from customers but not timely remitted to the states  and subsequent gain for the amount of the liability relieved by the state 
engineering and development expense 
engineering and development expenses consist of engineering personnel salaries and benefits  prototype supplies  contract services and consulting fees related to product development 

table of contents non operating loss income 
non operating loss income consists of interest income and expense  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and items not directly related to our operations 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash balances and short term investments  and interest expense relates to interest costs on our line of credit 
we generate a substantial portion of our net revenue from the sale of products outside the united states 
our sales in europe are denominated principally in euros  and our sales in other international markets are denominated in dollars 
as we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset foreign currency fluctuations  we are at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the value of the euro 
an increase in the relative value of the dollar would lead to less income from sales denominated in euros unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
conversely  a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would lead to more income from sales denominated in euros 
additionally  we are obligated to pay expenses relating to our german facility in euros 
thus  we are also at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the euro with respect to our obligation to pay expenses relating to our operations in germany 
an increase in the value of the dollar relative to the euro would reduce the expenses associated with the operations of our german facility  whereas a decrease in the relative value of the dollar would increase the cost associated with the operations of our german facility 
income taxes 
we estimate our actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or tax planning strategies 
if we conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized a probability level of more than  a valuation allowance is not recorded 
based upon our operating losses during and and the available evidence  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets as of december  and  which consist primarily of nol carryforwards  will not be realized 
consequently  we had established a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset of approximately and million as of december  and  respectively 
in this determination  we considered factors such as our earnings history  future projected earnings and tax planning strategies 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income becomes apparent in the future  we may reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
management evaluates the potential realization of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for reducing the valuation allowance periodically 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with net revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenue primarily resulted from higher sales of extended warranty packages  advanced training programs  and peripherals  such as handpieces and laser tips 
at the same time  we had a decrease in sales of our waterlase systems  which made up approximately of our total revenues in this decrease was almost completely offset by an increase in the average selling prices of our systems 
we believe that four primary factors in contributed to the decrease in unit volume of laser systems sold we experienced significant vendor part and component failures with our waterlase md system  which had been launched at the end of this not only affected our ability to deliver consistently functioning units  but also affected customer satisfaction 
we believe this dissatisfaction resulted in a reduction of referrals from existing customers  and thus negatively affected revenues during we believe our target customer base progressed from the innovator category of dentists  which generally purchase technology quickly and desire to be on the cutting edge ahead of other customers  to the early adopter category of dentists  which generally require more scientific evidence and 
table of contents economic rationale prior to purchase 
this progression into the early adopter category is typically associated with a longer selling cycle 
because of this progression  we devoted a substantial portion of modifying our marketing programs and messages and training our domestic sales force to be more effective in selling using these new programs 
as a result of these changes  revenues were negatively affected in our image was negatively affected during as we experienced a restatement of our financial statements and the resultant late filings of financial statements with the securities and exchange commission  as well as the notification from nasdaq of the potential for de listing our common stock 
while these matters were satisfactorily resolved by the time we filed our form q with the securities and exchange commission for the quarter ended september   we believe customers may have postponed or altogether canceled their plans to purchase a laser system from us 
unit sales in the quarter ended december  demonstrated a significant improvement  and we believe that our image has improved with the resolution of last year s financial filing issues 
due to a combination of the above mentioned factors  we experienced a higher than normal rate of sales force attrition in  principally during the first half of the year 
as a result  we hired a significant number of new sales representatives  who required substantial sales and product training before becoming productive 
this sales force attrition dropped significantly during the second half of and we believe that the situation has stabilized  as the new sales representatives achieved significant sales growth during the quarter ended december  we believe that the size of the potential market  our position within that market and the quality and reliability of our product offerings are fundamentally unchanged 
although we do not expect our revenue growth to reach previous historical rates that were in excess of  we do expect modest revenue growth going forward 
sales of our waterlase systems comprised and of our net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of our diolase system comprised and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect the waterlase system will continue to account for the majority of our net revenue 
international revenue for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenue  as compared with million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  sales to canada  asia  latin america and pacific rim countries were approximately million and sales to europe  middle east and africa emea were approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenue  a decrease of million  as compared with gross profit of million  or of net revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was caused primarily by an increase in manufacturing costs for the new waterlase md system  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  including associated higher warranty and material scrap expenses  as well to an increase in fixed manufacturing infrastructure  including quality control  materials management  and other support activities 
we generated a lower gross margin on the initial production quantities of the waterlase md system due to these factors  but experienced an improved margin on the waterlase md system during the fourth quarter ended december  this improvement in the fourth quarter resulted largely from a reduction in the number of vendor part and component issues which in turn has recently improved our product reliability and customer satisfaction 
for  we expect the waterlase md system to comprise a greater percentage of our net revenue 
on january  we increased the list selling price of our waterlase md system 
we also expect improved manufacturing efficiency and product quality  as we eliminated many of the vendor part and component issues  and  reduced warranty  scrap and product rework expenses 
we believe these factors will contribute to increased gross margin in 
table of contents other income  net 
other income consists of gain loss on sale of assets 
other income  net was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  for each of the years ended december  and  other income included  related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california in march  partially offset by lesser gain or loss amounts on other sales of assets 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenue  a million increase as compared with million  or of net revenue for the year ended december  the increase was driven mainly by high levels of legal and compliance costs described below under general and administrative expense and the cost of the surgilight license described below under engineering and development expense  offset by the absence of patent infringement legal settlement costs in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or approximately  to million  or of net revenue  as compared with million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was related to costs for additional sales and marketing personnel  including an increased sales force  and professional fees for various sales and marketing programs 
facilities costs  depreciation and insurance costs contributed approximately million to the overall increase in sales and marketing expenses 
we expect to experience a decrease in overall sales and marketing expenses in as we focus on planned cost containment measures  primarily including reduced participation in conventions and seminars  decreased spending on advertising and promotion  and  improved recoupment of training and education costs from participating customers 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  or of net revenue  as compared with million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  the majority of the increase resulted from costs associated with the restatements of our and financial statements and delayed and financial statement filings as well as costs incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  or sox the most significant of the increases were as follows an increase in personnel related costs related to increased infrastructure in finance  information technology  human resources and administration of approximately million  an increase in temporary labor expenses of approximately million  an increase in audit and audit related fees of approximately million  and an increase in other professional fees of approximately million 
legal expenses decreased in as compared to by approximately million primarily because of decreased litigation activity 
we expect to experience a decrease in overall general and administrative expenses in as we become more efficient in the execution of our sox activities and due to the expected absence of the one time costs that were incurred in related to the financial restatements 
on december   the board of directors and the compensation committee approved accelerating the exercisability of  unvested stock options outstanding under our stock incentive plan  effective as of december  the options are held by employees  including executive officers  and have a range of exercise prices of to per share 
the closing price per share of our common stock on december   the last trading day before effectiveness of the acceleration  was 
in order to prevent unintended personal benefits  shares of our common stock received upon exercise of an accelerated option remain subject to the original vesting period with respect to transferability of such shares and  consequently  may not be sold or otherwise transferred prior to the expiration of such original vesting period 
the purpose of accelerating vesting was to minimize our recognition of compensation expense associated with these options upon adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal the maximum aggregate pre tax expense associated with the accelerated options that would have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements in future fiscal years is estimated to be approximately million 
the accelerated 
table of contents exercisability of options created an additional compensation expense to provide for an estimate of the benefit that would be received by future terminating employees who exercise options prior to the term of their respective original vesting periods 
the compensation expense was based on estimate of the future turnover percentage of times the intrinsic value of the accelerated stock options on december  and amounted to additional compensation expense of approximately  all of which was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal however  to the extent that any accelerated options are exercised prior to the term of their respective original vesting periods and the estimated compensation expense proves insufficient  we may incur additional compensation expense in the future related to these accelerated options 
engineering and development expense 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or to million  or of net revenue  as compared with million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  the increase was largely due to the million purchase of the surgilight license  including transaction costs of million  to use certain patents in the field of presbyopia  together with higher employee costs and patent fees associated with product development in the ophthalmology and presbyopia space 
patent infringement legal settlement 
for the year ended december   we recorded an expense for a patent infringement legal settlement of million  or of net revenue  associated with the settlement of the diodem litigation 
in january  we acquired the intellectual property portfolio of diodem  consisting of certain us and international patents of which four were asserted against us  and settled the existing litigation between us and diodem  for consideration of million in cash   shares of our common stock  and a five year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in addition  if certain criteria specified in the purchase agreement are satisfied on or before july   additional shares of our common stock that we have placed in escrow may be released to diodem and we will incur an expense equal to the fair market value of those shares at the time of their release 
these escrowed shares had a fair market value of  at the time of the binding letter of intent 
the total consideration for the transaction was estimated to have a value of million  excluding the value of the shares held in escrow 
we did not pay and have no obligation to pay any royalties to diodem on past or future sales of our products  but we agreed to pay additional consideration if any of the acquired patents or certain other patents held by us is licensed to a third party 
impairment of intangible asset 
during  we determined that our intangible assets associated with certain trade names were impaired based on circumstances that arose in the fourth quarter surrounding future expected sales of our diolase product 
the underlying factors contributing to our revised estimate included a reduced projected rate of sales growth for this product as a result of increased competition for relatively low priced laser devices  resulting in management s decision to focus our sales efforts on high end laser products such as the new waterlase md product launched in the fourth quarter of an expense of  was recorded in related to this impairment 
no additional impairment was recorded for non operating loss income loss gain on foreign currency transactions 
we realized a million loss on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december   compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  due to the changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to offset foreign currency fluctuations 
therefore  we are at risk for changes in the value of the dollar relative to the value of the euro  which is the only non us dollar denominated currency in which we have transacted material business 
loss gain on sale of marketable securities 
our investments consist of us government securities and have been classified as available for sale 
we realized a  loss on sale of marketable securities for the year ended december   compared to a  gain for the year ended december  
table of contents interest income 
interest income results from interest earned on our cash and investments balances 
interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared with million for the year ended december  while the average investments balance declined considerably in due to the amount of cash used in operating activities  the investments earned much higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest on the outstanding balance on our line of credit  standby fees relating to our increased borrowing capacity under the line of credit  and the periodic use of the line during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  income taxes 
an income tax provision of million was recognized for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december  a significant component of the income tax provision in was the recording of a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
based upon our operating losses and the weight of the available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that we will not realize all of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will begin expiring in as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately  and  respectively  which will begin expiring in for federal purposes and carryforward indefinitely for state purposes 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with net revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million consists of increases in the number of products and services sold as a result of a greater marketing and sales focus 
however  the rate of increase in revenue growth year over year represents a decrease from the recent historical trend which we believe is the result of a shift in the makeup of our end customer  whereby we began to transition from selling to innovators to early adopters 
the results for were favorably impacted due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
in august  we modified our sales arrangements with our customers and began recognizing revenue upon shipment for our domestic sales  or on an accrual basis  which had previously been recognized upon receipt of payment in full  or on a cash basis 
additionally  we began to recognize revenue upon shipment for our international direct sales  which had previously been recognized after completion of installation 
as a result  during we recorded million in net revenue under the revenue recognition policy in effect before the modification to our sales arrangements and million in net revenue under our revenue recognition policy in effect after the modification to our sales arrangements 
net revenues unaffected by the changes in our revenue recognition policy were million for the year ended december  sales of our waterlase system comprised and of our total net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our diolase system comprised and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
international revenue for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenue  as compared with million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  sales to canada asia  latin america and pacific rim countries were approximately million while sales to europe  middle east and africa emea were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of revenue  an increase of million  as compared with gross profit of million  or of net revenue for the year ended 
table of contents december  gross profit for the year ended december  included million of gross profit for domestic sales recognized on a cash basis and million recognized on an accrual basis 
gross profit for the year ended december  included million recognized for international direct sales upon completion of installation and million recognized upon shipment 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was due to an increase in manufacturing costs related to the launch of our new waterlase md system in the fourth quarter of as well to an increase in fixed manufacturing infrastructure  including quality control  materials management and other support activities 
we generated a lower gross margin on the initial production quantities of the waterlase md due to these factors 
we also experienced an increase in excess and obsolete inventory of  associated with slow moving raw materials  which decreased our gross margin approximately 
additionally  included in cost of revenue is million and of expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  for training and wcli seminars related to our multiple element arrangements  which decreased our gross margin by approximately 
other income  net 
other income  net was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  other income in included the amortization of deferred gain of  offset by a loss of  on the sale of certain fixed assets 
other income in included the amortization of deferred gain of  plus a gain of  on the sale of certain fixed assets

impairment of intangible asset 
during  we determined that our intangible assets associated with certain trade names were impaired based on circumstances that arose in the fourth quarter surrounding future expected sales of our diolase product 
the underlying factors contributing to our revised estimate included a reduced projected rate of sales growth for this product as a result of increased competition for relatively low priced laser devices resulting in management s decision to focus our sales efforts on high end laser products such as the new waterlase md product launched in the fourth quarter of an expense of  was recorded in related to this impairment 
non operating income loss gain on foreign currency transactions 
we realized an  gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december   compared to  gain for the year ended december  due to the changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and euro 
due to the relatively low volume of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we have not engaged in hedging transactions to offset foreign currency fluctuations

an income tax provision of million was recognized for the year ended december  a significant component of this income tax provision was the recording of the million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million and a credit of million to additional paid in capital 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was due to the reduction of the valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the credit to additional paid in capital was the result of a stock option deduction available to us in and prior year deductions included in the deferred tax assets which were previously offset by the valuation allowance 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our operating losses and the weight of the available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that we will not realize all of these deductible differences

we have at various times experienced fluctuations in quarterly net revenue due to seasonality 
many medical device companies such as ours experience weakness in the calendar third quarter as medical providers  practitioners and patients often postpone elective procedures during the summer months 
this weakness is frequently offset by greater revenues in the calendar fourth quarter 
we expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in revenue resulting from a change in our historical seasonality pattern  or otherwise  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenue in europe is denominated principally in euros  and our revenue in other international markets is denominated in dollars 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar to the euro would lead to less income from revenue denominated in euros  unless we increase prices  which may not be possible due to competitive conditions in europe 
additionally  since expenses relating to our manufacturing operations in germany are paid in euros  an increase in the value of the euro relative to the dollar would increase the expenses associated with our german manufacturing operations and reduce our earnings 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
however  as our international operations grow  we may enter into such arrangements in the future 
foreign currency denominated sales have not been significant 
we currently have a line of credit in the amount of million at the variable interest rate equivalent to the prime rate for advances less than  and with less than two business days notice  and at libor plus for advances of  or more and with two business days notice 
this line of credit currently expires on september  at december   we had an outstanding balance of million 
based on this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rates would result in a change in interest expense of  our primary objective in managing our cash balances has been preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity to meet our operating needs 
most of our excess cash balances are invested in a money market account and us treasury securities in which there is minimal interest rate risk
