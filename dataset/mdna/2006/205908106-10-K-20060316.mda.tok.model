additional information and where to find it the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth in this part ii has been changed to reflect the realigned operating segments commercial  federal government and vendor management services chimes for  as previously reported in the company s form k for the year ended december  revenue generating activities the majority of the company s revenues are derived from professional services rendered in the information technology sector 
effective january   the company realigned its business operations into three segments commercial  federal government rgii and vendor management services chimes 
the commercial business consists of providing technology consultants to large organizations on a temporary hire basis and is classified in two general categories  staff augmentation and solutions work 
for the year ended december   this segment represented approximately of total revenues  including million of staff augmentation revenue and million of commercial solutions revenue 
for staff augmentation assignments  the consultant work is supervised and managed by the customer 
staff augmentation tends to be a lower risk  lower gross margin business with very competitive pricing 
the company s solutions work tends to be higher margin  higher risk business  due to the fact that the company is responsible for project deliverables and other conditions contained in statements of work and or contracts with clients 
virtually all projects performed by the commercial solutions group are it related and consist of practices such as application development  outsourcing arrangements  government services  health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa services  technology training and managed services 
the company s customer relationships are memorialized in master agreements which address the terms and conditions which define the client engagement 
depending on the service to be performed for the client  either a task order in the case of a staffing engagement or a statement of work sow in the case of a solutions engagement is generated 
the sow is signed by both the company and the customer 
in general  no solutions work is done unless there is a sow because the sow provides the technical details of the work to be done 
the sow  although falling under the corresponding master agreement  is a stand alone binding contractual document  typically outlining the project objectives  describing the personnel who will work on the project  describing phases of the project  the timeframes for work performance  and the rate of compensation  on a time and materials basis 
in the event that the parameters of the project expand or otherwise change  a project change request is implemented to memorialize whatever change has occurred to the deliverables  personnel and or time materials 
the master agreements  in conjunction with the sows  are written to define  with as much detail as possible  the client relationship and all aspects of the work to be performed for the client 
with regard to revenues expected in future periods  each sow has a defined term or sets forth the anticipated length of a project 
where a client engagement is on going  like certain help desk type services  the master agreements would still have a term length  but would recite that the agreement was renewable 
generally  commercial solutions engagements are for a year or less 
staff augmentation engagements can and do last for more than a year  with variations in the number of consultants being provided at any given time 
staffing engagements are generally cancelable by clients with a two to four week notice period 
commercial accounted for approximately of revenue 
the federal government segment consists primarily of solutions type assignments  whereby the company is responsible for project deliverables and other conditions contained in sows and or contracts with the federal government 
federal government engagements generally have a duration of several years  contingent upon the federal government exercising annual options to continue work 
for the year ended december   the federal government segment accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
chimes  inc  or chimes  is a human capital management solution that  through the use of proprietary software and processes  manages the acquisition of temporary workforce of large organizations 
for the year ended december   chimes accounted for approximately of total revenues 
critical accounting policies the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements are related to revenue recognition  the evaluation of the bad debt reserve  the valuation of goodwill  and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition approximately and of consolidated revenue in and  respectively  was derived from time and material contracts 
the company recognizes revenues either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee basis 
under a typical time and materials billing arrangement  our customers are billed on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  revenue is estimated and accrued for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are billed the following month 
for fixed fee contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion 
each fixed fee contract has different terms  milestones and deliverables 
the milestones and deliverables primarily relate to the work to be performed and the timing of the billing 
at the end of each reporting period an assessment of revenue recognized on the percentage of completion and milestones achieved criteria is made 
if it becomes apparent that estimated cost will be exceeded  an adjustment to revenue and or costs will be made 
the cumulative effect of revisions in estimated revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the impact of any revisions become known 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of customer billings principally on a time and materials basis 
at the end of each accounting period  revenue is accrued for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are billed the following month 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on fixed fee contracts arise when percentage of completion accounting is used 
such amounts are billed at specific dates or at contract completion 
the company s chimes subsidiary recognizes revenue on a transaction fee basis 
the chimes service offering aggregates the suppliers of temporary workers to the customer and renders one invoice to the customer 
upon payment from the customer  chimes deducts a transaction fee and remits the balance of the client payment to the applicable vendor 
chimes recognizes only their fee for the service  not the aggregate billing to the customer 
the gross amount of the customer invoicing is not considered revenue or a receivable to chimes because there is no earnings process for the gross amount and by contract terms  chimes is not obligated to pay the vendor until paid by the customer 
evaluation of bad debt reserve the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to income or to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill as of december  and  the fair value of each of the reporting units was calculated using the following approaches i market approach and ii income approach 
the reporting units are equal to  or one level below  reportable segments 
under the market approach  value is estimated by comparing the performance fundamentals relating to similar public companies stock prices 
multiples are then developed of the value of the publicly traded stock to various measures and are then applied to each reporting unit to estimate the value of its equity 
under the income approach  value is determined using the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
the fair value conclusion of the reporting units reflects an appropriately weighted value of the market multiple approach and the income approach discussed above 
an asset approach is not used because the asset approach is most relevant for liquidation approaches  investment company valuations and asset rich company valuations ie real estate entities and was not deemed relevant for manufacturing and service company going concern valuations 
for the year ended december   using an evaluation prepared by an independent appraisal firm  the company completed an assessment of the fair value and carrying value of its federal government segment 
as of december   the indicated fair value of the federal government reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
as a result  the company concluded that the goodwill of approximately million is not impaired 
for the year ended december   the company reassessed the carrying value of goodwill associated with its commercial solutions group 
because of a reduction in projected future cash flows in the commercial solutions business unit  primarily resulting from significant revenue declines in  the company determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million  related to the write off of the commercial solutions goodwill 
there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as the related goodwill was primarily attributable to acquisitions which yielded no tax basis for the company 
the remaining goodwill of million  as of december   is associated with the company s federal government segment 
valuation of the deferred tax asset the company records deferred tax assets for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and their respective tax bases  and operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers the scheduled reversal periods of the deferred tax assets  whether sustained profitability has been achieved and tax planning strategies 
the company has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards  and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods 
the company has provided full valuation allowances on the future tax benefits related to capital losses  foreign net operating losses  and most state net operating losses 
the company believes that the valuation allowance is appropriate because these deferred tax assets have relatively short carryforward periods or relate to taxing jurisdictions which do not allow the filing of consolidated tax returns 
the company expects to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until an appropriate level of profitability has been achieved in the applicable taxing jurisdictions  or strategies are developed that would enable the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
in prior years management relied primarily on future projected income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets resulting from federal net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences 
as of december  it was determined that because of continued losses through the fourth quarter of the current year  it was no longer appropriate to rely on future projected income until sustained profitability has been achieved 
accordingly  the company recorded a full valuation allowance on its remaining net deferred tax assets of million in the fourth quarter of as indicated previously in board review of strategic alternatives  various expressions of interest have been received for the purchase of all or parts of the company 
should some of these result in the sale of parts of the company  significant amounts of the million of available net deferred tax assets may be realized 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k  for further information regarding deferred income taxes

fas r requires that compensation cost be recognized for new awards of equity instruments and unvested awards on the adoption date

sab assists issuers in their initial implementation of fas r and indicates that the staff s understanding that  particularly in the period of initial implementation  issuers may reasonably arrive at different estimates and option valuations in applying fas r 
the provisions of this statement are effective for the company s first quarter ending march  statement r requires compensation cost be recognized for new awards of equity instruments and unvested awards on the adoption date 
statement r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the first method is the modified prospective application whereby compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under statement  accounting for stock based compensation  as originally issued 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date will be accounted for under the provisions of statement r 
the second method is the modified retrospective application  which requires that the company restates prior period financial statements 
the modified retrospective application may be applied either to all prior periods or only to prior interim periods in the year of adoption of this statement 
the company is currently determining which transition method it will adopt and is evaluating the impact statement r will have on its financial position  results of operations  eps and cash flows when the statement is adopted

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets fas an amendment of accounting principles board opinion no 
opinion 
the guidance in opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the underlying principle that the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
however  opinion included certain exceptions to that principle  including a requirement that exchanges of similar productive assets should be recorded at the carrying amount of the asset relinquished 
fas eliminates that exception and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that lack commercial substance 
only nonmonetary exchanges in which an entity s future cash flows are expected to significantly change as a result of the exchange will be considered to have commercial substance 
fas must be applied to nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

 accounting changes and error corrections fas  which changes the accounting and reporting requirements for the change in an accounting principle 
accounting principles board opinion  accounting changes opinion  which is superseded by fas  required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle as a component of net income in the period of the change 
fas instead requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in an accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
fas differentiates between retrospective application and restatement 
retrospective application is defined as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
in contrast  restatement is defined as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
fas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the guidance contained in opinion for reporting the corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements  and changes in accounting estimates is carried forward to fas without change 
additionally  fas carries forward the guidance in opinion requiring justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability 
fas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations savings plan and other retirement plans the company maintains a defined contribution savings plan covering eligible employees
