overview energy conversion devices  inc invents  designs  develops and commercializes materials  products and production processes for the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets 
our materials  products and production processes originate from the pioneering work of mr 
stanford r 
ovshinsky  principal inventor and our president  chief scientist and technologist  in materials science at the atomic or nanostructure level  principally amorphous and disordered materials 
based on this work  we have invented and developed materials that permit the design and commercialization of products such as thin film solar photovoltaic or pv modules  nickel metal hydride nimh batteries and phase change memory devices 
our business strategy is to invent  design and develop materials  products and production processes and then commercialize these materials  products and production processes internally and through third party relationships  such as licenses and joint ventures 
as part of this strategy  we regularly evaluate and align our technology portfolio with respect to high potential  emerging technologies to meet market needs and then allocate resources to those technologies accordingly 
we also continue to invent new  basic technologies to add to our portfolio  while at the same time improving our existing technologies 
our current commercialized products  including thin film pv modules and nimh batteries  have been brought to commercialization through this strategy 
our commercialized solar and nimh battery products are experiencing significant increases in demand  driven principally by converging global trends  including rising prices for traditional energy resources  national security concerns based on reliance on foreign energy sources  growing government incentives for renewable energy resources and the public s demand for more fuel efficient vehicles 
we expect demand for alternative energy generation solutions  including our thin film pv modules  to continue to increase dramatically over the next several years 
in response  we plan to increase our manufacturing capacity from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by in march  we completed an offering of our common stock and raised net proceeds of approximately  which we intend to use principally for this expansion  including construction of a mw manufacturing facility in greenville  michigan 
in addition  we recently announced that we are adding a second mw per annum pv cell manufacturing facility at our greenville site  which is expected to begin operation in mid our overall alternative energy strategy includes developing a complete systems solution for the hydrogen economy  including products and systems based on our pv technology to generate electricity to extract hydrogen from water through electrolysis  products and systems based on our ovonic solid hydrogen storage technology to store  transport and distribute hydrogen  products and systems based upon our nimh technology to store electricity and power hybrid electric vehicles  and products and systems based on our ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technology and other technologies including modified internal combustion engines and turbines to use hydrogen as a fuel source for a wide range of transportation  stationary and mobile applications 
our business segments ecd operates in three business segments united solar ovonic  ovonic battery which includes our joint venture  cobasys llc and ecd which includes our joint venture  ovonyx  inc 
financial information regarding each segment is available in note l  business segments  of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
united solar ovonic segment our united solar ovonic segment consists of our thin film solar pv business in which we design  develop  manufacture and sell pv modules that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
this business  which we conduct through our wholly owned subsidiary  united solar ovonic llc  is based principally on our pioneering technologies for thin film amorphous silicon pv cells and low cost  roll to roll manufacturing 
we manufacture our pv modules using our proprietary  roll to roll process in which we deposit amorphous silicon as a thin film on a sheet of stainless steel 
our pv modules are lightweight  thin  flexible and durable and can be integrated directly with roofing materials for a seamless appearance 
conventional pv products  which currently represent over of the solar modules sold globally  are made of crystalline or polycrystalline silicon and are covered in glass enclosed by a metal frame 
our pv modules are typically foot laminates without a frame and have several competitive advantages over conventional pv products  including greater electricity generation per rated power output  no use of polysilicon material  which is currently in short supply  low cost of production  simpler  lower cost installation  greater durability  lighter weight  better aesthetics  more applications  and greater opportunity to reduce product cost and increase profitability with higher production volumes 
we are presently focusing primarily on terrestrial applications for our pv modules  such as commercial and industrial roofing solutions 
however  we have also designed and are developing pv products for space and stratospheric applications and are presently working with lockheed martin and the united states air force to develop ultra lightweight pv cells and modules for satellites and airships 
we believe that we have a strategic competitive advantage because our pv modules are readily adaptable for seamless integration into various roofing materials  and we therefore sell most of our modules to commercial roofing materials manufacturers  builders and building contractors  and solar power installers integrators  who incorporate our solar panels into their products and services for commercial sale and then handle all aspects of the consumer relationship  including marketing  sales and service 
our strategic customers include solar integrated technologies inc sit  biohaus pv handels gmbh biohaus  alwitra flachdach systeme gmbh  urs corporation  corus bausysteme gmbh  hoesch contecna systembau  unimetal spa  sunset energietechnik gmbh  and actus lend lease a subsidiary of lend lease corp 
ltd 
sales to sit represented and of our product sales in this segment in the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
in the fiscal year ended june   biohaus represented of our product sales in this segment 
we also sell framed pv products on a limited basis 
years ended june  and june   respectively 
we also sell framed pv products on a limited basis 
we compete with companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on well established technologies for electricity generation  as well as companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on alternative energy generation technologies  such as solar and wind 
our principal competitors in the solar market include sharp corporation  q cells ag  kyocera corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd 
sanyo and mitsubishi electric corporation  all of which manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar cells 
the competitiveness of alternative energy generation products in general  including solar power products  is typically enhanced by governmental incentives designed to encourage the use of these products as compared to conventional energy generation sources  which today are less expensive at the customer level in most locations 
however  our long term goal is to compete directly  without subsidies  in energy markets 
our long term research and development strategy involves improving the throughput of our pv cell manufacturing equipment  reducing the cost of production and increasing the sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of our pv modules 
for example  we have extended the throughput of our existing pv module manufacturing equipment to mw per annum and are continuing our efforts to reach an expected capacity of mw per annum 
we have an extensive patent portfolio in pv technology with us and foreign counterparts covering solar cell and module materials  manufacturing processes and product design  including basic patents that have broad coverage 
we are also regularly adding new patents to our portfolio based upon our continuing research and development activities 
as a result  we do not believe that the expiration of any of our pv technology patents during the next five years will have a material adverse effect on our business 
the key raw materials used in our united solar ovonic segment business are primarily stainless steel  high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane  and polymer materials 
we believe that we have adequate sources for the supply of key raw materials and components for our pv module manufacturing needs 
we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
the cost of certain raw materials  in particular stainless steel and resin based polymer materials  have risen dramatically over the last several years  and we are actively managing these costs through purchasing strategies including higher volume purchasing  and product design and operating improvements 
for example  we have qualified additional stainless steel suppliers to diversify our supply base and reduce cost 
our operations are not impacted by the shortage of polysilicon a key raw material for conventional pv products that is affecting most of our competitors through higher costs and limited availability 
our backlog of orders for pv products was  and  at june  and june   respectively 
in fiscal  we expect to recognize all of our existing backlog as revenue 
the principal reason for the change in backlog is an expected temporary  substantial decline for of sales of our pv modules to sit 
we are presently reallocating production to other customers in our existing backlog and seeking additional sales to offset the impact of sit 
additionally  the reduction in backlog was impacted by a change in our business practices to focus on long term supply agreements  in which  consistent with industry norms  we accept firm orders from our customers on a more current basis than our past practice 
only firm orders are included in backlog 
our united solar ovonic segment is headquartered in auburn hills  michigan and has manufacturing facilities in auburn hills  michigan and tijuana  mexico 
to meet present and expected demand  we plan to rapidly expand our manufacturing capacity from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw by by adding new manufacturing facilities  as well as constantly improving our products and process efficiencies 
our second manufacturing facility in auburn hills  with an expected capacity of mw per annum  is anticipated to begin operation in fall this facility will duplicate our existing auburn hills facility  manufacturing pv cells and finished pv modules 
we are also presently constructing a manufacturing facility in greenville  michigan  which is expected to begin operation in late this facility will manufacture pv cells  with an expected initial capacity of mw per annum  which will then be used in the assembly of finished pv modules at facilities in mexico and elsewhere 
in addition  we recently announced that we are adding a second mw per annum pv cell manufacturing facility at our greenville site  which is expected to begin operation in mid ovonic battery segment our ovonic battery segment designs  develops  manufactures and sells rechargeable nimh batteries and battery materials internally and through third party relationships ie  joint ventures and licenses 
this business is founded upon our pioneering rechargeable nimh battery technology  which we developed and patented 
we commercialize this and related technologies principally through our cobasys joint venture and third party licensing arrangements with nimh battery manufacturers throughout the world 
we also manufacture and sell proprietary positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials used to manufacture nimh batteries 
we conduct this business through our subsidiary  ovonic battery company  inc of which we own of the common stock  and the remainder is owned by honda motor company  ltd 
 sanoh industrial co  ltd 
and sanyo 
nimh batteries are rechargeable energy storage solutions offering high power  long cycle life and maintenance free operation 
they are adaptable to a broad range of consumer  transportation and stationary applications 
products utilizing our nimh battery technology compete with lead acid batteries and products based on other rechargeable battery technologies  such as nickel cadmium and lithium ion 
nimh batteries produce superior power for their weight and volume and have a longer cycle life compared to lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries 
in addition  nimh batteries are maintenance free  have no memory effect and do not contain cadmium or lead  both environmentally hazardous substances 
nimh technology has numerous advantages over lithium ion technology  such as lower cost  greater safety and improved durability and abuse tolerance 
while lithium ion batteries are used in many laptop computers and cell phones  we believe nimh batteries are preferable for many mass market consumer and retail products incorporating rechargeable batteries where safety and cost are important factors 
nimh batteries are also the preferred technology for manufacturers of hybrid electric vehicles hevs or hybrids due to their performance  cost  safety and durability 
we have an extensive patent portfolio in nimh battery technology with us and foreign counterparts covering materials  manufacturing processes and product design  including basic patents that have broad coverage 
we are also regularly adding new patents to our portfolio based upon our continuing research and development activities 
as a result  we do not believe that the expiration of any of our nimh battery patents during the next five years will have a material adverse effect on our business 
the following paragraphs describe our principal commercialization activities for our nimh battery technologies cobasys our cobasys joint venture designs  develops  manufactures and sells advanced nimh battery system solutions for transportation markets  including hevs  electric vehicles and volt applications  in addition to stationary back up power supply systems for uninterruptible power supply  telecom and distributed generation requirements 
cobasys has recently begun commercial production of its advanced nimh battery system for general motors corporation s first hybrid suv  the saturn vue green line 
we own of cobasys  and chevron technology ventures llc chevron  a subsidiary of chevron corporation  owns the remaining 
cobasys operates independently of its joint venture partners  although each partner participates on cobasys managing board 
as part of this joint venture arrangement  we have licensed certain technology to cobasys as described below and contributed intellectual property  licenses  production processes and know how 
chevron is presently funding cobasys operations by acquiring preferred interests in cobasys  for which it is entitled to a priority right of repayment 
cobasys has obtained  from chevron for preferred interests through june   and chevron is committed under the cobasys operating agreement to continue funding the approved operating budgets through december beginning in january  the joint venture partners will be required to make capital contributions as necessary to fund approved operating budgets in proportion to their percentage interests  subject to the terms of the cobasys operating agreement 
we have granted cobasys a royalty free  exclusive license to our nimh battery technology for certain applications  including vehicle propulsion and ancillary vehicle applications  telecommunications applications and uninterruptible power supply applications 
certain licenses that we had entered into prior to cobasys formation as discussed below were excepted from this exclusivity  and we retain nonexclusive rights to manufacture in china and india cylindrical batteries for two and three wheeled transportation applications for sale worldwide 
cobasys principal competitors for hev batteries are panasonic ev energy company peve an affiliate of toyota motor corporation  which provides nimh batteries for toyota s hevs and the honda civic hybrid  and sanyo  which provides nimh batteries for the ford escape hybrid  the honda accord hybrid and the mercury mariner hybrid 
peve provides its nimh batteries under licenses from cobasys and ecd  under which royalties are payable to cobasys on north american battery sales and fully paid up with respect to all other battery sales 
sanyo provides its nimh batteries under a royalty bearing license from ovonic battery as described below 
cobasys is headquartered in orion township  michigan and has a  square foot state of the art production facility with automated manufacturing equipment in springboro  ohio  which will have the capacity to produce three million battery modules annually when fully equipped 
the manufacturing facility is iso ts  iso  iso and tl certified 
licensing our recent licensing activities have focused on consumer applications 
we have licensed our nimh battery technology to major nimh battery manufacturers  principally for consumer applications  on a royalty bearing  nonexclusive basis 
we are presently receiving royalties from manufacturers who are currently producing nimh batteries using our technology 
royalties from sanyo represented and of our revenues in this segment in the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
our royalty bearing licenses generally provide for upfront nonrefundable license fees and  depending on factors such as geographical scope and fields of application  require licensees to pay us a royalty of for consumer applications or for transportation applications of the selling price of the nimh batteries 
certain licensees  because of their relatively small production capacities  have paid modest nonrefundable upfront license fees  but are required to pay royalty rates considerably higher than and to pay additional license fees as their sales of nimh batteries increase  or have been granted substantially narrower rights to geographical areas in which licensed products can be made or sold 
based upon our current nimh battery patent portfolio  we believe that we will continue to generate royalty revenues based on licensing these patents at least through prior to cobasys formation  we entered into royalty bearing  nonexclusive license agreements for the manufacture and sale of nimh batteries with sanyo  varta automotive  walsin technology corporation  sanoh  nan ya plastics corporation  gp batteries international limited  toshiba battery co  ltd  hyundai motor company  saft group  the united states advanced battery consortium and our rare earth ovonic joint ventures 
among these licensees  sanyo  gp batteries and saft are presently manufacturing nimh batteries for four wheel vehicle transportation applications 
materials manufacturing we produce proprietary high performance positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials for use in nimh batteries  which we sell to licensees of our nimh battery technology 
while these licensees are not required to purchase our materials in order to manufacture nimh batteries using the licensed nimh technology  our positive electrode materials offer advantages such as higher capacity and power  greater cycle life  high temperature performance and lower costs 
we conduct our manufacturing operations at an automated facility in troy  michigan 
the key raw materials used in our nickel hydroxide business are primarily nickel and cobalt 
all of the raw materials used are generally readily available from numerous sources  but interruptions in production or delivery of key raw materials could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations 
ecd segment our ecd segment consists of our ovonyx joint venture  our production technology and machine building division  and our emerging technologies  including ovonic solid hydrogen storage  ovonic metal hydride fuel cell  ovonic optical memory  ovonic cognitive computer and ovonic quantum control technologies  for which we are continuing research and development activities in an effort to reach full scale commercialization 
ovonyx our ovonyx joint venture is commercializing our proprietary ovonic universal memory oum technology through various licensing and product development arrangements 
oum is a basic  new type of nonvolatile memory that can replace conventional nonvolatile or flash memory in applications requiring retention of stored data when power is turned off  including cell phones  pdas  digital cameras and microelectronics 
oum  which is also known in the semiconductor industry as phase change random access memory  pram and pc ram  offers several advantages over conventional nonvolatile memory  including significantly faster write time  greater scalability  lower power utilization and longer life  and is compatible with existing cmos manufacturing processes 
we own of the common stock of ovonyx 
tyler lowrey formerly chief technology officer of micron technology  inc  intel capital a subsidiary of intel corporation and other investors own the remainder 
as part of this joint venture arrangement  we have licensed all oum technology to ovonyx on an exclusive  worldwide basis and contributed intellectual property  licenses  production processes and know how 
in addition to our equity interest in ovonyx  we are entitled to receive of ovonyx annual gross revenue 
we have licensed back from ovonyx  on an exclusive  royalty bearing basis  certain technology relating to our ovonic cognitive computer technology 
ovonyx has entered into royalty bearing  nonexclusive license agreements with intel corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  elpida memory  inc  stmicroelectronics nv  bae systems and nanochip  inc to produce oum products 
under most of these agreements  ovonyx is also participating in joint development programs to assist in the commercialization of oum phase change memory products 
while bae has announced a product based on oum technology  ovonyx has not yet realized any royalty revenues since its licensees have not begun commercial sale of products based on oum 
production technology and machine building division we design  develop and manufacture automated production equipment based on our proprietary process technologies  particularly our vacuum deposition and large scale  roll to roll manufacturing processes 
these business activities are closely aligned with our product commercialization activities  so that we have developed and enhanced manufacturing capabilities concurrently with product development ie  short run capabilities for limited production products to volume manufacturing for commercial products 
this division has designed  developed and manufactured multiple generations of photovoltaic production lines 
it is currently focused on producing the equipment to expand manufacturing capacity in our united solar ovonic segment from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by emerging technologies our core business strategy has been to develop new technologies addressing important societal needs based upon our patented materials  products and processes  and then seek to commercialize these new technologies through licensing arrangements and manufacturing activities directly and through joint ventures 
we are seeking to bring our emerging technologies  including those discussed below  to full scale commercialization through this strategy 
these technologies are subject to further development and will require substantial additional funding to reach commercial product status 
we seek to offset our funding requirements associated with these activities by obtaining third party funding through strategic alliances and government contracts 
presently  we are actively seeking additional strategic funding for several of our emerging technologies 
ovonic solid hydrogen storage technologies 
hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel source that yields more energy per unit of weight than any other combustible fuel  but the inability to store hydrogen safely and efficiently has impeded its development as a practical fuel alternative 
we are developing a practical approach to storing hydrogen in a solid metal matrix at low pressures using a family of new  efficient metal hydrides based upon our pioneering technology relating to atomically engineered materials 
our solid hydrogen storage solutions have several advantages over conventional gaseous and liquid storage solutions  including improved convenience and greater safety due to our technology s low pressure refilling and storage capabilities 
these materials can be packaged in a variety of sizes and shapes to meet application requirements  and we plan to develop solid hydrogen storage systems for commercial use in stationary  portable power and transportation applications 
the us department of transportation has approved  through a special exemption  the transport  manufacture  labeling  sale  and use of portable canisters containing our solid hydrogen storage materials  allowing hydrogen storage capacity up to standard liters 
we are presently manufacturing pre production volumes of portable hydrogen canisters in rochester hills  michigan  and have sold over  canisters of various sizes to multiple customers 
additionally  we have successfully converted an original equipment liter internal combustion engine in a toyota prius to run on hydrogen using our solid hydrogen storage system 
this modified prius represents our third generation of vehicle propulsion conversions and demonstrates our solid hydrogen storage technology using two liter hydrogen storage vessels  which store up to kilograms of hydrogen to provide nearly a mile vehicle range 
refueling at  psi to capacity currently takes approximately minutes 
our current research and development activities are focused on reducing the weight and cost of the hydrogen storage materials 
ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technologies 
fuel cells are environmentally clean power generators in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity  with water and heat as the only byproducts 
our ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technology is a fundamentally new approach that combines the best features of both fuel cell and battery technologies for a new  lower cost solution in comparison to conventional proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells  which require expensive platinum catalysts 
this approach results in significant benefits  including reduced costs  enhanced low temperature performance and intrinsic storage of energy in the fuel cell stack  which provides instant start capability and the opportunity to store regenerative braking energy for automotive applications independently from the battery currently used in hybrid vehicles utilizing pem fuel cells 
we believe these benefits make our technology particularly robust and versatile for applications  such as automotive applications  requiring performance under harsh or varying conditions 
our current research and development activities are focused on military and stationary applications 
ovonic optical memory technologies 
we have developed phase change rewritable optical memory solutions based on our pioneering amorphous materials technology 
our technology is used in the rewritable version of cds and dvds  as well as either of the new  high definition digital video disc formats  blu ray and hd dvd 
we have licensed our technology to a number of data storage media companies on a royalty bearing  nonexclusive basis 
we are currently developing new uses for our ovonic optical phase change technology under a three year cost sharing contract awarded in by the national institute of standards and technology nist to develop optical switching devices for active optical routing devices in digital signal processing 
ovonic cognitive computer and ovonic quantum control technologies 
we are developing a multifunctional approach to computing which incorporates nanostructural materials deposited as thin films used to make devices which  when fully developed  are expected to have the capability to execute ordinary arithmetic and logic operations as well as advanced functions such as nonbinary processing and higher mathematics 
when commercially developed  the devices could be used in larger numbers than implementations using conventional technologies in densely interconnected parallel circuits to enable more powerful neural networks and cognitive processors 
we are also developing thin film devices that have functionality beyond transistors and can be used for switching and control in cognitive processors and potentially in oum and other types of memories and more general integrated circuits 
our technology and intellectual property our technology and related intellectual property are the foundation of our business activities 
the principal markets in which we compete the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets are characterized by rapid change and competition driven by technological and product performance advantages 
we have driven some of this activity through our pioneering materials  product and production process technologies 
at the same time  we are actively engaged in product design and development to commercialize and improve our materials  products and production processes 
research and development expenditures we have a multi disciplinary business  scientific and technical organization engaged in research and development activities in which we invent new technologies and improve our existing materials  products and production processes 
we have funded these activities directly and through third party funding  including strategic alliances and government contracts  as summarized for the three years ended june  in the following table direct research and development expenditures year ended june  sponsored by industrial partners  government agencies and licensees    sponsored by us    total    direct research and development expenditures exclude allocation of patents  depreciation and general and administrative expenses 
all of our research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in our consolidated statement of operations as cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research 
competition since our businesses are based upon our pioneering technologies that offer fundamental solutions in the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets  we compete not only at the product level for market share but also at the technology level for market acceptance 
our competition includes well established conventional technologies  other alternative technology solutions and other technologies within an alternative solution 
for example  our pv technology competes with conventional electricity generation technologies  such as gas and coal  alternative electricity generation technologies  such as wind and nuclear  and other solar technologies  such as crystalline products 
our business competitors include some of the world s largest industrial companies  many of which are pursuing new technology solutions in addition to their well established conventional technologies 
we believe that we have derived a key business and technological advantage for over years through our research and development activities by continuously inventing new technologies and improving our existing materials  products and production processes 
these activities are intended to enhance the performance  efficiency  cost and environmental advantages of products based on our technologies as compared to conventional and alternative solutions 
we diligently prosecute patents and maintain an extensive patent portfolio to protect our technology position 
however  even as we successfully pursue these research and development activities  some of our technologies  particularly in the alternative energy generation and energy storage markets  presently face commercial barriers as compared to well established conventional technologies  including infrastructural barriers  customer transition costs and higher manufacturing costs associated with present production volumes 
the competitiveness of products based on our technologies in these areas is typically enhanced by external factors  including rising energy costs  concerns regarding energy security and governmental incentives at the customer level 
our long term goal is to compete directly in energy markets without subsidies 
patents and intellectual property protection of our technologies is a key business imperative 
accordingly  we have developed an extensive patent portfolio consisting of over us patents and over foreign counterparts including patents assigned to a joint venture partner  to which we are regularly adding new patents based upon our continuing research and development activities 
importantly  our portfolio includes numerous basic and fundamental patents applicable to each of our business segments  covering not only materials  but also the production technology and products we develop 
based on the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio  we believe that our proprietary patent position is sustainable notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents 
we do not expect the expiration of any patents to materially affect the business prospects of any of our business segments 
our employees as of september   we and our consolidated subsidiaries had a total of employees in the us and employees outside of the us these numbers do not include employees of our joint ventures or licensees

item a risk factors we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
since our founding  we have incurred substantial net losses in connection with the research  development and commercialization of products based on our technologies and  at june   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately  our ability to achieve profitability in the future is uncertain and will depend largely on the successful commercialization of our products  as to which there can be no assurance 
if we do not achieve or sustain profitability or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
we expect that we will need to obtain significant additional financing to continue to operate our business  including significant capital expenditures to increase our production capacity  and financing may be unavailable or available only on disadvantageous terms 
we have in the past experienced substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and have required significant financing  including equity financing and financing provided through capital and operating leases of facilities  in order to pursue the commercialization of products based on our technologies 
we expect that we will continue to need significant financing to operate our business  including capital expenditures to expand our production capacity 
in particular  we believe that we will require additional funding for manufacturing capacity expansion in our united solar ovonic segment from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that the terms of such additional financing  if available  will be acceptable to us 
if additional financing is not available or not available on terms acceptable to us  our ability to fund our operations  develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  maintain our research and development efforts or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be significantly impaired 
we are rapidly expanding our manufacturing capacity for pv products in order to meet expected demand  and our revenues and profits will depend upon our ability to successfully complete this expansion and then to sell our pv products at higher volumes to match our expanded capacity 
we plan to expand our manufacturing capacity from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by this expansion plan includes adding new facilities in auburn hills  michigan which is expected to begin operation in fall and greenville  michigan the first facility of which is expected to begin operation in late and the second in mid 
we are designing  developing  manufacturing  installing and testing the equipment for this expansion through our production technology and machine building division 
we may experience delays  additional or unexpected costs and other adverse events in connection with our capacity expansion projects  including those associated with the equipment we are providing 
additionally  there can be no assurance that market demand will align with our expanding manufacturing capacity or that our marketing capabilities at the expanded manufacturing volumes will be successful 
as a result  we may not be able to realize revenues and profits based upon the expected capacity  or we may experience delays or reductions in these revenues and profits  and our business could be materially adversely affected 
a portion of our revenues and profits are dependent upon licensing arrangements and joint ventures  and our licensees and joint venture partners may be unwilling or unable to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
we have entered into licensing and joint venture agreements with established industrial companies in order to develop and commercialize certain products based on our technologies 
any revenues or profits which may be derived by us from these licensing and joint venture agreements will be substantially dependent upon the willingness and ability of our licensees and joint venture partners to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such commercialization will be successful 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our joint ventures will continue to operate 
if our joint venture partners provide additional financing to our joint ventures  it may be on terms that result in a reduction in our ownership interest in the joint ventures or that otherwise reduce any profits we may realize from the joint ventures 
if any of our joint ventures are terminated  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new joint venture partners to continue the activities of the terminated joint venture 
if our licensees and joint venture partners are unwilling or unable to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies  or if any of our joint ventures are terminated  we may not be able to realize revenues and profits based on our technologies and our business could be materially adversely affected 
additional research and development efforts will be required before certain products based on our technologies can be manufactured and sold commercially  and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
additional research and development efforts by us  our licensees or our joint ventures will be required before certain products based on our technologies may be manufactured and sold commercially 
the commercialization of products based on our technologies depends upon consumer acceptance and the achievement and verification of the overall performance  cost  reliability  efficiency and safety of the products 
there can be no assurance that such research and development efforts will be successful or that we  our licensees or our joint ventures will be able to develop commercial applications for our products and technologies 
further  the areas in which we are developing technologies and products are characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
rapid technological development may result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive 
if future products based on our technologies cannot be developed for manufacture and sold commercially or our products become obsolete or noncompetitive  we may be unable to recover our investments or achieve profitability 
in addition  the commercialization schedule may be delayed if we  our licensees or our joint ventures experience delays in meeting development goals  if products based on our technologies exhibit technical defects  or if we  our licensees or our joint ventures are unable to meet cost or performance goals 
in this event  potential purchasers of products based on our technologies may choose alternative technologies and any delays could allow potential competitors to gain market advantages 
it is uncertain that the market will accept our products once the technology has been developed and commercial scale manufacturing has been achieved 
there can be no assurance that products based on our technologies will be perceived as being superior to existing products or new products being developed by competing companies or that such products will otherwise be accepted by consumers 
the market prices for products based on our technologies may exceed the prices of competitive products based on existing technologies or new products based on technologies currently under development by competitors 
there can be no assurance that the prices of products based on our technologies will be perceived by consumers as cost effective or that the prices of such products will be competitive with existing products or with other new products or technologies 
if consumers do not accept products based on our technologies  we may be unable to recover our investments or achieve profitability 
we and our joint ventures and licensees may not be able to manufacture products based on our technologies successfully on a commercial scale 
there can be no assurance that we and our joint ventures and licensees will be able to successfully manufacture products based on our technologies 
in order to produce products on a commercial scale  we and our joint ventures and licensees will be required to establish or significantly increase manufacturing capabilities currently being used to produce certain of our products 
although substantially all of our joint venture partners and licensees have experience in commercial scale manufacturing  we have little such experience and there can be no assurance that we or our joint ventures and licensees will expand or establish capabilities for manufacturing products beyond those presently in existence 
if commercial scale manufacturing of products based on our technologies is not achieved  we may be unable to recover our investments or achieve profitability 
we and our joint ventures and licensees may experience performance problems with key suppliers or subcontractors 
we and our joint ventures and licensees are highly dependent on the continued services of a limited number of key suppliers and subcontractors 
the loss of any of these suppliers and subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on us and on our joint ventures and licensees 
there can be no assurance that existing relationships with key suppliers and subcontractors will continue on acceptable terms and  if not continued  our business could be materially adversely affected 
other companies  many of which have greater resources than we have  may develop competing products or technologies which cause products based on our technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
we and our joint ventures and licensees currently compete with firms  both domestic and foreign  that perform research and development  as well as firms that manufacture and sell products 
in addition  we expect additional potential competitors to enter the markets for our products in the future 
some of these current and potential competitors are among the largest industrial companies in the world with longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  significantly more well established business organizations and product lines and significantly greater resources and research and development staff and facilities 
there can be no assurance that one or more such companies will not succeed in developing technologies or products that will become available for commercial sale prior to our products  that will have performance superior to products based on our technologies or that would otherwise render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we fail to compete successfully  our business would suffer and we may lose or be unable to gain market share 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
we historically have entered into agreements with a relatively small number of major customers throughout the world 
our five largest customers represented approximately and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  excluding the recognition of a one time  noncash license revenue of approximately  in our ovonic battery segment in our revenues would decrease substantially if we were to lose any major customer and unable to offset this loss through reallocation of production or additional sales 
adverse business or financial conditions affecting the automotive industry may have a material adverse effect on our cobasys joint venture and our nimh battery business 
cobasys  our joint venture with chevron corporation  designs  manufactures and sells high power commercial nimh batteries and systems for hybrid electric vehicles  or hevs 
the principal customers for the nimh batteries and systems manufactured by cobasys are the major domestic and international automotive manufacturers 
certain of these manufacturers have in recent years experienced static or reduced revenues  increased costs  loss of market share  labor issues and other business and financial challenges 
adverse business or financial conditions affecting individual automotive manufacturers or the automotive industry generally could have a material adverse effect on our cobasys joint venture and our nimh battery business 
automotive manufacturers may discontinue or delay their planned introduction of hevs as a result of adverse changes in their financial condition or other factors 
automotive manufacturers may also seek alternative battery systems from other suppliers which may be more cost effective or require fewer modifications in standard manufacturing processes than the battery systems manufactured by cobasys 
we or cobasys may also experience delays or losses with respect to the collection of payments due from customers in the automotive industry experiencing financial difficulties 
our government product development and research contracts may be terminated by unilateral government action  or we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new government contracts to replace those which have been terminated or completed 
we have several government product development and research contracts 
any revenues or profits which may be derived by us from these contracts will be substantially dependent upon the government agencies willingness to continue to devote their financial resources to our research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such research and development efforts will be successful 
our government contracts may be terminated for the convenience of the government at any time  even if we have fully performed our obligations under the contracts 
upon a termination for convenience  we would generally only be entitled to recover certain eligible costs and expenses we had incurred prior to termination and would not be entitled to any other payments or damages 
therefore  if government product development and research contracts are terminated or completed and we are unsuccessful in obtaining replacement government contracts  our revenues and profits may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
the reduction or elimination of government incentives related to solar power could cause our revenues to decline 
today  the cost of solar power exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in most locations 
as a result  federal  state and local government bodies in many countries  most notably germany  japan  italy  spain and the united states  have provided incentives in the form of rebates  tax credits and other incentives to end users  distributors  system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy to reduce dependency on other forms of energy 
these government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated 
reductions in  or eliminations or expirations of  incentives related to solar power could result in decreased demand for our solar modules and lower our revenue 
we may suffer the loss of key personnel or may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of a limited number of skilled managers  scientists and technicians 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our success will depend upon  among other factors  the recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing employees or to attract and retain additional personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel in industrial  academic and nonprofit research sectors 
high raw material costs may continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability and our ability to successfully develop our emerging technologies 
higher costs for certain raw materials and commodities  principally steel  resin based polymers  and nickel  as well as higher energy costs  had an adverse impact on our operating results in and could continue to negatively impact our profitability in while we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher raw material  commodity and energy costs  there can be no assurances such measures will be successful 
in addition  no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these cost increases or any future cost increases will not have a larger adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position than currently anticipated 
additionally  certain of our emerging technologies utilize high cost raw materials 
as part of our continuing research and development activities  we are attempting to substantially reduce these costs through material reduction and substitution strategies 
there can be no assurances that we will succeed in these cost reduction efforts  which are essential for the development of our emerging technologies 
we may become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings which may reach unfavorable resolutions 
we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of legal proceedings  the outcome of any such proceeding could be unfavorable  and we may choose to make payments or enter into other arrangements  to settle such proceedings 
failure to settle such proceedings could require us to pay damages or other expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to legal proceedings in the past involving the validity and enforceability of certain of our patents 
while such patent related legal proceedings have been resolved  such proceedings can require the expenditure of substantial management time and financial resources and can adversely affect our financial performance 
there can be no assurance that we will not be a party to other legal proceedings in the future 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws  rules and regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  we generate hazardous materials and other wastes that are disposed of at licensed disposal facilities 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology including our trade secrets and other confidential information 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for products based on our technologies 
our policy is to seek to protect our products and technologies by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our ability to maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents 
our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products and technologies 
in addition  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technologies 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property 
because of the extensive time required for development and commercialization of products based on our technologies  it is possible that  before these products can be commercialized  any related patents may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantages of these patents and making it unlikely that we will be able to recover investments we have made to develop our technologies and products based on our technologies 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  agents and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with us 
these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
our agreements with employees also provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property 
individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms 
in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
to the extent that our employees or consultants use technology or know how owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions 
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information 
the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents 
to counter infringement or unauthorized use  we may be required to file patent infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the united states patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
in addition  during the course of this litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not prevail in any litigation or interference proceeding in which we are involved 
even if we do prevail  these proceedings can be expensive and distract our management 
third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our products or technologies 
our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents and proprietary rights 
in the united states and most other countries  patent applications are published months after filing 
as a result  there may be patents of which we are unaware  and avoiding patent infringement may be difficult 
we may inadvertently infringe third party patents or patent applications 
these third parties could bring claims against us that  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if resolved against us  could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we and our joint venture partners and licensees could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of products based on our technologies in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe  unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with products based on our technologies 
even if we were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of an infringement 
under some circumstances in the united states  these damages could be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or damages paid to the patent holder 
any successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of products based on our technologies in other markets not covered by the infringement action 
furthermore  we may suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal  nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder 
the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  may be significant 
as a result  any infringement action against us would likely harm our competitive position  be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel

the complaint alleges that varta has engaged in unfair trade practices by manufacturing and importing infringing batteries into the united states and requests that itc exclude those infringing products from further importation into the united states 
the complaint was filed under section of the trade act of which prohibits unfair methods of competition in import trade and is traditionally used to enforce patents and trademarks against international encroachments

overview we invent  design  develop and commercialize materials  products and production processes for the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets 
our materials  products and production processes originate from the pioneering work of mr 
stanford r 
ovshinsky  principal inventor and our president  chief scientist and technologist  in materials science at the atomic or nanostructure level  principally amorphous and disordered materials 
in particular  we manufacture for commercial sale thin film photovoltaic pv modules and positive electrode nickel hydroxide for nickel metal hydride nimh batteries  and license our nimh battery technology  which is used in commercial products 
our principal joint ventures cobasys llc and ovonyx  inc are also commercializing our nimh battery and ovonic unified memory oum technologies  and battery products manufactured by cobasys are commercially available 
at the same time  we continue our research and development activities for our emerging technologies in order to bring these technologies to full scale commercialization 
we seek third party funding to offset our funding requirements for these activities 
these business activities represent application of our overall business strategy  which is to invent  design and develop materials  products and production processes and then commercialize these materials  products and production processes internally and through third party relationships  such as licenses and joint ventures 
accordingly  our results reflect our approach to commercialization of a particular technology  as well as the commercial readiness of that technology  and consideration should be given to the following key factors when reviewing our results for the periods discussed we are engaged in full scale manufacturing and sale of our pv products through our united solar ovonic segment  and our consolidated financial results are driven primarily by the performance of this segment 
our united solar ovonic segment accounted for of our total revenue in fiscal compared to for the first full fiscal year in which we consolidated the results of our subsidiary  united solar ovonic 
additionally  our united solar ovonic segment generated operating income of  in fiscal year  while our other two segments had combined operating losses of  which we seek to fund as described below 
given the projected growth of our photovoltaic business see below relative to our other business segments  our overall success in the foreseeable future will be aligned primarily with the performance of our united solar ovonic segment and subject to the risks of that business 
we are rapidly expanding manufacturing capacity for our pv products to meet the rapid growth in the alternative energy generation market in general and the solar market in particular  and we will require significant capital to fund this expansion 
we are expanding our pv module manufacturing capacity from mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by we are funding the initial phases of this expansion with the proceeds from the common stock offering  which we completed in march we will require additional funding for subsequent phases through  which we may obtain from equity and debt financing  business agreements and other sources 
we are commercializing our nimh battery and oum technologies principally through nonconsolidated joint ventures  and we account for our interests in these joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
our principal joint ventures cobasys and ovonyx were founded upon technologies that we pioneered  and then formed to further develop and commercialize these technologies 
in each case  we participate in the business as equity holders but do not directly manage or have a controlling interest in the entity 
we have not reported any earnings or losses from cobasys because our only contributions to cobasys have been noncash items  including intellectual property and know how 
we have contributed intellectual property and cash to ovonyx  and have reported losses up to our cash investment in ovonyx 
our interests in cobasys and ovonyx were recorded at zero on our balance sheet at june  we are continuing to further develop our emerging technologies  and we will continue to generate losses  and at the same time require substantial additional funding  as we seek to bring these technologies to commercial product status 
we have successfully brought our pv and nimh technologies from pioneering technologies to commercial products  and ovonyx has been collaborating successfully with a number of semiconductor companies to commercialize oum 
we are utilizing a similar strategy for our current emerging technologies  such as ovonic solid hydrogen systems  ovonic metal hydride fuel cell  ovonic optical memory  ovonic cognitive computer and ovonic quantum control  as we engage in research and development activities to define marketable technologies that can result in commercial products 
we expect to record losses associated with these activities at this stage while we seek to offset our funding requirements with third party funding  including strategic alliances and government contracts 
our third party funding for these activities has declined in recent years  principally due to the restructuring of certain strategic relationships and completion of certain government contracts  and we are presently actively seeking additional strategic funding for several of our emerging technologies 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance 
in evaluating our business  we use operating income and cash flow from operations as key performance metrics 
we also use production capacity  measured in mw per annum  as a key performance metric for our united solar ovonic segment  particularly in connection with the manufacturing capacity expansion in this segment 
results of operations the year over year comparisons contained in this section exclude an extraordinary item and discontinued operations see other income expense  extraordinary item  and discontinued operations  below

the increases in revenues and expenses in were primarily attributable to increased volume of pv products to meet market demand 
gross profit margin on product sales increased to in from in  reflecting increased production and sales and improved absorption of fixed costs as we continue to improve manufacturing production toward an expected capacity of mw per annum at our existing auburn hills facility 
operating  general and administrative expenses and patent expenses increased due principally to increased production volume and manufacturing capacity expansion activities including new hiring 
we expect a temporary  substantial decline for of sales of our pv modules to solar integrated technologies inc sit 
we are presently reallocating production to other customers in our existing backlog and seeking additional sales to offset the impact of sit 
the combined product development and research expenses decreased due principally to reduced activities under product development agreements with the us air force to develop new products for space and airship applications and the national renewable energy laboratory 
revenues under these product development agreements also decreased due to the reduced activities 
we continue to incur product development and research expenses to improve the throughput of our pv cell manufacturing equipment  reduce the cost of production and increase the sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of our pv modules

revenues from product development agreements decreased primarily due to the elimination in of a product development agreement with ovonic hydrogen systems in connection with our acquisition of our partner s interest in that company  in compared to  in  and completion of a hydrogen systems development contract with tacom zero in compared to  in  partially offset by increased activities  in compared to  in under contracts with nist related to optical switching and organic electroluminescent devices technologies 
other operating revenues consist primarily of services  facilities and miscellaneous administrative and laboratory and machine shop services provided to some of our nonconsolidated affiliates

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures associated with expansion of our united solar ovonic segment s manufacturing capacity and support our working capital requirements  as well as to fund the further development of our emerging technologies 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which principally represent the proceeds from our march offering of common stock and cash flows from operating activities at our united solar ovonic segment 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend to use the net proceeds from our march common stock offering for our pv manufacturing expansion  which includes construction of two mw manufacturing facilities in greenville  michigan  and general corporate purposes 
we will require additional funding for this expansion through  which we may obtain from equity and debt financing  business agreements and other sources 
as of june   we had  consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consisting of certificates of deposits  variable rate corporate bonds vrcb s  auction rate certificates arc s  corporate notes and money market funds 
all short term investments are classified as available for sale 
these short term investments have maturities up to months  except for the arc s which have maturities from to years 
both the vrcb s and arc s resemble short term instruments due to the periodic interest rate reset and put options 
at june   we had consolidated working capital of  which included a cash and short term investments balance of cash flows net cash used in our operating activities was  in as compared to  in reflecting improved cash flow from operations at our united solar ovonic segment and the receipt in of a one time  nonrefundable license fee of  as part of a settlement of certain patent infringement disputes 
net cash used in investing activities was  in as compared to  in this increase was due to net purchases  of investments plus purchases  of property  plant and equipment in this increase in capital spending  in compared to  in was principally associated with expansion of our united solar ovonic segment s manufacturing capacity 
net cash provided by our financing activities was  in as compared to  in  primarily as a result of our march common stock offering in which we raised net proceeds of approximately for details of our cash flows  see the consolidated statement of cash flows in our consolidated financial statements 
the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements at june  short term borrowings as of june   we have a line of credit with lasalle bank midwest na in the amount of  this line of credit provides a mechanism for obtaining letters of credit and entering into foreign exchange transactions

at june   we had outstanding letters of credit of  against the line of credit 
joint ventures we do not presently provide funding to either of our principal joint ventures  cobasys and ovonyx 
chevron  our partner in cobasys  is presently funding cobasys operations and is committed under the cobasys operating agreement to continue funding approved operating budgets through december beginning in january  the joint venture partners will be required to make capital contributions as necessary to fund approved operating budgets in proportion to their percentage interests  subject to the terms of the cobasys operating agreement 
ovonyx does not currently require financial support because it has generated sufficient funds for its operations through licensing activities 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations include the following maturities in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations      operating leases     purchase obligations   long term retirement   total      this table includes contractual obligations associated with the early stages of the construction of a mw manufacturing facility in greenville  michigan  and we expect to incur additional contractual obligations related to this construction  which is expected to be completed in late critical accounting estimates and significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a  summary of accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
however  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation effective july   ecd adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the grant 
this statement was adopted using the modified prospective method of application  which requires us to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis 
therefore  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new share based grants  expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of grants that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods 
ecd records the fair value of stock based compensation grants as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  ecd applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
ecd uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  ecd considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees 
forfeiture rates are based on the company s historical data for stock option forfeitures 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  ecd applied apb to its stock based compensation awards to employees 
had compensation costs for ecd s stock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
r  the company s net income loss and net income loss per share for the years ended june  and would have changed as follows year ended june  income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  income loss from continuing operations   net income loss   basic and diluted income loss per common share 

total net stock based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options previously granted 
compensation expense attributable to net stock based compensation in fiscal was  increasing both basic and diluted loss 
per share 
as of june   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock grants was  and the related weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
warranty liability our accrued warranty liability increased to  at june  from  at june   due to increased product sales in our united solar ovonic segment 
see note e  liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements 
we generally provide a year product warranty on power output on all uni solar products installed as part of pre engineered solutions 
our accrued warranty liability also includes warranties previously provided on our machine building and equipment products 
allowance for uncollectible accounts our allowance for uncollectible accounts increased to  at june  from  at june   due principally to the increase in product sales in our united solar ovonic segment 
see note b  accounts receivable  to our consolidated financial statements 
government contracts  reserves and liabilities our reserves and liabilities for government contracts decreased to  at june  from  at june   due principally to an aggregate  reduction in our estimated liability in  which was partially offset by additional accrued costs for work performed in under government contracts 
the reduction reflects partial resolution of an audit of certain government contracts by the defense contract audit agency and adjustment of a reserve to better reflect our residual royalty obligations under an advanced development agreement
