item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview j 
alexander s corporation the company operates upscale casual dining restaurants 
at january   the company operated j 
alexander s restaurants in states 
the company s net sales are derived primarily from the sale of food and alcoholic beverages in its restaurants 
revenues have also been generated by the sale and redemption of gift cards  and from service fees and other income related to gift cards and certificates 
the company s strategy is for j 
alexander s restaurants to compete in the restaurant industry by providing guests with outstanding professional service  high quality food  and an attractive environment with an upscale  high energy ambiance 
quality is emphasized throughout j 
alexander s operations and substantially all menu items are prepared on the restaurant premises using fresh  high quality ingredients 
the company s goal is for each j 
alexander s restaurant to be perceived by guests in its market as a market leader in each of the categories above 
j 
alexander s restaurants offer a contemporary american menu designed to appeal to a wide range of consumer tastes 
however  the company believes its restaurants are most popular with more discriminating guests with higher discretionary incomes 
j 
alexander s typically does not advertise in the media and relies on each restaurant to increase sales by building its reputation as an outstanding dining establishment 
the company has generally been successful in achieving sales increases in its restaurants over time using this strategy 
the restaurant industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  changes in general economic conditions  public safety conditions or concerns  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost of food products  labor and energy  and governmental regulations 
because of these factors  the company s management believes it is of critical importance to the company s success to effectively execute the company s operating strategy and to constantly evolve and refine the critical conceptual elements of j 
alexander s restaurants in order to distinguish them from other casual dining competitors and maintain the company s competitive position 
the restaurant industry is also characterized by high capital investment for new restaurants and relatively high fixed or semi variable restaurant operating expenses 
as a result  incremental sales in existing restaurants are generally expected to make a significant contribution to restaurant profitability because many restaurant costs and expenses do not increase at the same rate as sales 
improvements in profitability resulting from incremental sales growth can be affected  however  by inflationary increases in operating costs and other factors 
management believes that excellence in restaurant operations  and particularly providing exceptional guest service  will increase net sales in the company s existing restaurants and will support menu pricing levels which allow the company to achieve reasonable operating margins while absorbing the higher costs of providing high quality dining experiences and operating cost increases 
incremental sales for existing restaurants are generally measured in the restaurant industry by computing the same store sales increase  which represents the increase in sales for the restaurants included in the same base of restaurants for comparable periods 
same store sales increases can be generated by increases in guest counts and increases in the average check per guest 
the average check per guest can be affected by menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold 
management regularly analyzes guest count and average check trends for each restaurant in order to improve menu pricing and product offering strategies 
management believes that it is important to increase guest counts and average guest checks over time in order to continue to improve the company s profitability 
the company works to balance menu price increases with product offering and margin considerations in its efforts to achieve sustainable long term increases in same store sales 
other key indicators which can be used to evaluate and understand the company s restaurant operations include cost of sales  restaurant labor and related costs and other operating expenses  with a focus on these expenses as a percentage of net sales 
the cost of beef is the largest component of the company s cost of sales 
the company typically enters into an annual pricing agreement which sets the price the company will pay for beef for a month period 
since the company uses primarily fresh ingredients for food preparation  the cost of other food commodities can vary significantly from time to time due to a number of factors 
the company generally expects to increase menu prices in order to offset the increase in the cost of food products as well as increases which the company experiences in labor and related costs and other operating expenses  but attempts to balance these increases with the goals of providing reasonable value to the company s guests and maintaining same store sales growth 
management believes that restaurant operating margin  which is computed by subtracting total restaurant operating expenses from net sales and dividing by net sales  is an important indicator of the company s success in 
table of contents managing its restaurant operations because it is affected by same store sales growth  menu pricing strategy  and the management and control of restaurant operating expenses in relation to net sales 
the opening of new restaurants by the company can have a significant impact on the company s financial performance 
because pre opening costs for new restaurants are significant and most new restaurants incur start up losses during their early months of operation  the number of restaurants opened or under development in a particular year can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
beginning in fiscal  any straight line minimum rent expense incurred during the construction period for any new leased restaurant locations for which construction begins will be included in pre opening expense 
because large capital investments are required for j 
alexander s restaurants and because a significant portion of labor costs and other operating expenses are fixed or semi fixed in nature  management believes the sales required for a j 
alexander s restaurant to break even are relatively high compared to many other casual dining concepts and it is necessary for the company to achieve relatively high sales volumes in its restaurants in order to achieve desired financial returns 
the company s criteria for new restaurant development target locations with high population densities and high household incomes which management believes provide the best prospects for achieving attractive financial returns on the company s investments in new restaurants 
management believes that its intended new restaurant development rate of two to three restaurants per year beginning in should allow the company to acquire new locations which meet the company s development criteria while also allowing management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants and maintain its pursuit of operational excellence 
no new restaurant openings are currently planned in due to the company s fiscal year which ends on the sunday closest to december st of each year  operating results for fiscal and include weeks of operations compared to weeks in the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  i the items in the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales  and ii other selected operating data fiscal year net sales costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor and related costs depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment other operating expenses total restaurant operating expenses general and administrative expenses pre opening expense gain on involuntary property conversion operating income other income expense interest expense  net other  net total other expense income before income taxes income tax provision benefit current deferred total net income note certain percentage totals do not sum due to rounding 
restaurants open at end of year weighted average weekly net sales per restaurant 
table of contents net sales net sales increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to management estimates that net sales for increased by million over net sales for the comparable weeks ended january  this increase was due to increases in net sales in the same store restaurant base and to an additional restaurant which opened in october of net sales increased by million  or  in compared to the sales increase in was due to increases in net sales in the same store restaurant base  additional restaurant operating weeks during because of the opening of three restaurants during  and the additional week included in the fiscal year 
management estimates that the rd week included in the fiscal year increased sales by approximately  compared to management estimates that net sales lost from the effect of hurricanes on the company s operations were approximately  in and  in average weekly same store sales per restaurant increased by to  per week in from  per week in on a base of restaurants 
same store sales averaged  per restaurant per week in  an increase of from on a base of restaurants 
the company computes weighted average weekly sales per restaurant by dividing total restaurant sales for the period by the total number of days all restaurants were open for the period to obtain a daily sales average  with the daily sales average then multiplied by seven to arrive at weekly average sales per restaurant 
days on which restaurants are closed for business for any reason other than the scheduled closure of all j 
alexander s restaurants on thanksgiving day and christmas day are excluded from this calculation 
weighted average weekly same store sales per restaurant are computed in the same manner as described above except that sales and sales days used in the calculation include only those for restaurants open for more than months 
revenue associated with service charges on unused gift cards and reductions in liabilities for gift certificates or cards as discussed below is not included in the calculation of weighted average weekly sales per restaurant or weighted average weekly same store sales per restaurant 
management estimates that weekly average guest counts on a same store basis  and adjusted for hurricane related closure days  decreased by approximately in compared to and increased by approximately 
in compared to management believes that the decrease in guest counts in was due to higher menu prices and  in some locations  to trial by the company s guests of new upscale restaurants in their markets 
the company s failure to operate its restaurants at its expected high standards was also likely a contributing factor in certain locations 
management estimates the average check per guest  including alcoholic beverage sales  increased by to in  from in the average check increased by approximately over the average check 
management estimates that menu prices increased by approximately in over in addition  in april of the company changed its menu pricing format in most locations to modified a la carte pricing for beef and seafood entrees 
under the modified a la carte format  menu prices of beef and seafood entrees which previously included a dinner salad decreased by to in many locations although increasing in certain major market locations  but no longer include a salad 
if desired  a salad can be added for an additional charge of 
menu prices for increased by an estimated compared to no significant increases were made in increased wine sales  which management believes are due to additional emphasis placed on the company s wine feature program  and special menu features also contributed to same store sales increases in and the company recognizes revenue from non use fees related to gift cards and from reductions in liabilities for gift cards and certificates which  although they do not expire  are considered to be only remotely likely to be redeemed 
these revenues are included in net sales in the amounts of   and  for  and  respectively 
the company discontinued service charges on gift cards in and as a result expects gift card revenue to decrease in restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses decreased to of sales in from in  which compared to in the decrease in was primarily the result of lower cost of sales as a percentage of net sales which was partially offset by higher other operating expenses 
the increase in was due primarily to the impact of higher cost of sales and to the effect of higher operating expense percentages experienced in the company s two restaurants opened in the last quarter of  with lower labor costs and depreciation and amortization charges partially offsetting the effect of these increases 
restaurant operating margins increased to in from in  which was down from in 
table of contents cost of sales  which includes the cost of food and beverages  decreased to of net sales in from in due primarily to increases in menu prices and the change in pricing format to modified la carte pricing for beef and seafood entrees  which together with lower prices paid for poultry more than offset higher costs for beef  salmon and other food commodities 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased by in compared to  as the effect of menu price increases did not offset  as a percentage of net sales  significantly higher input costs associated with beef  pork  poultry  dairy products and other food commodities during the year 
beef purchases represent the largest component of the company s cost of sales and comprise approximately to of this category 
due to high prices in the beef market  the company s beef costs have increased significantly over the last two years 
the company typically enters into an annual pricing agreement covering most of its beef purchases 
under the company s beef pricing agreement which was effective in march of  beef prices increased by an estimated to over those under the previous agreement 
a portion of the increase under the march agreement was due to the company upgrading its beef program to serve only certified angus beef in all of its restaurants 
this increase follows an increase of approximately to under the beef pricing agreement which was effective in march of under its most recent pricing agreement effective in march of  the company will continue to serve certified angus beef or other branded high quality choice beef in most locations 
while prices increased by to under the new agreement  management expects to offset a significant portion of the effect of the increases by changing the purchase specifications for one cut of beef in order to increase steak cutting yields and lower the company s effective cost of that product 
in response to escalating beef input costs as well as continuing pressure on the cost of a number of other food items  the company increased menu prices in and the company also changed its pricing format for certain menu items to modified la carte pricing in most locations as discussed above 
the company expects to again raise menu prices in on certain beef offerings as well as other menu items to compensate for higher beef input costs and to maintain or improve profitability 
the company believes the outlook for other food cost items for is relatively stable 
restaurant labor and related costs as a percentage of net sales did not change significantly in compared to and decreased to of net sales in from of net sales during because of the nature of j 
alexander s operations and the company s emphasis on providing high quality food and outstanding levels of service  much of the labor scheduled for overseeing restaurant operations  for preparing food  and for staffing the service areas of the restaurants is relatively fixed in nature within broad ranges of sales for each restaurant 
as a result  increases in net sales in the same store restaurant base in did not result in proportionate increases in labor costs and labor costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 
the effect of these decreases more than offset higher labor costs in newer restaurants 
a decrease in group medical costs resulting from changes to the company s group medical plan also contributed to the decrease 
in  the improved labor efficiency related to the increase in same store sales was more than offset by increases in restaurant management salaries and hourly wage rates  including an increase in labor costs of approximately  resulting from increases in minimum wage rates in two states in which the company operates restaurants 
depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in primarily due to the effect of higher same store sales volumes which more than offset the effect of higher depreciation expense on the new  lower volume locations opened in the fourth quarter of other operating expenses  which include restaurant level expenses such as china and supplies  laundry and linen costs  repairs and maintenance  utilities  credit card fees  rent  property taxes and insurance  increased to of net sales during from of net sales in and of net sales in higher utility costs was the most significant factor contributing to the increase in the company also experienced increases in the cost of insurance  paper supplies and certain other operating expenses 
the increase in compared to was primarily related to increases in rent and other expenses associated with restaurants opened by the company in higher credit card fees  repairs and maintenance expenditures  losses on disposal of restaurant property and equipment and laundry and linen costs also contributed to the increase 
the company expects utility costs to continue to increase significantly in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include all supervisory costs and expenses  management training and relocation costs  and other costs incurred above the restaurant level  increased by  in over and by  in over the increase in included increases due to staff additions  increases in salaries  and higher training and other personnel related expenses  including higher relocation costs and group insurance expense  which were partially offset by the elimination of bonus accruals for the corporate management staff in the most significant factors contributing to the increase in were higher salary expenses  including salaries for additional operations supervisory personnel added in connection with the company s growth  and higher accruals for bonuses to be paid to the corporate staff based on performance 
increases in other personnel related costs as well as higher corporate governance and american stock exchange 
table of contents compliance related expenses also contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in non cash compensation expense recorded in connection with a variable stock option award  which is further discussed below  and a reduction in severance costs compared to when costs were recognized related to the separation from the company of one of its executive officers 
general and administrative expenses included non cash compensation expense of  and  in and  respectively  in connection with a stock option grant accounted for as a variable plan award 
the exercise price of this option grant was fixed by the company s board of directors in may of and  as a result  the company did not recognize any additional compensation expense with respect to this grant after that date and will not recognize any additional compensation expense in the future with respect to this grant 
pre opening expense the company incurred pre opening expense of  in in connection with one new restaurant which was opened 
no restaurants were opened and no pre opening expense was incurred in  whereas three new restaurants were opened and  of pre opening expense was incurred in other income expense net interest expense decreased in compared to due to a reduction in interest expense in resulting from lower borrowings outstanding and an increase in capitalized interest costs 
additionally  investment income  which is netted against interest expense for income statement presentation  increased due to higher balances of invested funds and higher interest rates 
income taxes based on management s assessment of the likelihood of the future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  the beginning of the year valuation allowances for deferred tax assets were reduced by   and  in the fourth quarters of  and  respectively  with corresponding credits to the income tax provisions for those years 
these credits  while reducing income tax expense  are not a current source of cash for the company 
see additional discussion under critical accounting policies income taxes 
during  the company reversed previously accrued federal income taxes payable of  resulting in a reduction in the federal provision 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital needs are primarily for the development and construction of new j 
alexander s restaurants  for maintenance of its existing restaurants  and for meeting debt service and operating lease obligations 
additionally  the company paid a cash dividend to all shareholders aggregating  in january of in order to extend certain contractual standstill restrictions under an agreement with its largest shareholder and may consider paying additional dividends in that regard in the future 
see note o to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has met its needs and maintained liquidity in recent years primarily by cash flow from operations  use of bank lines of credit  and through proceeds received from a mortgage loan in the company s net cash provided by operating activities totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the amount included the receipt of a landlord tenant improvement allowance of approximately  related to a restaurant opened in the fourth quarter of management expects that future cash flows from operating activities will vary primarily as a result of future operating results and is not aware of any material changes in the underlying factors which affect cash flows from operations 
cash and cash equivalents on hand at january  were  the company s capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year depending primarily on the number  timing and form of ownership of new restaurants under development 
cash expenditures for capital assets totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
the company places a high priority on maintaining the image and condition of its restaurants and of the amounts above    and  represented expenditures for remodels  enhancements and asset replacements related to existing restaurants for  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities exceeded capital expenditures in and and represented of capital expenditures for the remaining capital expenditures for were funded primarily by use of a portion of the proceeds from long term mortgage financing completed in october of 
table of contents the company currently does not plan to open any new restaurants in however  management is continually seeking locations for new j 
alexander s restaurants and would consider taking advantage of any attractive opportunities  including conversions of other restaurants  which might arise 
estimated cash expenditures for capital assets for existing restaurants for are approximately million  including approximately  of payments primarily for assets acquired in for the new j 
alexander s restaurant opened in the fourth quarter of that year 
depending on the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites  amounts in addition to those above could be expended in in connection with development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
management believes cash and cash equivalents on hand at january  combined with cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet the company s capital needs for management s longer term growth plan is to open two restaurants in and up to three restaurants per year beginning in while management does not believe these growth plans will be constrained due to lack of capital resources  capital requirements for this level of growth could exceed funds generated by the company s operations 
management believes that  if needed  additional financing would be available for future growth through an increase in bank credit  additional mortgage or equipment financing  or sale and leaseback of some or all of the company s unencumbered restaurant properties 
there can be no assurance  however  that such financing  if needed  could be obtained or that it would be on terms satisfactory to the company 
in october  the company obtained  of long term financing through completion of a mortgage loan transaction 
the mortgage loan has an effective annual interest rate  including the effect of the amortization of deferred issue costs  of and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  over a period of years through november net proceeds from the mortgage loan  after deducting fees and expenses associated with the transaction  were approximately  a portion of these funds was used to pay off the outstanding balance of the company s bank line of credit  terminating that bank facility 
remaining funds were invested in short term money market funds and used along with cash flow from operations primarily for retiring the company s  of convertible subordinated debentures which matured in  to fund capital costs associated with new and existing restaurants  and for repurchases of the company s common stock 
provisions of the mortgage loan and related agreements require that a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to be maintained for the businesses operated at the properties included under the mortgage and that a funded debt to ebitda as defined in the loan agreement ratio of to be maintained for the company and its subsidiaries 
the company was in compliance with all such provisions at both january  and january  the loan is pre payable without penalty after october   with a yield maintenance penalty in effect prior to that time 
the mortgage loan is secured by the real estate  equipment and other personal property of nine of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at january  the real property at these locations is owned by jax real estate  llc  the borrower under the loan agreement  which leases them to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company as lessee 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of the lessee subsidiary to pay rents under the lease 
jax real estate  llc  is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company which is included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  jax real estate  llc was established as a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity and maintains its own legal existence  ownership of its assets and responsibility for its liabilities separate from the company and its other affiliates 
in may of  the company entered into a secured bank line of credit agreement which provides up to  for financing capital expenditures related to the development of new restaurants and for general operating purposes 
credit available under the line is currently approximately million and is based on a percentage of the appraised value of the collateral securing the line 
provisions of the line of credit agreement require that the company maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to and a maximum adjusted debt to ebitdar as defined in the loan agreement ratio of to the company was in compliance with all such provisions at both january  and january  the bank loan agreement also provides that defaults which permit acceleration of debt under other loan agreements constitute a default under the bank agreement 
the company s ability to incur additional debt outside of the line of credit is also restricted 
the line of credit is secured by the real estate of two of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at january  and bears interest on outstanding borrowings at the rate of libor plus a spread of two to four percent  depending on the company s leverage ratio 
the credit line expires on april  management expects that the credit line will be renewed on terms similar to those it currently contains  but there can be no assurance that such a renewal will be successfully completed 
there were no borrowings under the line as of january  to supplement its other sources of capital and provide additional funds for future growth  the company completed  of five year equipment financing with a bank in january the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of its debt agreements as of january  should the company fail to comply with these covenants  management would likely request waivers of the covenants  attempt to renegotiate them or seek other sources of financing 
however  if these efforts were not successful  amounts outstanding under these credit facilities could become immediately due and payable  and there could be a material adverse effect on the 
table of contents company s financial condition and operations 
in  the company received proceeds of approximately  from the involuntary conversion through an eminent domain proceeding of a portion of the property on which one of the company s restaurants is located 
from june through may   the company repurchased approximately  shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately  an average cost of per share 
the company has no current plans to make additional purchases 
while the company at times operates with a working capital deficit  management does not believe such deficits impair the overall financial condition of the company 
many companies in the restaurant industry operate with a working capital deficit because guests pay for their purchases with cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale while trade payables for food and beverage purchases and other obligations related to restaurant operations are not typically due for some time after the sale takes place 
since requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
as of march   the company had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated affiliated entities or related parties 
additionally  the company is not a party to any financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
operating lease commitments for leased restaurants and office space are disclosed in note g  leases and note l  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth significant contractual obligations of the company at january  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capitalized lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total long term debt and capitalized lease obligations include the interest expense component 
excludes renewal option periods 
in determining purchase obligations for this table  the company used its interpretation of the definition set forth in the related rule which states  a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the registrant and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
in applying this definition  the company has only included purchase obligations to the extent the failure to perform would result in formal recourse to j 
alexander s corporation 
from through  the company operated restaurants in the quick service restaurant industry 
the discontinuation of these quick service restaurant operations included disposals of restaurants that were subject to lease agreements which typically contained initial lease terms of years plus two additional option periods of five years each 
in connection with certain of these dispositions  the company remains secondarily liable for ensuring financial performance as set forth in the original lease agreements 
the company can only estimate its contingent liability relative to these leases  as any changes to the contractual arrangements between the current tenant and the landlord subsequent to the assignment are not required to be disclosed to the company 
a summary of the company s estimated contingent liability as of january   is as follows wendy s restaurants leases mrs 
winner s chicken biscuits restaurants leases total contingent liability related to assigned leases there have been no payments by the company of such contingent liabilities in the history of the company 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its accounting for gift card and gift certificate revenue  property and equipment  leases  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those which involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for gift certificates and gift cards the company records a liability for gift certificates and gift cards at the time they are sold by the company s gift card subsidiary 
upon redemption  net sales are recorded and the liability is reduced by the amount of certificates or card values redeemed 
in  the company s gift card subsidiary began selling electronic gift cards which provided for monthly service charges of per month to be deducted from the outstanding balances of the cards after months of inactivity 
these service charges  along with reductions in liabilities for gift cards and certificates which  although they do not expire  are considered to be only remotely likely to be redeemed and for which there is no legal obligation to remit balances under unclaimed property laws of the relevant jurisdictions breakage  have been recorded as revenue by the company and are included in net sales in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the company discontinued the deduction of service charges from gift card balances in based on the company s historical experience  management considers the probability of redemption of a gift card to be remote when it has been outstanding for months 
in  the company recorded breakage of  in connection with the remaining balance of gift certificates issued prior to and  in connection with gift cards that were more than months old 
breakage of  related to gift certificates was recorded during property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  generally including renewal options 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
because significant judgments are required in estimating useful lives  which are not ultimately known until the passage of time and may be dependent on proper asset maintenance  and in the determination of what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair or maintenance expense  changes in circumstances or use of different assumptions could result in materially different results from those determined based on the company s estimates 
lease accounting the company is obligated under various lease agreements for certain restaurant facilities 
for operating leases  the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
capital leases are recorded as an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term or the fair market value of the leased asset 
under the provisions of certain of the company s leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the holidays and escalations have been reflected in capitalized costs or rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that the company will exercise its options for such periods due to the fact that the company would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments 
rent expense incurred during the construction period has been capitalized as a component of property and equipment 
however  any rent expense incurred during the construction period beginning in will be included in pre opening expense 
the leasehold improvements and property held under capital leases for each leased restaurant facility are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the expected lease term used for lease accounting purposes 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is accrued when it is deemed probable that percentage rent will exceed the minimum rent per the lease agreement 
allowances for tenant improvements received from lessors are recorded as adjustments to rent expense over the term of the lease 

table of contents judgments made by the company related to the probable term for each restaurant facility lease affect the payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
impairment of long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets most typically assets associated with a specific restaurant might be impaired  management compares the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted cash flows it expects that restaurant to generate over its remaining useful life 
in calculating its estimate of such undiscounted cash flows  management is required to make assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment  relative to the restaurant s future period of operation  sales performance  cost of sales  labor and operating expenses 
the resulting forecast of undiscounted cash flows represents management s estimate based on both historical results and management s expectation of future operations for that particular restaurant 
to date  all of the company s long lived assets have been determined to be recoverable based on management s estimates of future cash flows 
income taxes the company had  of gross deferred tax assets at january   consisting principally of  of tax credit carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will ultimately be realized 
due to losses incurred by the company from through and because a significant portion of the company s costs are fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude from through that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized  therefore  the company maintained a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  for those years 
in fiscal years through  management continued to assess the likelihood of realization of the company s deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance with respect to those assets 
based on the company s improved historical results and management s forecasts of the company s future taxable income adjusted by varying probability factors  the beginning of the year valuation allowances were reduced by    and  in the fourth quarters of   and  respectively 
in performing its analyses in and  management concluded that a valuation allowance was needed only for federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards of  and for tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards  the use of which involves considerable uncertainty 
the valuation allowance provided for these items at january  was  even though the amt credit carryforwards do not expire  their use is not presently considered more likely than not because significant increases in earnings levels are expected to be necessary to utilize them since they must be used only after certain other carryforwards currently available  as well as additional tax credits which are expected to be generated in future years  are realized 
failure to achieve projected taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of the company s net deferred tax assets 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  there can be no assurance that management s estimates of future taxable income will be achieved and that there could not be a subsequent increase in the valuation allowance 
it is also possible that the company could generate taxable income levels in the future which would cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize all  or an additional portion of  its deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets and upon reaching any different conclusion as to the appropriate carrying value of these assets  management will adjust them to their estimated net realizable value 
any such revisions to the estimated realizable value of the deferred tax assets could cause the company s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefits of the various carryforwards were fully utilized 
however  because the remaining valuation allowance is related to the specific deferred tax assets noted above  management does not anticipate further adjustments to the valuation allowance until the company s projections of future taxable income increase significantly 
in addition  certain other components of the company s provision for income taxes must be estimated 
these include  but are not limited to  effective state tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time the tax provision is prepared 
income tax returns are generally not filed  however  until several months after year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the 
table of contents returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all of the company s accounting policies and estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

in october  the fasb issued staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  and requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
the company has historically capitalized rents paid during the period a restaurant is under construction 
rental costs incurred during the construction period have averaged approximately  per location based upon the company s leased properties placed in service since impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company continually seeks ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs  but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s net sales and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
net sales and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season 
in addition  certain of the company s restaurants  particularly those located in southern florida  typically experience an increase in customer traffic during the period between thanksgiving and easter due to an increase in population in these markets during that portion of the year 
certain of the company s restaurants are located in areas subject to hurricanes and tropical storms  which typically occur during the company s third and fourth quarters  and which can negatively affect the company s net sales and operating results 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
a summary of the company s quarterly results for and appears in this report immediately following the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
while all of the company s debt outstanding as of january  was at fixed rates  the company has historically utilized a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes f and g to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in market interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

table of contents investment portfolio 
the company invests portions of its excess cash  if any  in highly liquid investments 
at january   the company had million in money market accounts 
the market risk on such investments is minimal due to their short term nature 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company routinely has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors  some of which are limited to a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef  seafood and produce vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies would not be material
