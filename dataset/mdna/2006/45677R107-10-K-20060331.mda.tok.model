founded in  inforte is headquartered in chicago and has offices in atlanta  dallas  delhi  india  hamburg  germany  london  los angeles  san francisco and washington  dc our revenue is derived almost entirely through the performance of professional services 
the majority of the services we perform is on a time and materials basis  however  we also perform services on a fixed price basis if this structure best fits out clients preferences or the requirements of the project 
typically  the first portion of an engagement involves a strategy project or a discovery phase lasting to days 
this work enables us to determine with our clients the scope of successive phases of work 
these successive phases of work can be additional strategy phases  or phases for technology design and implementation  and generally last three to nine months 
if a project is to be performed on a fixed price basis  the fixed price is based upon estimates from senior personnel in our consulting organization who project the length of the engagement  the number of people required to complete the engagement and the skill level and billing rates of those people 
we then adjust the fixed price based on various qualitative risk factors such as the aggressiveness of the delivery deadline  the technical complexity of the solution and the value of the solution delivered to the client 
we typically ask clients to pay of our fixed price projects in advance to enable us to secure a project team in a timeframe that is responsive to the client s needs

net revenue is revenue excluding reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this decrease in revenues to a lower demand for our customer relationship management service offering

the revised balances reflect more accurately our exposure to loss from non paying customers  due to the higher number of established relationships with long term clients 
the adjustments in both years were not due to any write off of a specific customer account 
project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this slight decrease is due to lower headcount and lower project personnel total compensation charges 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   up from  in the year ended december  the change in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year is a result of the increase in consultants utilization combined with a rise in the average effective hourly rates of our consultants 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups as well as costs to execute marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease is due to a combination of a cutback in marketing activities  a reduction in sales and marketing headcount and a reduction in incentive bonuses  partially offset by an increase in compensation expense recorded as part of the offer to buy out stock options in march of total costs associated with the buyout of stock options previously granted to sales and marketing personnel were  total sales and marketing headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue dropped in to from in recruiting  retention and training

total management and administrative headcount was  and as of december   and  respectively 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease is due to the lower average cash balance as a result of inforte s one time cash distribution to stockholders as well as of the acquisitions of compendit and gts consulting 
loss on investment in affiliate 
in may inforte entered into a limited liability company agreement of provansis llc an inforte company provansis  by and among inforte  primary knowledge  inc pki  and mr 
ronald meyer 
pursuant to the agreement  inforte  pki and mr

initially  inforte contributed  in cash for a membership interest 
under the terms of the agreement  inforte has one seat on the board of directors  with special voting rights and other privileges  and  therefore  used the equity method of accounting for this investment 
losses in equity of the investee included in inforte s statement of operations were  in income tax expense

years ended december  and revenue before reimbursements net revenue 
net revenue is revenue excluding reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this increase in revenues in part to the acquisition of our new sap practice as well as to an increased demand for our services 
for the year ended december   we had significant clients with each of these clients contributing million to net revenue on average 
we had significant clients during the year ended december   each contributing million to net revenue on average 
we had one significant client contributing more than from net revenue each in and two clients contributed more than from net revenue in project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our professional employees who deliver consulting services and non reimbursable project costs 
all labor costs for project personnel are included in project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from growth in consulting headcount  increased compensation and an increased use of outside contractors 
we employed and consultants on december  and  respectively 
further  project personnel and related expenses were reduced both in and by a downward adjustment of  and  respectively  in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of december   compared to  as of december  the revised balances reflect more accurately our exposure to loss from non paying customers  due to the higher number of established relationships with long term clients 
the adjustments in both years were not due to any write off of a specific customer account 
project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is due to the higher use of subcontractors in in addition to higher project personnel compensation charges 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   down from  in the year ended december  the change in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year is a result of the decrease in consultants utilization combined with a decline in the average effective hourly rates of our consultants 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups as well as costs to execute marketing programs 
sales and marketing and expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this slight increase is due to a combination of intensified marketing activities partially offset by lower headcount related costs in this area  resulting in lower salary  benefit costs and travel expenses 
total sales and marketing headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue dropped in to from in recruiting  retention and training

recruiting  retention and training expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in spending is due primarily to more recruiting costs due to the increase in the number of personnel recruited and the reinstitution of formal training programs 
total employees declined from as of december  to as of december  and then increased to as of december  total recruiting retention and training headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  in addition  as our staffing needs increased  recruiting efforts required spending on recruiting finder fees  signing bonuses  relocation allowances and employee referral bonuses to identify and attract qualified candidates

management and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in for the year ended december   management and administrative expenses increased to as a percent of revenue from in the prior year period  as net revenue grew at a slower rate than management and administrative expenses 
this considerable increase in management and administrative expenses is mainly due to a one time charge of million related to a write off of office space 
in october inforte s executive team authorized a plan to reduce its office space to better align with its space needs 
the total reduction of office space resulting from this consolidation of our office space was approximately  square feet 
excluding this one time charge  total management and administrative expenses increased in compared to the year ended december  and that portion of the increase resulted from higher executive compensation spending in the months of as well as due to increased efforts to build the infrastructure supporting faster revenue growth 
our plan to set up and make fully functional our india location was successfully completed as of the end of the first quarter of in the third quarter of  we reversed  of previously recognized losses as we succeeded in subletting a portion of the abandoned office space  which had been initially regarded as unsuitable for sublease 
total management and administrative headcount was  and as of december   and  respectively 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease was due to the reinvestment of matured securities into similar type securities at lower market interest yields and also due to the lower average cash balance as a result of inforte s acquisition of compendit 
income tax expense 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was of pre tax loss versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in the unusually low effective tax rate in resulted from our reduction of income tax expense by  to account for an estimated reduction of income tax liabilities

excluding the impact of the capital restructuring  cash flow from operating activities was million during financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million  primarily a result of the one time cash distribution of per share of common stock in the second quarter of which was million 
cash inflow from investing activities was million and was due to maturities of short term and long term securities of million offset partially by the cash payments related to the compendit and gts consulting  inc acquisitions of million  investment of million  including million from a note receivable  in provansis llc  a joint venture in which inforte owns and purchases of property and equipment of million 
our collection and credit policies remained unchanged in and none of the activity presented on the statement of cash flows was affected by alterations in our cash management practices 
in january  inforte announced that the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allowed inforte to buy up to million of inforte shares 
the program was completed in august the board of directors approved an additional million stock repurchase program on august  we stated at that time that we had no present plans to make additional repurchases of stock  and as of december   we have made no repurchases under this second program 
as of december   the public float shares not held by executive officers and directors totaled million shares or of total outstanding shares 
on march   by way of a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of inforte with compendit  inforte acquired all of the outstanding shares of compendit  a leading provider of sap business intelligence implementation consulting services  for initial cash consideration of million on closing

the record date for inforte stockholders was set as the close of business on april  and total cash distribution of approximately million was paid to stockholders on april  inforte believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalent balances consist of obligations of us  us  german and indian banks  high grade municipal and us government agencies bonds and other high quality and short term obligations of us companies 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities that are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity

interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
as of december   inforte had a total of up to million in deferred business acquisition cash obligations  of which million was paid in january and million is payable in four equal installment in july   and inforte believes that it will have sufficient funds to satisfy obligations related to the deferred consideration 
we expect to fund these contingent payments  primarily from the cash generated from the operations of the acquired businesses 
in addition to the purchase price obligation for the compendit and gts acquisitions  inforte assumed two operating leases from compendit and one operating lease from gts 
the three assumed operating leases are for renting of office space 
inforte has several operating leases that have contractual cash obligations for future payments 
there are no other contractual obligations that require future cash obligations or other cash commitments

total rent receivable on these sublease contracts is   and  for the years  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than management reasonably could have used have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition  losses on fixed price contracts  deferred revenue 
inforte recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence exists that inforte has an agreement  service has been rendered  its price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
inforte recognizes net revenue from fixed price contracts based on the ratio of hours incurred to total estimated hours 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimated hours to complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
inforte recognizes time and materials net revenue as it performs the services 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issued topic  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred stating these costs should be characterized as revenue in the income statement if billed to customers 
inforte recognizes revenues related to reimbursable expenses as the reimbursable expenses are billed 
inforte only recognizes reimbursable expenses when all of the following three criteria are met persuasive evidence exists that inforte has an agreement that includes the reimbursement of such expenses  the reimbursable expenses have been incurred and billed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for presentation purposes  inforte shows two components of total revenue revenue before reimbursements  which it calls net revenue  consisting of revenue for performing consulting services  and reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements it receives from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
inforte breaks out reimbursements in its presentation of revenue because it believes net revenue  ie  total revenues less reimbursements  is a more meaningful representation of its economic activity than total revenues  since the former excludes zero margin pass through expenses that in its opinion are not pertinent to business fundamentals  financial statement analysis  or the investment decision and  in fact  may mask trends in underlying performance and moreover are not controllable 
financial instruments 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities which are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses 
the amount of the reserve is established analyzing all client accounts to determine credit risk 
in establishing a client s creditworthiness we consider whether the client has a deteriorating or poor financial condition  limited financial resources  poor or no payment history  a large relative accounts receivable balance or a non us location 
stock compensation 
at december   inforte has three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
we account for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas related to options issued to employees 
all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  except for the option grants related to the acquisition of compendit 
in january inforte announced a capital restructuring plan that included an offer to inforte s employees to convert certain outstanding stock options into restricted stock and to exchange certain other stock options for cash 
in the case where eligible employees had elected to cancel their options and receive cash  inforte recognized the related compensation expense at the time when the offer was made  february  on the date of the offer  february   the maximum cash settlement amount was accrued as a liability 
for the options where the cash offer was later accepted  the liability was settled with the cash payment 
the cash offer was not declined for any of the eligible options 
in the alternative case when employees elected to cancel their options and receive restricted stock  the total non cash compensation expense will be expensed ratably over a four year period 
this amount will be expensed over four years because the stock would vest over a four year period  starting in the first quarter of the options in this category were subject to variable accounting treatment from the date of the offer until the offer was accepted 
those options for which the restricted stock offer was declined were immediately vested and continue to be subject to variable accounting treatment thereafter until those options are exercised or cancelled or expire unexercised or until after january  when we adopted sfas r 
variable accounting treatment means that the value of each option will be measured and adjusted each reporting period based on the intrinsic value of the option in the reporting period 
employees with unexercised vested options after the one time distribution with a strike price less than were granted common stock as compensation for the estimated loss in option value due to the one time distribution 
on april  inforte issued  such shares 
on october   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a bonus plan that provides incentives to a small group of senior level officers and employees of inforte 
restricted stock granted under the bonus plan vests based upon the achievement of designated performance targets established by the compensation committee and the lapse of designated vesting periods during which recipients of grants must remain employed on a continuous basis by inforte 
under this bonus plan  as of december   eight individuals have been granted restricted stock totaling  in the aggregate   shares of inforte s common stock 
total expense related to this restricted stock grant is based on the market price at grant date and involved assumptions to project future performance targets and employee tenure 
total estimated cost is then prorated over the employment based vesting period of the grants 
bonus accruals 
we have several bonus programs that are based on individual and company performance 
revenue bonuses are earned based on individual or roll up revenue credit assigned to salespeople  client executives  other senior delivery personnel and senior management 
margin bonuses are earned by all employees based on company or business unit operating income performance 
in addition  senior management may award discretionary bonuses 
all of these bonuses are expensed in the period in which they are earned 
a corresponding accrual is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses until the bonus is paid 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis december for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a valuation methodology based on historical performance and industry specific multiples 
this requires significant judgments and changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
restructuring and other related charges 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  was effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
in october  inforte s executive team authorized a plan to reduce its office space to better align with its space needs 
these steps included consolidating office space at its southern california office and the two chicago locations where inforte had separate contractual rental obligations 
estimated costs for the consolidation of the facilities consist of contractual rental commitments for office space being vacated less estimated sub lease income 
the total reduction of office space resulting from this consolidation of our office space was approximately  square feet at the time the plan was executed 
on july  one of the original lease agreements was amended to reduce total abandoned office space to  square feet 
total charges related to this reduction of space are estimated at million and were recognized at the date the plan for office space consolidation was executed 
if we vacate additional space  if future sub lease income is less than estimated  if we buy out of leases or if we are unable to sublease our vacated space  additional charges or credits in future periods will be necessary 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact the our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance

accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized for share purchase rights granted under the inforte s employee stock option and employee share purchase plans 
after the implementation of the capital restructuring plan  inforte has significantly reduced its exposure to option expensing by reducing options outstanding from million at the end of to million at the end of all options outstanding as of december  were fully vested and there will be no compensation expense related to these options at the time of adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle

sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement
