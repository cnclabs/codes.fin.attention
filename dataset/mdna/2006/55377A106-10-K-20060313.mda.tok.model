risk factors 
overview we provide sophisticated systems engineering  information technology  intelligence and other technical and professional services primarily to us defense  intelligence and civilian federal government agencies 
our services encompass the full system life cycle from requirements definition  design  development and integration to upgrade  sustainment and support for mission critical information and weapons systems 
for the years ended december   and  about  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from our customers in the department of defense and the intelligence community  including the us air force  us army  defense intelligence agency and joint military commands 
having served the department of defense since our founding in  we believe we are well positioned to assist the federal government as it conducts the war on global terrorism and modernizes its defense capabilities 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries we report operating results and financial data as a single segment and believe our contract base is well diversified 
however  a significant amount of our revenue has in recent years been earned under two contracts  the asc bpa and the fast contract 
revenue under the asc bpa was approximately  and  of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the largest task order under the asc bpa amounted to approximately  and  of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the asc bpa  which was awarded as a small business set aside contract  was to expire on september   but has now been extended to august  the replacement contract will also be a small business set aside contract for which we will not qualify to bid as a prime contractor 
while we believe we have a viable strategy to retain the bulk of our work and profitability on the replacement contract by becoming a subcontractor for a number of small businesses bidding on the re compete  our ability to retain work under the replacement contract is uncertain 
some of our work under the asc bpa has been converted to other contract vehicles over the last twelve months 
in july  we were one of six awardees of the fast contract with a ceiling of billion and with a period of performance  including option years  which extends to revenue under the fast contract was approximately  and of total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fast contract revenue for the year ended december  was comprised of over separate task orders  the largest of which amounted to approximately of total revenue for that period 
in prior years  we performed some of the work we are now performing on the fast contract on other contract vehicles 
while the fast contract represents a significant percentage of our total revenue  we believe that the broad array of engineering  technical and management services we provide to the federal government through various contract vehicles allows for diversified business growth 
no other task order  including individual contracts under our gsa vehicles  accounted for more than of revenue for the year ended december  under the fast contract  we have the potential to compete for millions of dollars in task orders over its approximately two and a half year remaining life as the us air force maintains and modernizes aircraft and defense systems 
as of december   we have been awarded over individual task orders under the fast contract with a remaining potential award value of approximately million if all options are exercised 
although we believe the fast contract presents an opportunity for significant additional growth and expansion of our services  we expect that many of the task orders we may be awarded under the fast contract will be for lead system integrator and program management services  which historically have been less profitable than our other activities  because these activities typically involve a significantly greater use of subcontractors 
margins on subcontractor based revenue are typically lower than the margins on our direct work 
since the fast contract is expected to be a significant part of our business for the next several years  it is possible that our operating income  as a percentage of total revenue  could diminish  while growing in absolute dollars 
our federal government contracts  which comprised over of our revenue in  are subject to government audits of our direct and indirect costs 
the incurred cost audits have been completed through december  and the rates have been agreed to 
we do not anticipate any material adjustment to our financial statements in subsequent periods for audits not yet completed 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue came from work provided to our customers as a prime contractor and the balance came from work provided as a subcontractor 
approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of the work of our employees  and the balance was provided by the work of subcontractors 
our work as a prime contractor on the fast contract has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a significant use of subcontractors 
the increased use of subcontractors on the fast contract has been partially offset by the business model of our recent acquisitions  which typically have not used subcontractors to a great extent 

table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries we typically provide our services under contracts with a base term  often of three years  and option terms  typically two to four additional terms of one year or more  which the customer can exercise on an annual basis 
we also have contracts with fixed terms  some extending as long as five or six years 
although we occasionally obtain government contracts for which the contracting agency obligates funding for the full term of the contract  most of our government contracts receive incremental funding  which subjects us to the risks associated with the government s annual appropriations process 
contract types when contracting with our government customers  we enter into one of three basic types of contracts time and materials  fixed price and cost plus 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we receive a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour worked  plus reimbursement for our allowable direct costs 
to the extent that our actual labor costs vary significantly from the negotiated rates under a time and materials contract  we can either make more money than we originally anticipated or lose money on the contract 
fixed price contracts 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform specified work for a firm  fixed price 
if our actual costs exceed our estimate of the costs to perform the contract  we may generate less profit or incur a loss 
a significant portion of our fixed price contract work is under a fixed price level of effort contract  which represents a similar level of risk to our time and materials contracts  under which we agree to perform certain units of work for a fixed price per unit 
we generally do not undertake high risk work  such as software development  under fixed price contracts 
cost plus contracts 
under cost plus contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and receive a supplemental fee  which represents our profit 
cost plus fixed fee contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of anticipated costs 
cost plus incentive fee and cost plus award fee contracts provide for increases or decreases in the contract fee  within specified limits  based upon actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost  quality  schedule and performance 
the following table provides information about the percentage of revenue attributable to each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated years ended december  time and materials fixed price cost plus total critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
our critical accounting policies primarily concern revenue recognition and related cost estimation 
we recognize revenue under our government contracts when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred and collection of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under time and materials  fixed price and cost plus contracts 
we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered  plus expenses incurred 
for fixed price contracts within the scope of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method using costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs or 
table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries upon delivery of specific products or services  as appropriate 
for fixed price completion contracts that are not within the scope of sop  revenue is generally recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided 
we will provide our customer with a number of different services that are generally documented through separate negotiated task orders that detail the services to be provided and our compensation for these services 
services rendered under each task order represent an independent earnings process and are not dependent on any other service or product sold 
we recognize revenue on cost plus contracts to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned  which may be fixed or performance based 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract  which generally corresponds to the timing of contractual billings 
we record provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which we identify those losses 
we consider performance based fees  including award fees  under any contract type to be earned only when we can demonstrate satisfaction of a specific performance goal or we receive contractual notification from a customer that the fee has been earned 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
from time to time  facts develop that require us to revise the total estimated costs or revenues expected 
in most cases  these changes relate to changes in the contractual scope of the work and do not significantly impact the expected profit rate on a contract 
we record the cumulative effects of any revisions to the estimated total costs and revenues in the period in which the facts become known 
our work in process inventory relates to costs accumulated under fixed price type contracts accounted for under the completed contract method and certain output measures  such as units delivered  of the percentage of completion method 
the work in process inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is computed on an average cost basis 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired companies 
purchase price allocated to intangible assets is amortized using the straight line method over the estimated terms of the contracts  which range from three to eight years 
we perform impairment reviews on an annual basis 
we have elected to conduct our annual impairment reviews as of the fourth quarter of each year 
we base our assessment of possible impairment on the discounted present value of the operating cash flows of our consolidated operating unit 
we determined that no impairment charges were required in  and income taxes 
we calculate our income tax provision using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates would be recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
results of operations our results of operations may not be directly comparable on a year to year basis due to acquisitions we made throughout the three years ended december  we acquired obsi in january  mti in february  cti in july  and vitronics and ici in october as part of our overall strategy to expand our customer reach and technical capabilities  we expect to continue to strategically acquire complementary businesses in the future

our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million on december  and  respectively 
our working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
our working capital decreased million in primarily as a result of the following fluctuations a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase in accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of amounts billed resulting from the significant increase in revenue in as well as the acquisitions of obsi and mti in the first quarter of  a million increase in inventory  and a million increase in current liabilities primarily resulting from a million increase in accounts payable from non labor costs  such as subcontract costs and direct materials  resulting from the increased revenue in and million in current maturities of long term debt

our financing activities provided net cash of approximately million for the year ended december   which consisted of net borrowings under the term loan portion of our credit facility of million and million from common stock issuances related to the exercise of stock options 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from the net proceeds from the public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in february  as well as the effect of common stock issuances related to stock option transactions 
in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
our net proceeds from the sale of the shares  after the underwriting discount and other expenses  were million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering together with cash on hand and additional borrowings for working capital and general corporate purposes  as well as for the acquisition of complementary businesses 
in january  we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of obsi from its sole shareholder 
the initial purchase price was million paid from cash on hand at closing 
in addition  obsi s shareholder may receive additional cash payments through if certain operating goals are achieved 
it is anticipated that we will realize income tax benefits with a net present value of approximately million in future periods as the results of the obsi shareholder agreeing to a section h election under the internal revenue code of in february  we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of mti 
the initial purchase price was million paid in cash at closing  of which approximately million was from available cash on hand and million of which was borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
it is also anticipated that we will realize income tax benefits with a net present value of approximately million in future periods as the result of the mti shareholders agreeing to a section h election under the internal revenue code of during  we had a million revolving credit facility that could be increased to million subject to meeting certain requirements and obtaining our lenders approval 
the credit agreement governing this revolving credit facility was initially scheduled to expire on december   however  in july  we amended the agreement to extend the term to december  in december  we amended the credit agreement with the same four banks  increasing the borrowing availability to million  as well as modifying certain financial covenants 
in april  we entered into a five year credit and security agreement  dated as of april  the credit agreement  with national city bank  branch banking and trust company  keybank national association  fifth third bank  jpmorgan chase bank  na  comerica bank and pnc bank  na the credit 
table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries agreement  which is scheduled to expire on march   allows us to borrow up to million in the form of an million revolving loan and a million term loan 
the interest rates on borrowings under the term loan range from the prime rate to the prime rate plus basis points  or the london interbank offered rate libor rate plus to basis points  and under the revolving loan are the prime rate  or the libor rate plus to basis points  depending in most instances on the ratio of our consolidated funded debt to consolidated pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the borrowing availability at december  under the revolving loan portion of the credit agreement was million 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the term loan portion of the facility of the credit agreement 
we had no debt outstanding in borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a general lien on our consolidated assets 
in addition  we are subject to certain restrictions  and we are required to meet certain financial covenants 
these covenants require that we  among other things  maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with national city bank under which we will exchange floating rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments 
the agreement covers a combined notional amount of debt initially equal to million  and the agreement ends march  the amount of the swap is of the outstanding balance of our term loan and is reduced as the loan amortizes 
the swap provides for payments over approximately a four year period beginning in december  and is settled on a quarterly basis 
the fixed interest rate provided by the agreement is plus our spread  which is currently basis points 
part of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses 
we have made acquisitions in the past  and intend to make acquisitions in the future 
historically  we have financed our acquisitions with the proceeds from our public stock offerings  cash on hand  borrowings under credit facilities and shares of our common stock 
we expect to finance any future acquisitions with proceeds from cash generated by operations  additional sales or issuances of shares of our common stock  borrowings under our credit agreement or a combination of the foregoing 
management believes that the cash generated by operations and amounts available under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  debt service obligations  purchase price commitments for completed acquisitions and capital expenditures for the next twelve months and through march  when our credit agreement matures 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities spes or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spes or vies

and subsidiaries contractual obligations 
following is information regarding our long term contractual obligations outstanding at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r is effective for all stock based awards granted on or after january  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards which will approximate the value previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we adopted this standard as of january  using the modified prospective method as defined in sfas no 
r 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will result in a reduction of net earnings of million  or per share for the year ended december  this estimate is based on many assumptions including the level of stock option grants expected in  our stock price  and significant assumptions in the option valuation model including volatility and the expected life of options 
actual expenses could differ from the estimate 
quarterly results of operations our results of operations  particularly our revenue  gross profit and cash flow  may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contract performance  revenue earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of customer orders or deliveries  changes in the scope of contracts and billing of other direct and subcontract costs  timing of funding of task orders  the commencement and completion of contracts we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity  as well as in the number of contracts or task orders commenced or completed during any quarter  may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september if a federal budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date in each year  our customers may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
any suspensions may cause us to realize lower revenue in the fourth quarter of the year  and possibly ensuing quarters of the following year 
in addition  a change in presidential administration  congressional majority or in other senior federal government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases technology and engineering services 
the federal government s fiscal year end can also trigger increased purchase requests from customers for equipment and materials 
any 
table of contents mtc technologies  inc 
and subsidiaries increased purchase requests we receive as a result of the federal government s fiscal year end would serve to increase our fourth quarter revenues  but will generally decrease profit margins for that quarter  as these activities typically are not as profitable as our normal service offerings 
further  some of our subcontractors have calendar year ends and sometimes submit large billings at the end of the calendar year that can cause a spike in our revenue and expenses related to subcontracts 
this will also generally decrease our profit margins as revenues generated by billings from subcontractors generally have much lower margins than our revenues generated by direct work 
as a result of the above factors  period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful 
potential investors should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance as no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our then existing credit facility 
as discussed above under management s discussion and analysis regarding financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  we entered into the credit agreement on april  and had million outstanding under such agreement as of december  we have offset a portion of our interest rate risk by entering into an interest rate swap agreement with national city bank in october  under which we will exchange floating rate interest payments for fixed rate interest payments 
the agreement covers a combined notional amount of debt initially of million  and the agreement ends march  the amount of the swap is of the outstanding balance our term loan and is reduced as the loan amortizes 
the swap provides for payments over approximately a four year period beginning in december  and is settled on a quarterly basis 
the fixed interest rate provided by the agreement is plus our spread  which is currently basis points 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates during would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately  for the year ended december
