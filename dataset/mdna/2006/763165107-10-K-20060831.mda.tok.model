in addition  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of approximately million relating to deferred tax assets from certain foreign subsidiaries 
in fiscal  the company re evaluated the realization of certain deferred tax assets  resulting in an additional valuation allowance of million

the reversal of the million deferred tax liability in fiscal resulted in an additional valuation allowance in the same amount and  therefore  did not effect the fiscal tax provision 
cumulative positive earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries were still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to apb no 
and amounted to million at june  due to various tax attributes that are continually changing  it is not possible to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated

the company did not receive a tax benefit from the current eti exclusion in fiscal when this benefit is fully phased out  it will have no impact on the rate 
another provision of the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding the company s financial position and results of operations 
their application involves more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the estimates are influenced by the following considerations continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of net sales 
material changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments to the allowance affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
at june   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million as compared to million at may  impairment of investments the company holds a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assesses its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  the judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary

if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded

inventories the company carries all its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor  and overhead associated with such inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods held for sale

if future demands  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
the company recorded inventory obsolescence and overstock provisions of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  which was included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  the company implemented new policies and procedures to strengthen its inventory management process while continuing to invest in system technology to further enhance its inventory management tools 
these policy and procedure changes included increased approval authorization levels for inventory purchases  quarterly quantitative and qualitative inventory aging analysis and review  changes in the budgeting process to establish targets and metrics that relate to its return on assets rather than only a revenue and profit expectation  and realignment of incentive programs in accordance with these targets and metrics 
the company is committed to inventory management as an ongoing process as the business evolves and technology changes 
long lived and intangible assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
the company assesses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is written down and impairment loss is recorded in operating results 
in assessing the potential impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  management makes significant estimates and assumptions regarding the discounted future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets on an annual basis 
these estimates and their related assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected future operating results  industry and economy trends  market discount rates  indirect expense allocations  and tax rates 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy  company profitability  or market conditions  among other factors  this could adversely affect future goodwill and other intangible assets valuations and result in impairment charges 
effective june   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived assets from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
the company performs its impairment test as of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the company did not find any indication that an impairment existed and  therefore  no impairment loss was recorded in fiscal warranties the company offers warranties for specific products it manufactures 
the company also provides extended warranties for some products it sells that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
terms generally range from one to three years 
the company estimates the cost to perform under its warranty obligation and recognizes this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
the company reports this expense as an element of cost of sales in its consolidated statement of operations 
each quarter  the company assesses actual warranty costs incurred  on a product by product basis  as compared to its estimated obligation 
the estimates with respect to new products are based generally on knowledge of the products and are extrapolated to reflect the extended warranty period  and are refined each quarter as better information with respect to warranty experience becomes known 
warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  
table of contents including both positive and negative evidence  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
those factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where the company or any of its affiliates has incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed by the company at a minimum to overcome that negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards 
in evaluating the positive evidence available  expectations as to future taxable income would rarely be sufficient to overcome the negative evidence of recent cumulative losses  even if supported by detailed forecasts and projections 
in order to reverse the recorded valuation allowance  the company would likely need to have positive cumulative earnings for the three year period preceding the year of the reversal 
therefore  the company s projections as to future earnings would not be used as an indicator in analyzing whether a valuation allowance established in a prior year can be removed or reduced 
at june  and may   the company s deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards were million and million  respectively 
the tax carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credit carryovers 
a majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried forward for years 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for the majority of its federal deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards  and for tax loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries 
the company believes that the deferred tax assets for the remaining tax carryforwards are considered more likely than not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services

this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no

 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments the company s foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and intercompany receivables and payables  primarily in canada  member countries of the european union  asia pacific and  to a lesser extent  latin america 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures and has entered into forward contracts to hedge significant transactions  however  this activity is 
table of contents infrequent 
the company did not enter into any forward contracts in fiscal or other tools that may be used to manage foreign exchange exposures include the use of currency clauses in sales contracts and the use of local debt to offset asset exposures 
as discussed above  the company s debt financing  in part  varies with market rates exposing the company to the market risk from changes in interest rates 
certain operations  assets  and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency exchange risk 
in order to provide the user of these financial statements guidance regarding the magnitude of these risks  the securities and exchange commission requires the company to provide certain quantitative disclosures based upon hypothetical assumptions 
specifically  these disclosures require the calculation of the effect of a increase in market interest rates and a uniform strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies on the reported net earnings and financial position of the company 
under these assumptions  additional interest expense  tax effected  would have increased the net loss by million in both fiscal and fiscal these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate increase on the company s variable rate outstanding borrowings 
had the us dollar strengthened against various foreign currencies  sales would have been lower by an estimated million in fiscal and million in fiscal total assets would have declined by an estimated million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect the company s operations
