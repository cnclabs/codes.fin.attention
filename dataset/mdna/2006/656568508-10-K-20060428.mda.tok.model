business overview our business nortel is a global supplier of communication equipment serving both service provider and enterprise customers 
we deliver products and solutions that help simplify networks  improve productivity as well as drive value creation and efficiency for consumers 
our next generation technologies span access and core networks  support multimedia and business critical applications  and help eliminate today s barriers to efficiency  speed and performance by simplifying networks and connecting people with information 
our networking solutions consist of hardware  software and services 
our business activities include the design  development  assembly  marketing  sale  licensing  installation  servicing and support of these networking solutions 
as a substantial portion of our business has a technology focus  we are dedicated to making strategic investments in research and development  or r d 
we believe one of our core strengths is strong customer loyalty from providing value to our customers through high reliability networks  a commitment to ongoing support  and evolving solutions to address product technology trends 
our segments during  our operations were organized into four reportable segments as follows carrier packet networks provides i circuit and packet voice solutions  ii data networking and security solutions and iii optical networking solutions 
together  these solutions provide data  voice and multimedia communications solutions to our service provider customers that operate wireline networks 
these service provider customers include local and long distance telephone companies  wireless service providers  cable operators and other communication service providers 
cdma networks provides communication network solutions to our wireless service provider customers based on code division multiple access  or cdma  and time division multiple access  or tdma  technologies to enable those service providers to offer their customers  the subscribers for wireless communication services  the ability to be mobile while they send and receive voice and data communications using wireless devices  such as cellular telephones  personal digital assistants and other computing and communications devices 
gsm and umts networks also provides communication network solutions to our wireless service provider customers  however  these solutions are based on global system for mobile communications  or gsm  and universal mobile telecommunications system  or umts  technologies 
enterprise networks provides i circuit and packet voice solutions and ii data networking and security solutions which provide data  voice and multimedia communications solutions to our enterprise customers 
our enterprise networks customers consist of a broad range of enterprise customers around the world  including large businesses and their branch offices  small businesses and home offices  as well as government agencies  educational and other institutions and utility organizations 
on september   we announced a new organizational structure that we expect will strengthen our enterprise focus  drive product efficiencies  and enhance our delivery of global services 
the new alignment includes two product groups i enterprise solutions and packet networks  which combines optical networking solutions included in our carrier packet networks segment in  data networking and security solutions and portions of circuit and packet voice solutions included in both our carrier packet networks segment and enterprise networks segment in into a unified product group  and ii mobility and converged core networks  which combines our cdma solutions and gsm and umts solutions each a separate segment in and other circuit and packet voice solutions included in our carrier packet networks segment in 
by creating two product groups  we expect to simplify our business model and create new cost efficiencies by leveraging common hardware and software platforms 
we expect these two product groups to form our reportable segments commencing in the first quarter of we are also in the process of establishing an operating segment that focuses on providing professional services in five key areas integration services  security services  managed services  optimization services  and maintenance services  which are currently a component of all of our networking solutions 
we expect this operating segment to become a third reportable segment in the second half of how we measure performance our president and chief executive officer  or ceo  has been identified as our chief operating decision maker  or codm  in assessing the performance and allocating resources to our operating segments 
the primary financial measure used by the codm is management earnings loss before income taxes  or management ebt 
this measure includes the cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense  r d expense  interest expense  other income expense net  minority interests net of tax and equity in net earnings loss of associated companies net of tax 
interest attributable to long term debt is not allocated to a reportable segment and is included in other 
the codm does not review asset information on a segmented basis in order to assess performance and allocate resources 
see segment information general description in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  we monitor performance in the following areas status with our key customers on a global basis  the achievement of expected milestones of our key r d projects  and the achievement of our key strategic initiatives 
in an effort to ensure we are creating value for our customers and maintaining strong relationships with those customers  we monitor our project implementation  customer service levels and the status of key customer contracts 
we also conduct regular customer satisfaction and loyalty surveys to monitor customer relationships 
with respect to our r d projects  we measure content  quality and timeliness versus project plans 
our business environment with the growth of data  voice and multimedia communications over the public telephone network  the public internet and private voice and data communications networks  disparate networks are migrating to converged high performance packet networks that can support most types of communications traffic and applications 
converged voice and data networks incorporating packet based technologies provide an opportunity for service providers to offer new revenue generating services while reducing annual operating costs and an opportunity for enterprises to become more cost effective and productive 
we believe our key advantage lies in our ability to transition and upgrade our enterprise and service provider customers voice and data networks to a multimedia enabled internet protocol  or ip  networks with carrier grade reliability 
the demand for voice over ip  or voip  and broadband access to ip based networks and third generation  or g  wireless networks were a source of industry growth in  and we expect spending in these areas will continue to expand the market for services and solutions provided by communications equipment vendors 
we anticipate this demand to lead to further investment in network infrastructure  including optical technologies  and application convergence 
regulatory developments  including the anticipated grant of new national licenses for g wireless services in china  are also expected to have a positive impact on industry demand for next generation wireless services 
at the same time  the market for traditional voice and second generation wireless technologies is expected to continue to decline 
these significant technology shifts have resulted in service providers and enterprises limiting their investment in mature technologies as they focus on maximizing return on invested capital  requiring communications equipment vendors to leverage their installed base in legacy markets 
furthermore  pricing pressures continue to increase as a result of global competition  particularly from suppliers situated in emerging markets with low cost structures like china 
consolidation among customers  leading to fewer and larger customers  many of whom are focusing on improving the efficiency of their combined networks rather than network expansion  is also increasing pricing pressure 
in addition  significant consolidation among communications equipment vendors is commencing and is expected to continue 
while we have seen encouraging indicators in certain parts of the market  we can provide no assurance the growth areas that have begun to emerge will continue in the future 
see the risk factors section of this report for factors that may negatively impact our results 
our strategy we continue to drive our business forward with a renewed focus on execution and operational excellence through i the transformation of our businesses and processes  ii integrity renewal and iii growth imperatives 
our plan for business transformation is expected to address our biggest operational challenges and is focused on simplifying our organizational structure  reflecting the alignment of carrier and enterprise networks  and maintains a strong focus on revenue generation as well as quality improvements and cost reduction through a program known as six sigma 
this program contemplates the transformation of our business in six key areas services  procurement effectiveness  revenue stimulation including sales and pricing  r d effectiveness  general and administrative effectiveness  and organizational and workforce effectiveness 
employees throughout our organization are engaged in supporting various objectives in each of these areas 
we remain focused on integrity renewal through a commitment to effective corporate governance practices  remediation of our material weaknesses in our internal controls and ethical conduct 
we have enhanced our compliance function to increase compliance with applicable laws  regulations and company policies and to increase employee awareness of our code of ethical business conduct 
our growth imperatives are motivated by a desire to increase profitable growth and focus on areas where we can attain a leadership position and a minimum market share of twenty percent in key technologies 
some areas in which we plan to increase our investment include products compliant with the worldwide interoperability for microwave access  or wimax  standard  the ip multimedia subsystem  or ims  architecture  and iptv 
as part of this strategy  we have decided to redirect funding from our services edge router business and to sell certain assets of our blade server switch business unit 
we have developed our strategy with a view to maximizing the effectiveness of our strategic alliances and capturing the benefits of growing technology convergence in the marketplace 
we believe our strategy will position us to respond to evolving technology and industry trends and enable us to provide end to end solutions that are developed internally and through our strategic alliances 
we expect to continue to play an active role in influencing emerging broadband and wireless standards 
furthermore  we believe cooperation of multiple vendors is critical to the success of our communications solutions for both service providers and enterprises 
recent key strategic and business initiatives include our finance transformation project  which will implement  among other things  a new information technology platform sap to provide an integrated global financial system  growing our business with us government clients through pec solutions  inc now nortel government solutions  incorporated  or pec  which we acquired in june  establishing a greater presence in asia pacific through our recently established joint venture with lg electronics  inc  or lg  our proposed joint venture with huawei technologies co  ltd  or huawei  to develop ultra broadband access solutions  strengthening our end to end convergence solutions and focus on the enterprise market  including the acquisition of tasman networks inc  or tasman networks  and evolving our supply chain strategy

proposed class action settlement on february   we announced that  as a result of the previously announced mediation process we entered into with the lead plaintiffs in two significant class action lawsuits pending in the us district court for the southern district of new york and based on the recommendation of a senior federal judge  we and the lead plaintiffs have reached an agreement in principle to settle these lawsuits  or the proposed class action settlement 
this settlement would be part of  and is conditioned on  our reaching a global settlement encompassing all pending shareholder class actions and proposed shareholder class actions commenced against us and certain other defendants following our announcement of revised financial guidance during and our revision of certain of our financial results and restatement of other prior periods 
the proposed class action settlement is also conditioned upon the receipt of all required court  securities regulatory and stock exchange approvals 
on march   we announced that we and the lead plaintiffs reached an agreement on the related insurance and corporate governance matters including our insurers agreeing to pay in cash towards the settlement and us agreeing with our insurers to certain indemnification obligations 
on april   the insurance proceeds were placed into escrow by the insurers 
we believe that these indemnification obligations would be unlikely to materially increase our total cash payment obligations under the proposed class action settlement 
the insurance payments would not reduce the amounts payable by us as noted below 
we also agreed to certain corporate governance enhancements  including the codification or certain of our current governance practices such as the annual election by our directors of a non executive board chair in our board of directors written mandate and the inclusion in our annual proxy circular and proxy statement of a report on certain of our other governance practices such as the process followed for the annual evaluation of the board  committees of the board and individual directors 
the proposed class action settlement would contain no admission of wrongdoing by us or any of the other defendants 
under the terms of the proposed global settlement contemplated by the proposed class action settlement  we would make a payment of in cash  issue  of nortel networks corporation common shares representing of our equity as of february   and contribute one half of any recovery in our existing litigation against our former president and chief executive officer  former chief financial officer and former controller  who were terminated for cause in april  seeking the return of payments made to them under our bonus plan in in the event of a share consolidation of nortel networks corporation common shares  the number of nortel networks corporation common shares to be issued pursuant to the proposed class action settlement would be adjusted accordingly 
as a result of the proposed class action settlement  we have established a litigation provision and recorded a charge to our full year financial results of  of which relates to the proposed cash portion of the proposed class action settlement  while  relates to the proposed equity component and will be adjusted in future quarters based on the fair value of the nortel networks corporation common shares issuable until the finalization of the settlement 
the cash amount bears interest commencing march  at a prescribed rate and is to be held in escrow on june  pending satisfactory completion of all conditions to the proposed class action settlement 
any change to the terms of the proposed class action settlement as a result of ongoing discussions with the lead plaintiffs would likely also result in an adjustment to the litigation provision 
discussions are ongoing regarding a process to resolve the canadian actions as part of the terms of the proposed class action settlement and we and the lead plaintiffs are continuing discussions towards a definitive settlement agreement 
at this time  it is not certain that such an agreement can be reached  that each of the actions noted above can be brought into  or otherwise bound by  the proposed settlement  if finalized  or that such an agreement would receive the required court and other approvals in all applicable jurisdictions 
the timing of any developments related to these matters is also not certain 
the proposed class action settlement and the litigation provision charge taken in connection with the proposed class action settlement do not relate to ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations and do not encompass a related employment retirement income security act  or erisa  class action or the pending application in canada for leave to commence a derivative action against certain of our current and former officers and directors

restatements  nortel audit committee independent review  material weaknesses  related matters first and second restatements and independent review we have effected successive restatements of prior period financial results 
following the restatement effected in december of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and for the quarters ended march  and june   or the first restatement  the audit committees of nnc s and nnl s board of directors  or the audit committee  initiated an independent review of the facts and circumstances leading to the first restatement  or the independent review  and engaged wilmer cutler pickering hale dorr llp  or wilmerhale  to advise it in connection with the independent review 
this review and related work led to a variety of actions  including the termination for cause of nnc s and nnl s former ceo  chief financial officer and controller in april and seven additional individuals with significant responsibilities for financial reporting in august  and ultimately to the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended december  and and the quarters ended march  and  june  and and september  and  or the second restatement 
for more information about the first and second restatement  see our annual report on form k  or the annual report in january  the audit committee reported the findings of the independent review  together with its recommendations for governing principles for remedial measures  the summary of which is included in the controls and procedures section of the annual report 
each of our and nnl s board of directors adopted these recommendations in their entirety and directed our management to implement those principles  through a series of remedial measures  across the company  to prevent any repetition of past misconduct and re establish a finance organization with values of transparency  integrity  and sound financial reporting as its cornerstone 
management s ongoing implementation efforts are described below and will continue following the filing of this report 
the board of directors has monitored the implementation efforts to date and will continue to regularly monitor management s implementation efforts 
see the controls and procedures section of this report 
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting over the course of the second restatement process  we identified a number of reportable conditions  each constituting a material weakness  in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  five of those material weaknesses continued to exist as of december  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  and the related sec rules  management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   using the criteria issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  or coso  in internal control integrated framework 
based on that assessment  management determined that those previously identified five material weaknesses continued to exist as of december  and therefore concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting based on the coso criteria 
deloitte issued an attestation report with respect to that assessment and conclusion  which is included in item a of this report  and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   which remain unremedied  are lack of compliance with written nortel procedures for monitoring and adjusting balances related to certain accruals and provisions  including restructuring charges and contract and customer accruals  lack of compliance with nortel procedures for appropriately applying applicable gaap to the initial recording of certain liabilities including those described in statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies  or sfas no 
 and to foreign currency translation as described in sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  or sfas no 
 lack of sufficient personnel with appropriate knowledge  experience and training in us gaap and lack of sufficient analysis and documentation of the application of us gaap to transactions  including but not limited to revenue transactions  lack of a clear organization and accountability structure within the accounting function  including insufficient review and supervision  combined with financial reporting systems that are not integrated and which require extensive manual interventions  and lack of sufficient awareness of  and timely and appropriate remediation of  internal control issues by nortel personnel 
as used above  the term material weakness means a significant deficiency within the meaning of public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no 
 or a combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
we continue to identify  develop and implement remedial measures to address these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
for more information see the controls and procedures section of this report and risks related to our restatements and related matters in the risk factors section of this report 
third restatement over the course of the second restatement process  nortel  together with its external independent registered chartered accountants  identified a number of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as at december  five of those material weaknesses continued to exist as at december  and in addition  in january  our and nnl s boards of directors adopted in their entirety the governing principles for remedial measures identified through the independent review 
we continue to develop and implement these remedial measures 
as part of these remedial measures and to compensate for the unremedied material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we undertook intensive efforts in to enhance our controls and procedures relating to the recognition of revenue 
these efforts included  among other measures  extensive documentation and review of customer contracts for revenue recognized in and earlier periods 
as a result of the contract review  it became apparent that certain of the contracts had not been accounted for properly under us gaap 
most of these errors related to contractual arrangements involving multiple deliverables  for which revenue recognized in prior periods should have been deferred to later periods  under american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  software revenue recognition  and sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  revenue recognition  or sab in addition  based on our review of our revenue recognition policies and discussions with our independent registered chartered accountants as part of the audit  we determined that in our previous application of these policies  we misinterpreted certain of these policies principally related to complex contractual arrangements with customers where multiple deliverables were accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting under sop  as described in more detail below certain complex arrangements with multiple deliverables were previously fully accounted for under the percentage of completion method of sop  but elements outside of the scope of sop should have been examined for separation under the guidance in eitf  and certain complex arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method did not meet the criteria for this treatment in sop and should instead have been accounted for using completed contract accounting under sop in correcting for both application errors  the timing of revenue recognition was frequently determined to be incorrect  with revenue having generally been recognized prematurely when it should have been deferred and recognized in later periods 
management s determination that these errors required correction led to the audit committee s decision on march  to effect a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements the third restatement 
we have restated our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and consolidated statements of operations  changes in equity and comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the years ended december  and the third restatement also corrected other miscellaneous accounting errors  as well as the classification of certain items within the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  as described below 
the impact of the third restatement to periods prior to was a net increase of to opening accumulated deficit as of january  the following tables present the impact of the third restatement on our previously reported consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended december  and consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended december  revenue and as previously cost of revenue other reported adjustments adjustments as restated revenues gross profit operating earnings loss earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interests and equity in net loss of associated companies net earnings loss from continuing operations net earnings loss from discontinued operations net of tax net earnings loss basic and diluted earnings loss per common share from continuing operations from discontinued operations basic and diluted earnings loss per common share consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended december  revenue and as previously cost of revenue other reported adjustments adjustments as restated revenues gross profit operating earnings loss earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes  minority interests and equity in net loss of associated companies net earnings loss from continuing operations net earnings loss from discontinued operations net of tax net earnings loss basic and diluted earnings loss per common share from continuing operations from discontinued operations basic and diluted earnings loss per common share revenues and cost of revenues adjustments the third restatement adjustments that related to revenue recognition errors resulted in a net decrease to revenues of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these errors related to revenue previously recognized that should have been deferred to subsequent periods 
corresponding adjustments to cost of revenues were made  resulting in a net decrease to cost of revenues of and related to the revenue recognition adjustments  and a total net decrease of and including other adjustments  for the years ended december  and respectively 
revenues cost of revenues as previously reported adjustments application of sop interaction between multiple revenue recognition accounting standards application of sab and sop other revenue recognition adjustments other adjustments a as restated a for further details see explanations of other adjustments 
application of sop we determined that in certain arrangements we had misinterpreted the guidance in sop relating to the application of percentage of completion accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are generally recorded based on a measure of the percentage of costs incurred to date relative to the total expected costs of the contract 
in certain circumstances where a reasonable estimate of costs cannot be made  but it is assured that no loss will be incurred  revenue is recognized to the extent of direct costs incurred zero margin accounting 
if a reasonable estimate of costs cannot be made and we are not assured that no loss will be incurred  revenue should be recognized using completed contract accounting 
for certain arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method which included rights to future software upgrades  we have now determined that we did not have a sufficient basis to estimate the total costs of the arrangements  due to the inability to estimate the cost of providing these future software upgrades 
in addition  in one arrangement  we had previously applied zero margin accounting on the basis that we believed that no loss would be incurred 
we have now determined that assurance that no loss would be incurred exists only in very limited circumstances  such as in cost recovery arrangements 
accordingly  we have determined that percentage of completion accounting should not have been used to account for these specific arrangements  and the completed contract method should have been applied under sop under the completed contract method  revenues and certain costs are deferred until completion of the arrangement  which results in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition as compared to arrangements accounted for under percentage of completion accounting 
interaction between multiple revenue recognition accounting standards we determined there were accounting errors related to the application of sop  sop and related interpretive guidance under eitf some of our customer arrangements have multiple deliverable elements for which different accounting standards may govern the appropriate accounting treatment 
for those arrangements that contained more than incidental software and involved significant production  modification or customization of software or software related elements customized elements  we had previously applied the percentage of completion method of accounting under sop to all the elements under the arrangement  in accordance with our interpretation of sop this included certain future software  software related or non software related deliverables 
we have now determined that we should have applied the separation criteria set forth in eitf and sop to non software and software software related elements  respectively  to determine whether the various elements under these arrangements should be treated as separate units of accounting 
generally  the applicable separation criteria in eitf and sop requires sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each element 
if an undelivered non sop element cannot be separated from an sop element  depending on the nature of the elements and the timing of their delivery  the combined unit of accounting may be required to be accounted for under sop rather than under sop sop provides that the entire revenue associated with the combined elements should typically be deferred until the earlier of the point at which i the undelivered element s meet the criteria for separation or ii all elements within the combined unit of accounting have been delivered 
once there is only one remaining element to be delivered within the unit of accounting  the deferred revenue is recognized based on the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the last delivered element 
for certain of our multiple element arrangements involving customized elements where elements such as pcs  specified upgrade rights and or non essential hardware or software products remained undelivered  we frequently determined that the undelivered element could not be treated as a separate unit of accounting because fair value could not be established for all undelivered non customized elements 
accordingly  we should not have accounted for the revenue using percentage of completion accounting 
instead  the revenue should have been deferred in accordance with sop until such time as the fair value of the undelivered element could be established or all remaining elements have been delivered 
once there is only one remaining element to be delivered within the unit of accounting  the deferred revenue is recognized based on the revenue recognition guidance applicable to that last element 
application of sab and sop primarily as a result of our contract review  we determined that in respect of certain contracts providing for multiple deliverables  revenues had previously been recognized for which the revenue recognition criteria under sop or sab  as applicable  had not been met 
these errors related primarily to situations in which the fair value of an undelivered element under the arrangement could not be established 
in certain arrangements  we had treated commitments to make available a specified quantity of upgrades during the contract period as pcs 
under sop  where fair value cannot be established for pcs  revenue is recognized for the entire arrangement ratably over the pcs term 
we have now determined that commitments to make available a specified quantity of upgrades do not qualify as pcs and should be accounted for as a separate element of the arrangement from the pcs 
fair value could not be established for these commitments to make available a specified quantity of upgrades and as a result  the revenue related to the entire arrangement should have been deferred until the earlier of when i fair value of the undelivered element could be established or ii the undelivered element is delivered 
adjustments were made to defer the revenue and related costs until the upgrades were delivered 
in certain multiple element arrangements  we had recognized revenue upon delivery of products under the arrangement although other elements under the arrangement  such as future contractual or implicit pcs  had not been delivered 
if sufficient evidence of fair value cannot be established for an undelivered element  revenue related to the delivered products should be deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence  or fair value  or vsoe  for the undelivered element can be established or all the remaining elements have been delivered 
once there is only one remaining element  the deferred revenue is recognized based on the revenue recognition guidance applicable to that last undelivered element 
for instance  where pcs is the last undelivered element within the unit of accounting  deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the pcs term 
as we identified a number of contracts where sufficient evidence of fair value could not be established for the undelivered elements  adjustments were made to defer the revenue and related costs from the periods in which they were originally recorded and until such time as the appropriate criteria recognition were met 
in addition  we identified and corrected certain revenue recognition errors that related to the application of sab and sop the cumulative adjustments were previously recorded in  rather than restating prior periods  because they were not material either to  or the prior period results as originally reported 
as part of the third restatement  these adjustments have now been recorded in the appropriate periods as follows a cumulative correction previously recorded in the third quarter of has now been recorded primarily in  and prior periods resulting in an increase to revenue of in the third quarter of the adjustment was to correct for previously recognized revenue relating to past sales of optical networks equipment which we determined should have been deferred and recognized with the delivery of future contractual pcs and other services over the term of the pcs 
a cumulative correction in the fourth quarter of has now been recorded in the appropriate prior periods resulting in an increase to revenue of in the fourth quarter of the adjustment was to correct for previously recognized revenue related to an emea contract which should have been deferred until the delivery of certain undelivered elements such as services 
other revenue recognition adjustments in addition  errors related to application of the profit center definition were identified and corrected 
we made other revenue corrections related to the treatment of non cash incentives  and certain errors related to the classification of revenue 
other revenue recognition adjustments also reflect the impact on cost of revenues of corrections to standard costing on deferred costs related to deferred revenue included in inventory  and other adjustments to inventory to correct standard costing 
other adjustments other miscellaneous adjustments were identified and recorded in the third restatement  the more significant of which are summarized below 
health and welfare trust in prior periods  we had incorrectly netted employee benefit plan assets against the post employment and post retirement liabilities and incorrectly recognized gains and losses through the consolidated statement of operations related to certain assets held in an employee benefit trust in canada  or health and welfare trust 
historically  we had accounted for the assets of the health and welfare trust in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for post retirement benefit plans sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post employment benefit plans sfas which  among other things  permitted the netting of these plan assets against the post employment and post retirement liabilities if the assets are appropriately segregated and restricted 
upon further review  we determined that these assets should not have been netted against the liabilities because the health and welfare trust was not legally structured so as to segregate and restrict its assets to meet the definition of plan assets under sfas and sfas as a result  we corrected prior periods to present plan assets and liabilities on a gross basis  and to recognize gains and losses in oci 
we further determined that nortel was the primary beneficiary of the health and welfare trust  which met the definition of a variable interest entity under fin r consolidation of variable interest entities 
as a result  we corrected prior periods to consolidate the health and welfare trust into our results as of july   the effective date of fin r 
the combined impact of these adjustments in the third restatement was an increase in cost of revenues of and  an increase in selling  general and administrative expense of and  an increase in r d expense of and and an increase in other income of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   total assets increased by and liabilities increased by  including the related foreign exchange impact  as a result of these adjustments 
foreign exchange we had previously recorded foreign exchange gains in our consolidated financial statements  to correct a cumulative error from prior periods related to the functional currency designation of an entity in brazil 
this adjustment was previously recorded in rather than restating the prior periods  because the adjustment was not material either to the or the prior period results as originally reported 
as part of the third restatement  the impact of this adjustment has now been recorded in the appropriate prior periods  resulting in a decrease to other income for the year ended december  of and an increase for the year ended december  of we also identified and corrected additional foreign currency translation errors related to a pension liability under the supplemental executive retirement plan and historical balances for certain long term debt issue and discount costs 
the impact of the adjustments in the third restatement to correct these errors resulted in a net decrease to other income of for the year ended december  and a decrease of for the year ended december  in addition  the foreign exchange gains and losses  if any  resulting from the third restatement adjustments were recorded in other income net  and are presented in other adjustments in the consolidated statements of operations data tables above 
other we had previously capitalized legal and professional fees and real estate impairment costs relating to the transaction with flextronics for the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining manufacturing operations and related activities  accumulating those costs in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred costs starting in we have determined that these costs should instead have been recognized as incurred in prior periods 
accordingly  we have made adjustments to record these costs in the appropriate prior period  resulting in a decrease to gain loss on sale of businesses and assets of for the year ended december  in  we corrected certain other accounting errors we had identified that related to prior periods 
these adjustments were previously recorded in rather than restating prior periods because they were not material to or to the financial statements as originally reported 
however  as part of the third restatement  these adjustments have now been recorded in the appropriate prior periods 
these adjustments were as follows during  we had recorded a cumulative correction to reclassify an operating lease to a capital lease 
these adjustments have now been recorded to the appropriate prior periods which resulted in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in the year ended december  of and an increase in the year ended december  of we had previously recorded the release of a customer financing provision of in that should have been recorded in as a result  selling  general and administrative expense has increased by for the year ended december  and decreased by for the year ended december  we have corrected the useful lives of various leasehold improvement assets  included in plant and equipment net  which resulted in a decrease to depreciation expense for the year ended december  of and an increase for the year ended december  of reclassifications we had previously classified changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents as a component of net cash from used in operating activities of continuing operations 
we have now determined that  under sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents should instead be recorded as a component of net cash from used in investing activities of continuing operations 
accordingly  we have made adjustments of and for the years ended december  and  respectively  to reclassify changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents from net cash from used in operating activities of continuing operations to net cash from used in investing activities of continuing operations in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
certain sublease income has been reclassified in the consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of this adjustment resulted in an increase of and in selling  general and administrative expense and cost of revenues  respectively and an increase in other income of for the year ended december  for the year ended december   sublease income of was reclassified from selling  general and administrative expense to other income

annual shareholders meeting on april   we announced the postponement of our annual shareholders meeting for to june  due to the delay in filing this report 
revenue independent review as described in our annual report  management identified certain accounting practices and errors related to revenue recognition that it determined required adjustment as part of the second restatement 
in light of the resulting corrections to previously reported revenues totaling approximately billion  the audit committee determined to review the facts and circumstances leading to the restatement of these revenues for specific transactions identified in the second restatement  with a particular emphasis on the underlying conduct  or the revenue independent review 
the audit committee sought a full understanding of the historic events that required the revenues for these specific transactions to be restated and intended to consider any appropriate additional remedial measures  including those involving internal controls and processes 
the audit committee engaged wilmerhale to advise it in connection with this review 
because of the significant accounting issues involved in the inquiry  wilmerhale retained huron consulting services llc  or huron  to provide expert accounting assistance  and huron was involved in all phases of wilmerhale s work 
the audit committee launched its independent review after the second restatement was completed and did not seek to have wilmerhale and huron audit or otherwise review the substantive accuracy of our restated financial statements or review other aspects of our accounting practices not adjusted in the second restatement 
the revenue independent revenue focused principally on transactions that accounted for approximately billion of the billion in restated revenue  with a particular emphasis on transactions that accounted for approximately billion in that emphasis was appropriate because the size of the revenue restatement for billion of the total restated revenue of billion and the same types of errors made in reoccurred in subsequent years 
as more fully described in item a of the annual report  the revenue adjustments that were part of the second restatement primarily related to certain categories of transactions  and the revenue independent review has examined transactions in each of these categories 
the revenue independent review found that  in an effort to meet internal and external targets  the senior corporate finance management team  none of whom are current employees  changed our accounting policies several times during  either to defer revenue out to a subsequent period or pull revenue into the current period 
after changing internal accounting policies  senior corporate finance management did not understand the relevant us gaap requirements  misapplied these us gaap requirements  and in certain circumstances  turned a blind eye to these us gaap requirements 
as a result  the revenue independent review concluded that nortel recognized revenue for numerous transactions without regard for the proper accounting and this conduct was driven by the need to close revenue and earnings gaps 
the independent review of the facts leading to the initial erroneous recognition of revenues that were restated as a result of the second restatement is now complete 
while the focus of the revenue independent review was on the underlying conduct related to the transactions discussed above that were restated  this review found no additional accounting errors that should be investigated by management for possible restatement 
in the independent review summary approved by the board of directors and included in our annual report  the board of directors adopted a framework of governing remedial principles to prevent recurrence of the inappropriate accounting conduct  to rebuild a finance environment based on transparency and integrity  and to ensure sound financial reporting and comprehensive disclosure 
the board of directors directed management to implement those principles  through a series of remedial measures  across the company  to prevent any repetition of past misconduct and re establish a finance organization with values of transparency  integrity  and sound financial reporting as its cornerstone 
management s ongoing implementation efforts are described below and will continue following the filing of this report 
the board of directors has monitored the implementation efforts to date and will continue to regularly monitor management s implementation efforts 
regulatory actions and pending litigation we are under investigation by the sec and the osc enforcement staff 
in addition  we have received us federal grand jury subpoenas for the production of certain documents sought in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the us attorney s office for the northern district of texas  dallas division 
further  the integrated market enforcement team of the royal canadian mounted police  or rcmp  has advised us that it would be commencing a criminal investigation into our financial accounting situation 
regulatory sanctions may potentially require us to agree to remedial undertakings that may involve the appointment of an independent adviser to review  assess and monitor our accounting practices  financial reporting and disclosure processes and internal control systems 
we will continue to cooperate fully with all authorities in connection with these investigations and reviews 
in addition  numerous class action complaints and other actions have been filed against us and nnl  including class action complaints under erisa and an application in canada for leave to commence a derivative action against certain of our current and former officers and directors 
as described above under significant business developments proposed class action settlement  on february   we announced the proposed class action settlement of all pending and proposed shareholder class actions 
this settlement would be part of  and is conditioned on our reaching a global settlement encompassing all pending shareholder class actions and proposed shareholder class actions commenced against us and certain other defendants following our announcement of revised financial guidance during and our revision of our financial results and restatement of other prior periods 
the proposed class action settlement is also conditioned on the receipt of all required court  securities regulatory and stock exchange approvals 
on march   we announced that we and the lead plaintiffs reached an agreement on the related insurance and corporate governance matters including our insurers agreeing to pay in cash towards the settlement and us agreeing with our insurers to certain indemnification obligations 
we believe that these indemnification obligations would be unlikely to materially increase our total cash payment obligations under the proposed class action settlement 
the insurance payments would not reduce the amounts payable by us as noted below 
we also agreed to certain corporate governance enhancements  including the codification of certain of our current governance practices such as the annual election by our directors of a non executive board chair in our board of directors written mandate and the inclusion in our annual proxy circular and proxy statement of a report on certain of our other governance practices such as the process followed for the annual evaluation of the board  committees of the board and individual directors 
the proposed class action settlement would contain no admission of wrongdoing by us or any of the other defendants 
the proposed class action settlement does not relate to the ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations and does not encompass the related erisa class action or the pending application in canada for leave to commence a derivative action against certain of our current and former officers and directors 
for more information  see developments in and significant business developments proposed class action settlement 
our pending civil litigation and regulatory and criminal investigations are significant and  if decided against us  including if we are not able to reach a global definitive settlement in the case of the civil litigation proposed to be encompassed by the proposed class action settlement  could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity by requiring us to pay substantial judgments  settlements  fines  sanctions or other penalties  or requiring us to issue equity or equity related securities which could potentially result in the significant dilution of existing shareholders equity positions

d in the first quarter of  we expect the following two new product groups to form our reportable segments i enterprise solutions and packet networks  which combines optical networking solutions included in our carrier packet networks segment in  data networking and security solutions and portions of circuit and packet voice solutions included in both our carrier packet networks segment and enterprise networks segment in into a unified product group  and ii mobility and converged core networks  which combines our cdma solutions and gsm and umts solutions each in a separate segment in and other circuit and packet voice solutions included in our carrier packet networks segment in 
the following discusses significant demand trends in and for our various network solutions  which impacted our consolidated revenues 
we make reference to demand trends in developing and developed countries 
other than the united states and canada  which we consider developed  each of our geographic regions encompass both developed and developing countries 
other factors also impacted our and revenues  and this discussion should be read together with the geographic revenues and segment information sections 
cdma solutions in  revenues from our cdma solutions which increased over were positively impacted by significant expansion to meet increased subscriber demand  primarily in developed countries  and the evolution of wireless networks to next generation cdma technologies  which facilitate mobile high speed data services 
demand for new cdma technologies was generally greater in developed countries with an installed base of cdma solutions 
in addition  network completions and industry consolidation negatively impacted our revenues in certain regions 
revenues from tdma solutions were not significant 
in  revenues from our cdma solutions which decreased over were negatively impacted by substantial declines in tdma solutions across all regions as customers continued to migrate from the mature tdma technology to gsm and cdma wireless technologies 
revenues from cdma solutions were positively impacted in developed countries by factors that positively impacted revenues in network completions during the first half of negatively impacted our revenues in certain regions 
gsm and umts solutions in  revenues from our gsm and umts solutions which increased over reflected increases in both gsm solutions and umts solutions 
revenues from our gsm solutions were positively impacted by greater infrastructure sales  particularly in developing countries  related to increasing demand by subscribers 
in addition  industry consolidation and a mature installed base of gsm solutions negatively impacted our revenues in certain regions 
revenues from our umts solutions were positively impacted by higher subscriber demand to support progressively more sophisticated communication services and continued transition to this next generation technology primarily in developed countries where demand for these services is highest and to a lesser extent in developing countries 
in addition  industry consolidation negatively impacted our revenues in the us in  revenues from our gsm and umts solutions which increased over reflected increases in both gsm solutions and umts solutions 
revenues from these solutions were impacted in all regions by the same factors that were present in in addition  new contracts were obtained in certain regions 
circuit and packet voice solutions in  revenues from our circuit and packet voice solutions which increased over were positively impacted by an increase in packet voice solutions offset by declines in circuit voice solutions 
revenues from packet voice solutions were positively impacted by increased demand for next generation packetized communications  including voip  which resulted in reduced expenditures  primarily by service providers  for circuit voice solutions that do not readily accommodate these forms of communication 
demand for circuit and packet voice solutions varied across developed and developing countries 
in  revenues from our circuit and packet voice solutions which decreased over were negatively impacted by a substantial decrease in circuit voice solutions partially offset by an increase in packet voice solutions 
revenues from circuit voice solutions were negatively impacted due to continued reductions in capital expenditures by our service provider customers and a reduction in spending on our mature products in all regions where these solutions are marketed 
packet voice solutions were impacted in all regions by the same factors that positively impacted revenues in in addition  revenues from packet voice solutions were negatively impacted by enterprise customers in certain regions reducing their spending on certain of our products 
data networking and security solutions in  revenues from our data networking and security solutions which remained essentially flat over were negatively impacted by reduced demand for our legacy routing solutions and a mature router access market 
revenues were positively impacted by demand for ip based services and related next generation routing solutions  which include features such as power over ethernet 
this demand varied across developed and developing countries depending on the rate of network upgrade and expansion 
in  revenues from our data networking and security solutions which decreased over were impacted by factors that negatively impacted revenues in  particularly in developed countries and in relation to our mature products due to the ongoing shift toward ip based services 
optical networking solutions in  revenues from our optical networking solutions which increased over were positively impacted by increased demand for multimedia and other communications at broadband network speeds 
revenues from our metro networking solutions were positively impacted by the delivery of triple play services data  voice and multimedia by a range of service providers  particularly in developed countries where these services are readily available

liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash decreased during to  as of december   primarily due to cash payments of  net of cash acquired  relating to our acquisitions of pec and lg nortel  expenditures for plant and equipment of  and an outflow from operations of which included cash payments for restructuring of and payments of approximately for pension funding  partially offset by cash proceeds of primarily due to the transfer of manufacturing assets to flextronics and the sale of certain investments 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates resulted in a reduction in cash and cash equivalents in the following table summarizes our cash flows by activity and cash on hand as of december for the years ended december  net cash from used in operating activities of continuing operations net cash from used in investing activities of continuing operations net cash from used in financing activities of continuing operations effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net cash from used in continuing operations net cash from used in operating activities of discontinued operations net cash from used in investing activities of discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period operating activities in recent years our operating results have produced negative cash flow from operations due in large part to our inability to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  the continued negative impact on gross margin due to competitive pressures and other factors discussed throughout our md a 
in addition we have made significant payments related to our restructuring programs and pension plans 
in  our cash flows used in operating activities were due to net loss from continuing operations of  less adjustments of related to the net change in our operating assets and liabilities plus net adjustments of  for non cash and other items 
in  the primary adjustments to our net earnings from continuing operations for non cash and other items were shareholder litigation settlement expense of  amortization and depreciation of  substantially all of which was depreciation  and stock option expense of in  amortization and depreciation is expected to be slightly lower due to the sale of certain assets and stock option expense is expected to be higher than in due to the planned issuance of stock options in as part of our employee stock option plans

this was partially offset by collection of cash proceeds of approximately from the sale of certain customer financing notes receivable 
we had cash outflows for restructuring activities of related to our and restructuring plan and approximately for pension funding 
other changes in operating assets and liabilities included the following income tax payments of in compared to in primarily due to an increase in taxable income in certain taxable jurisdictions  and an increase of from other changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to the shareholder litigation settlement provision of in  the use of cash of relating to the change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable  restructuring outflows  supplemental pension funding and other changes in assets and liabilities partially offset by collection of long term or customer financing receivables 
this included a reduction in cash flows associated with accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable as discussed further under working capital metrics below

we had cash outflows for restructuring activities of primarily related to our restructuring plan and approximately in supplemental pension funding cash outflows to contribute to the reduction of our pension deficit 
other significant operating items included payments of approximately in the first quarter of associated with our employee bonus plan and restricted stock unit program based on performance 
in  we had increase in cash of from other changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily due to an increase in liabilities  including the deferred revenue 
we expect to pay in cash related to the proposed class action settlement 
the cash amount bears interest commencing march  at a prescribed rate and is to be placed in escrow on june  pending satisfactory completion of all conditions to the proposed class action settlement 
such cash payments would relate only to the encompassed actions and would not relate to certain erisa and derivative actions and the ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations 
on march   we announced that we and the lead plaintiffs reached an agreement on the related insurance and corporate governance matters including our insurers agreeing to pay in cash towards the settlement and us agreeing with our insurers to certain indemnification obligations 
on april   the insurance proceeds were placed into escrow by the insurers 
we believe that these indemnification obligations would be unlikely to materially increase our total cash payment obligations under the proposed class action settlement 
the insurance payments would not reduce the amounts payable by us 
for more information  see developments in and proposed class action settlement 
we expect cash contributions for pension funding for the full year to be approximately  including a portion related to a pension funding agreement in the united kingdom that requires additional contributions through april we are currently in discussions with the trustee of the united kingdom pension plan to establish a long term funding agreement which would increase the level of contributions 
in addition  we expect cash outflows of approximately for the full year related to both our restructuring plan and restructuring plan  and payments related to our employee bonus program in based on our performance 
for the full year  we expect to generate minimal cash from the sale of customer financing receivables 
working capital metrics working capital for each segment is primarily managed by our regional finance organization which manages accounts receivable performance and by our global operations organization which manages inventory and accounts payable 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable net inventory days days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable days sales outstanding in accounts receivables  or dso  measures the average number of days our accounts receivables are outstanding 
dso is a metric that approximates the measure of the average number of days from when we recognize revenue until we collect cash from our customers 
dso for each quarter is calculated by dividing the quarter end accounts receivable net balance by revenues for the quarter  in each case as determined in accordance with us gaap  and multiplying by days 
dso decreased by approximately days as of december  compared to december  due to an increase of approximately days as a result of the transfer of an estimated of receivables from lg to lg nortel with minimal corresponding revenue impact  more than offset by an overall decrease of approximately days primarily as a result of factors other than lg nortel 
in  we expect to focus on improving our collections process  however  we expect to experience fluctuations in collections performance in individual quarters 
dso increased as of december  compared to december  primarily due to reduction in accounts receivable securitization  increase in deferred revenues  one time recognition of of deferred revenue in our enterprise networks segment in  and reduced focus on collection activities particularly in the first half of  due to our restatement activities 
also contributing to the average increase of dso was increased cdma networks and gsm and umts networks revenues from a large number of contracts involving progress billing  due to significant portions of collections occurring upon project completion 
net inventory days  or nid  is a metric that approximates the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product 
nid for each quarter is calculated by dividing the average of the current quarter and prior quarter inventories net by the cost of revenues for the quarter  in each case as determined in accordance with us gaap  and multiplying by days 
finished goods inventory includes certain direct and incremental costs associated with arrangements where title and risk of loss was transferred to the customer but revenue was deferred due to other revenue recognition criteria not being met 
as of december    these deferred costs totaled  and  respectively 
nid decreased by approximately days as of december  compared to december  primarily due to lower inventory levels as a result of outsourcing of our manufacturing operations to flextronics partially offset by increased deferred costs associated with deferred revenues 
in  we expect that nid will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as future cost of sales and inventory levels fluctuate due in part to the movement in the deferred costs associated with deferred revenues 
nid increased as of december  compared to december  primarily due to an increase in deferred costs associated with deferred revenues  and an increase in inventory to meet new contract requirements  particularly in asia pacific for wireless projects  including bsnl 
days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable  or dpo  is a metric that approximates the average number of days from when we receive purchased goods and services until we pay our suppliers 
dpo for each quarter is calculated by dividing the quarter end trade and other accounts payable by the cost of revenues for the quarter  in each case  as determined in accordance with us gaap  and multiplying by days 
dpo decreased by approximately days as of december  compared to december  due to a transfer of accounts payable from lg to lg nortel without a corresponding cost of revenue impact 
the increase in dpo was more than offset by the stabilization of adhering to standard contract terms of days across our supplier base and process improvement for paying our suppliers 
dpo increased by approximately days as of december  compared to december  as we placed additional focus on establishing competitive payment terms with our suppliers and improving the processing of payments to match payment terms 
investing activities in  cash flows used in investing activities were and were primarily due to payments of for acquisitions of investments and businesses  net of cash acquired  including relating to the acquisition of pec and relating to our contribution to lg nortel  and for the purchase of plant and equipment  which were partially offset by proceeds of on the sale of assets including net proceeds of related to the transfer of certain manufacturing assets to flextronics and from the sale of certain investments and businesses which we no longer considered strategic including related to the sale of our remaining common shares of arris group  related to the sale of our investment in axtel  related to the sale of our interest in voltdelta and related to the sale of short term investments 
we also received proceeds of from the sale of plant and equipment 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were and were primarily due to net expenditures of on plant and equipment and associated with acquisitions of certain investments and businesses 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds of from the sale of certain investments and businesses which we no longer considered strategic  including from the sale of certain assets in cala  related to the sale of the common shares of arris group and related to the sale of the common shares of entrust 
financing activities in  cash flows used in financing activities were and were primarily from dividends of primarily paid by nnl on its outstanding preferred shares  a repayment of capital leases payable of and a net reduction of our notes payable by these amounts were partially offset by of proceeds from the issuance of nortel networks corporation common shares from the exercise of stock options 
in  our cash decreased compared to an increase of in  due to unfavorable effects of changes in foreign exchange rates primarily of the euro and the british pound against the us dollar 
in  cash flows from our discontinued operations were primarily related to the collection of customer financing receivables in in  cash flows used in financing activities were and were primarily due to used to reduce our long term debt  a repayment of capital leases payable of and dividends of paid by nnl related to its outstanding preferred shares 
these amounts were partially offset by of proceeds from the issuance of nortel networks corporation common shares from the exercise of stock options and an increase in our notes payable by a net amount of the reduction of our long term debt was primarily due to the extinguishment of debt of related to the purchase of land and two buildings in the us that were previously leased by us 
in  our cash increased compared to in due to favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
approximately in of the favorable impact was the result of favorable changes in the euro and the british pound against the us dollar 
in  our discontinued operations generated net cash of related to the continued wind down of our discontinued operations 
future uses and sources of liquidity the forward looking statements below are subject to important risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict and the actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated 
see the risk factors section in this report 
future uses of liquidity as of december   our cash requirements for the next months are primarily expected to consist of funding for operations  including our investments in r d  and the following items repayment of of notes due in june  costs in relation to the restatement and remedial measure activities  regulatory and other legal proceedings  including the proposed cash payment payable by nnc related to the proposed class action settlement 
the cash amount bears interest commencing march  at a prescribed rate and is to be held in escrow on june  pending satisfactory completion of all conditions to the proposed class action settlement 
in addition  the resolution of other matters not encompassed by the proposed class action settlement  including regulatory matters  is uncertain and we may be subject to substantial additional payments  judgments  settlements  fines or penalties  capital expenditures of approximately  pension and post retirement and post employment benefit funding of approximately  costs related to workforce reduction and other restructuring activities of approximately  investment in certain businesses including approximately for the acquisition of tasman networks paid in february  and our finance transformation project which will include  among other things  implementing sap to provide an integrated global financial system 
in addition  the credit facility of  due in february is subject to acceleration until such time that we obtain a waiver for defaults under the credit facility 
any inability to refinance the credit facility would adversely affect our liquidity 
also  from time to time  we may purchase our outstanding debt securities and or convertible notes in privately negotiated or open market transactions  by tender offer or otherwise  in compliance with applicable laws

where the arrangement specifies quantity  pricing and timing information  we have included that arrangement in the amounts presented above 
in certain cases  these arrangements define an end date of the contract  but do not specify timing of payments between december  and the end date of the agreement 
in those cases  we have estimated the timing of the payments based on forecasted usage rates 
during the third quarter of  we renegotiated a key supply arrangement that was initially put into place prior to the industry and economic downturn that commenced in the renegotiated agreement is reflective of the current market environment  and the terms include a reduction in our minimum spending levels with an extension in the time period  from to  within which these minimum levels must be met 
as well  we are no longer obligated to compensate the supplier for direct costs if the minimum spending levels are not met 
the renegotiated agreement includes a graduated liquidated damages remedy for the benefit of the supplier if the minimum spending levels are not met by the end of the agreement in however  based upon the renegotiated terms  we expect to meet the minimum spending levels 
the remaining minimum purchase obligation has been reflected in the contractual cash obligations table above 
as part of our agreement with flextronics regarding the divestiture of substantially all of our remaining manufacturing operations  flextronics has the ability in certain cases to exercise rights to sell back to us certain inventory and equipment after the expiration of a specified period of up to fifteen months following each respective closing date 
we do not expect such rights to be exercised with respect to any material amount of inventory and or equipment 
outsourcing contracts outsourcing contract amounts in the table above represent our minimum contractual obligation for services provided to us for a portion of our information services function 
the amount payable under our outsourcing contracts is variable to the extent that our hardware volumes and workforce fluctuates from the baseline levels contained in the contracts and our contractual obligation could increase above such baseline amount 
if our hardware volumes or workforce were to fall below the baseline levels in the contracts  we would be required to make the minimum payments included above 
obligations under special charges obligations under special charges in the above table reflect undiscounted amounts related to contract settlement and lease costs and are expected to be substantially drawn down by the end of balance sheet provisions of for workforce reduction costs  included in restructuring in current liabilities in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  have not been reflected in the contractual cash obligations table above 
pension and post retirement obligations during  we made cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of and to our post retirement benefit plans of in  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately to our defined benefit pension plans  including a portion related to a pension funding agreement in the united kingdom that requires additional contributions through april and approximately to our post retirement benefit plans 
we are currently in discussions with the trustee of our pension plan in the united kingdom to establish a long term funding agreement which would increase the level of contributions 
other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheets other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheets relate to asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation accruals 
payment information related to our asset retirement obligations has been presented based on the termination date after the first renewal period of the associated lease contracts 
payment information related to our deferred compensation accruals has been presented based on the anticipated retirement dates of the employees participating in the programs 
customer financing generally  customer financing arrangements may include financing with deferred payment terms in connection with the sale of our products and services  as well as funding for non product costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services

as part of the lg nortel joint venture agreement  lg will be entitled to payments from us over a two year period up to a maximum of based on achievement by lg nortel of certain business goals 
future sources of liquidity as of december  our primary source of liquidity was cash and we expect this to continue throughout based on past performance and current expectations we do not expect our operations to generate significant cash flow in in addition  in  we expect our continued transfer of certain manufacturing assets to flextronics  and the sale of other non core assets to continue to be a source of cash at similar levels as in we believe our cash will be sufficient to fund the changes to our business model in accordance with our strategic plan see business overview our strategy  fund our investments and meet our customer commitments for at least the month period commencing december   including the cash expenditures outlined in our future uses of liquidity 
our ability to generate sustainable cash from operations will be dependent on our ability to generate profitable revenue streams and reduce our operating expenses 
if capital spending by our customers changes from what we currently expect  our revenues and cash flows may be materially lower and we may be required to further reduce our investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements 
in making this statement  we have not assumed the need to make any payments in respect of fines or other penalties or judgments or settlements in connection with our pending civil litigation not encompassed by the proposed class action settlement or regulatory or criminal investigations related to the restatements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  other than anticipated professional fees and expenses 
the proposed class action settlement  if finalized and approved  will have a material impact on our liquidity as a result of the proposed cash payment 
the cash amount bears interest commencing march  at a prescribed rate and is to be placed in escrow on june  pending satisfactory completion of all conditions to the proposed class action settlement 
we also expect that the proposed issuance of  nortel networks corporation common shares representing of our equity as of february  will result in a significant dilution of existing equity positions and may adversely affect our ability to finance using equity and equity related securities in the future 
in the event of a share consolidation of nortel networks corporation common shares  the number of nortel networks corporation common shares to be issued pursuant to the proposed class action settlement would be adjusted accordingly 
the proposed class action settlement is subject to several conditions 
in addition  we continue to be subject to significant regulatory and criminal investigations which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity by requiring us to pay substantial fines or other penalties or settlements or by limiting our access to capital market transactions

effective october   nnl and edc entered into an amendment of the edc support facility  or the edc amendment  that maintained the total edc support facility at up to  including the existing of committed support for performance bonds and similar instruments  and the extension of the maturity date of the edc support facility for an additional year to december  the edc amendment modified the facility by combining the two previously uncommitted tranches under the edc support facility one for performance bonds or similar instruments and one for receivables sales and securitizations into a single uncommitted revolving general purpose tranche to support our receivables sales  securitizations and performance bonds issuance 
the edc support facility provides that edc may suspend its obligation to issue nnl any additional support if events occur that would have a material adverse effect on nnl s business  financial position or results of operation 
the edc support facility does not materially restrict nnl s ability to sell any of its assets subject to certain maximum amounts or to purchase or pre pay any of its currently outstanding debt 
the edc support facility can be suspended or terminated if nnl s senior long term debt rating by moody s investors service  or moody s  has been downgraded to less than b or if its debt rating by standard poor s  or s p  has been downgraded to less than b 
in connection with the edc amendment  each of the guarantee and security agreements previously guaranteeing or securing the obligations of nortel and its subsidiaries under the edc support facility and nortel s public debt securities were terminated and the assets of nortel and its subsidiaries pledged under the security agreements were released in full 
edc also agreed to provide future support under the edc support facility on an unsecured basis and without the guarantees of nnl s subsidiaries provided that should nnl or its subsidiaries incur or guarantee certain indebtedness in the future above agreed thresholds of in north america and outside of north america  equal and ratable security and or guarantees of nnl s obligations under the edc support facility would be required at that time 
effective february   nnl s obligations under the edc support facility became equally and ratably secured with the credit facility and the bonds by a pledge of substantially all of the us and canadian assets of nnc and nnl and the us assets of nni in accordance with the terms of the edc support facility 
nnl s obligations under the edc support facility also were guaranteed by nnc and nni at such time 
these guarantees and security agreements will terminate when the credit facility is repaid 
as a result of the delayed filing of this report with the sec and other related breaches  edc has the right to refuse to issue additional support and terminate its commitments under the support facility  or the edc support facility  or require that nnl cash collateralize all existing support 
as of april   there was approximately of outstanding support under the edc support facility 
we are currently in discussions with edc under the edc support facility to negotiate waivers related to the third restatement and the delay in filing this report and the anticipated delay in filing our first quarter report 
although we expect to reach an agreement with edc with respect to the terms of an acceptable waiver  there can be no assurance that we will receive such waivers

there can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered or that these ratings agencies will not issue adverse commentaries  potentially resulting in higher financing costs and reduced access to capital markets or alternative financing arrangements 
a reduction in our credit ratings may also affect our ability  and the cost  to securitize receivables  obtain bid  performance related and other bonds  access the edc support facility and or enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements bid  performance related and other bonds we have entered into bid  performance related and other bonds in connection with various contracts 
bid bonds generally have a term of less than twelve months  depending on the length of the bid period for the applicable contract 
performance related and other bonds generally have a term of twelve months and are typically renewed  as required  over the term of the applicable contract 
the various contracts to which these bonds apply generally have terms ranging from two to five years 
any potential payments which might become due under these bonds would be related to our non performance under the applicable contract 
historically  we have not had to make material payments and we do not anticipate that we will be required to make material payments under these types of bonds 
the following table provides information related to these types of bonds as of december  december  bid and performance related bonds a other bonds b total bid  performance related and other bonds a net of restricted cash and cash equivalents amounts of and as of december  and december   respectively 
b net of restricted cash and cash equivalents amounts of and as of december  and december   respectively 
the criteria under which bid  performance related and other bonds can be obtained changed due to the industry environment primarily in and during that timeframe  in addition to the payment of higher fees  we experienced significant cash collateral requirements in connection with obtaining new bid  performance related and other bonds 
given that the edc support facility is used to support bid and performance bonds with varying terms  including those with at least day terms  we will likely need to increase our use of cash collateral to support these obligations beginning on january  absent a further extension of the facility 
any bid or performance related bonds with terms that extend beyond december  are currently not eligible for the support provided by this facility

receivables securitization and certain variable interest transactions in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  or fin  and in december  the fasb issued a revision of fin fin revised  or fin r 
fin r provides guidance with respect to the consolidation of variable interest entities  or vies 
vies are characterized as entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or there is not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
reporting entities which have a variable interest in such an entity and are deemed to be the primary beneficiary must consolidate the variable interest entity 
certain of our lease financing transactions were structured through single transaction vies that did not have sufficient equity at risk as defined in fin r 
effective july   we prospectively began consolidating two vies for which we were considered the primary beneficiary following the guidance of fin  on the basis that we retained certain risks associated with guaranteeing recovery of the unamortized principal balance of the vies debt  which represented the majority of the risks associated with the respective vies activities 
the amount of the guarantees will be adjusted over time as the underlying debt matures 
during  the debt related to one of the vies was extinguished and as a result consolidation of this vie was no longer required 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included of long term debt and of plant and equipment net related to these vies 
these amounts represented both the collateral and maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these vies 
effective april   we began consolidating a vie for which we were considered the primary beneficiary under fin r 
the vie is a cellular phone operator in russia 
loans to this entity comprise the majority of the entity s subordinated financial support 
no creditor of the vie has recourse to us 
this entity s financial results have been consolidated using the most recent financial information available 
on june   we acquired pec  a vie  for which we were considered the primary beneficiary under fin r 
no creditor of the vie has recourse to us 
our consolidated financial results include pec s operating results from the date of the acquisition 
on november   we formed lg nortel co 
ltd  which is a vie 
we are considered the primary beneficiary under fin r 
no creditor of the entity has recourse to us 
this entity s financial results have been consolidated from the date of formation 
as a result of the third restatement adjustments  effective  july   we began to consolidate the health and welfare trust  a vie  for which we were considered the primary beneficiary under fin r 
see restatements  nortel audit committee independent review  material weaknesses  related matters 
as of december   we did not have any variable interests related to transfers of financial assets 
we have other financial interests and contractual arrangements which would meet the definition of a variable interest under fin r  including investments in other companies and joint ventures  customer financing arrangements  and guarantees and indemnification arrangements 
as of december   none of these other interests or arrangements were considered significant variable interests and  therefore  did not meet the requirements for consolidation or disclosure under fin r 
we have also conducted certain receivable sales transactions either directly with financial institutions or with multi seller conduits 
under some of these agreements  we have continued as servicing agent and or have provided limited recourse 
the fair value of these retained interests is based on the market value of servicing the receivables  historical payment patterns  expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates as applicable 
where we have acted as the servicing agent  we generally have not recorded an asset or liability related to servicing as the annual servicing fees were equivalent to those that would have been paid to a third party servicing agent 
also  we have not historically experienced significant credit losses with respect to receivables sold with limited recourse 
as of december   we were not required to  and did not  consolidate or provide any of the additional disclosures set out in fin r with respect to the variable interest entities involving receivable sales 
additionally  we have agreed to indemnify some of our counterparties in certain receivables securitization transactions 
the indemnifications provided to counterparties in these types of transactions may require us to compensate counterparties for costs incurred as a result of changes in laws and regulations including tax legislation or in the interpretations of such laws and regulations  or as a result of regulatory penalties that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction 
certain receivables securitization transactions include indemnifications requiring the repurchase of the receivables if the particular transaction becomes invalid 
as of december   we had approximately of securitized receivables which were subject to repurchase under this provision  in which case we would assume all rights to collect such receivables 
the indemnification provisions generally expire upon expiration of the securitization agreements  which extend through  or collection of the receivable amount by the counterparty 
we are generally unable to estimate the maximum potential liability for all of these types of indemnification guarantees as certain agreements do not specify a maximum amount and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent events  the nature and likelihood of which cannot be determined at this time 
historically  we have not made any significant indemnification payments or receivable repurchases under these agreements and no significant liability has been accrued in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements with respect to the obligation associated with these guarantees 
other indemnifications or guarantees through our normal course of business  we have also entered into other indemnifications or guarantees that arise in various types of arrangements including third party debt agreements  business sale and business combination agreements  intellectual property indemnification obligations  lease agreements  indemnification of banks and agents under credit and support facilities and security agreements  and other indemnification agreements 
in  we did not make any significant payments under any of these indemnifications or guarantees 
we have agreed to indemnify the banks and agents under our credit facilities against costs or losses resulting from changes in laws and regulations which would increase the banks costs or reduce their return and from any legal action brought against the banks or agents related to the use of loan proceeds 
we have agreed to indemnify edc under the edc support facility against any legal action brought against edc that relates to the provision of support under the edc support facility 
this indemnification generally applies to issues that arise during the term of the edc support facility 
for additional information  see note and note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
we are unable to estimate the maximum potential liability for these types of indemnification guarantees as the agreements typically do not specify a maximum amount and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent events  the nature and likelihood of which cannot be determined at this time 
historically  we have not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no significant liability has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to the obligations associated with these indemnification guarantees 
as part of the proposed class action settlement  we agreed with our insurers to certain indemnification obligations 
we believe that these indemnification obligations would be unlikely to materially increase our total cash payment obligations under the proposed class action settlement 
the insurance payments would not reduce the amounts payable by us 
for more information  see developments in and significant business developments proposed class action settlement and the risk factors and legal proceedings section of this report 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies generally accepted in the us  which require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for inventory  provisions for product warranties  income taxes  goodwill valuation  pension and post retirement benefits  special charges and other contingencies 
in general  any changes in estimates or assumptions relating to revenue recognition  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for inventory and other contingencies excluding legal contingencies are directly reflected in the results of our reportable operating segments 
changes in estimates or assumptions pertaining to our tax asset valuations  our pension and post retirement benefits and our legal contingencies are generally not reflected in our reportable operating segments  but are reflected on a consolidated basis 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of activities  from custom design and installation over a period of time to a single delivery of equipment to a customer 
our networking solutions also cover a broad range of technologies and are offered on a global basis 
as a result  our revenue recognition policies can differ depending on the level of customization within the solution and the contractual terms with the customer 
newer technologies within one of our reporting segments may also have different revenue recognition policies  depending on  among other factors  the specific performance and acceptance criteria within the applicable contract 
therefore  management must use significant judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations  not only based on the networking solution  but also within networking solutions based on reviewing the level of customization and contractual terms with the customer 
as a result  our revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of solutions sold and the geographic region in which they are sold 
when a customer arrangement involves multiple deliverables where the deliverables are governed by more than one authoritative standard  we evaluate all deliverables to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting based on the following criteria whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the contract includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and is substantially in our control 
our determination of whether deliverables within a multiple element arrangement can be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes involves significant estimates and judgment  such as whether fair value can be established on undelivered obligations and or whether delivered elements have standalone value to the customer 
changes to our assessment of the accounting units in an arrangement and or our ability to establish fair values could significantly change the timing of revenue recognition 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for all units of accounting in the contract  revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting or element based on relative fair values 
in situations where there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all undelivered elements  but not for delivered elements  the residual method is used to allocate the contract consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
if sufficient evidence of fair value cannot be established for an undelivered element  revenue related to delivered elements is deferred until the earlier of when sufficient fair value is established or all remaining elements have been delivered 
once there is only one remaining element to be delivered within the unit of accounting  the deferred revenue is recognized based on the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the last delivered element 
for instance  where post contract support is the last delivered element within the unit of accounting  the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the remaining post contract support term once post contract support is the only undelivered element 
our assessment of which revenue recognition guidance is appropriate to account for a deliverable also can involve significant judgment 
for instance  the determination of whether software is more than incidental to hardware can impact whether the hardware is accounted for under software revenue recognition guidance or based on general revenue recognition guidance 
this assessment could significantly impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
for elements related to customized network solutions and certain network build outs  revenues are recognized under aicpa statement of position  generally using the percentage of completion method 
in using the percentage of completion method  revenues are generally recorded based on a measure of the percentage of costs incurred to date on a contract relative to the estimated total expected contract costs 
profit estimates on long term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become known 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of certain phases of work 
contract revenues recognized  based on costs incurred towards the completion of the project  that are unbilled are accumulated in the contracts in progress account included in accounts receivable net 
billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on long term contracts are recorded as advance billings in excess of revenues recognized to date on contracts within other accrued liabilities 
significant judgment is often required when estimating total contract costs and progress to completion on these arrangements  as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract 
management uses historical experience  project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
changes in these estimates could result in a material impact on revenues and net earnings loss 
revenue for hardware that does not require significant customization  and where any software is considered incidental  is recognized under sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab under sab  revenue is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for hardware  delivery is considered to have occurred upon shipment provided that risk of loss  and title in certain jurisdictions  have been transferred to the customer 
for arrangements where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met because legal title or risk of loss on products did not transfer to the buyer until final payment had been received or where delivery had not occurred  revenue is deferred to a later period when title or risk of loss passes either on delivery or on receipt of payment from the customer 
for arrangements where the customer agrees to purchase products but we retain possession until the customer requests shipment  or bill and hold arrangements  revenue is not recognized until delivery to the customer has occurred and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we make certain sales through multiple distribution channels  primarily resellers and distributors 
these customers are generally given certain rights of return 
for products sold through these distribution channels  revenue is recognized from product sale at the time of shipment to the distribution channel when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
accruals for estimated sales returns and other allowances and deferrals are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
these provisions are based on contract terms and prior claims experience and involve significant estimates 
if these estimates are significantly different from actual results  our revenue could be impacted 
we provide extended payment terms on certain software contracts and may sell these receivables to third parties 
the fees on these contracts are considered fixed or determinable if the contracts are similar to others for which we have a standard business practice of providing extended payment terms and have a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions 
if fees are not considered fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  revenue for delivered products is deferred until the fees become legally due and payable and therefore estimates and judgment in this area can impact the timing of revenue recognition 
the collectibility of trade and notes receivables is also critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade or notes receivables are reasonably assured of collection and whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers that could result in our inability to collect the receivables 
we will defer revenue but recognize related costs if we are uncertain about whether we will be able to collect the receivable 
as a result  our estimates and judgment regarding customer credit quality could significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
for further information on our revenue recognition policies relating to our material revenue streams  you should also refer to note d of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
provisions for doubtful accounts in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade  notes and long term receivables due from customers  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider age of the receivables  a customer s ability to meet and sustain its financial commitments  a customer s current and projected financial condition  collection experience with the customer  historical bad debt experience with the customer  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and the economy in general once we consider all of these individual factors  an appropriate provision is then made  which takes into consideration the likelihood loss and our ability to establish a reasonable estimate 
in addition to these individual assessments  a regional except asia accounts past due provision is established for outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts based on a review of balances greater than six months past due 
a regional trend analysis  based on past and expected write off activity  is performed on a regular basis to determine the likelihood of loss and establish a reasonable estimate 
we recorded net trade and customer financing receivable recoveries related to continuing operations of  and in  and  respectively  primarily related to favorable settlements related to our sale or restructuring of various receivables as well as net recoveries on other trade and customer financing receivables due to subsequent collections for amounts exceeding our original estimates of net recovery 
these recoveries were partially offset by receivable provisions recorded during and related to our normal business activity 
the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and long term receivable balances and related reserves of our continuing operations as of december  december  gross accounts receivable provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable net accounts receivable provision as a percentage of gross accounts receivables gross long term receivables provision for doubtful accounts net long term receivables long term receivable provision as a percentage of gross long term receivables provisions for inventory management must make estimates about the future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate provisions for inventory 
when making these estimates  we consider general economic conditions and growth prospects within our customers ultimate marketplace  and the market acceptance of our current and pending products 
these judgments must be made in the context of our customers shifting technology needs and changes in the geographic mix of our customers 
with respect to our provisioning policy  in general  we fully reserve for surplus inventory in excess of our day demand forecast or that we deem to be obsolete 
generally  our inventory provisions have an inverse relationship with the projected demand for our products 
for example  our provisions usually increase as projected demand decreases due to adverse changes in the conditions mentioned above 
we have experienced significant changes in required provisions in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as declining market conditions 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of any of these conditions could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
our inventory includes certain direct and incremental deferred costs associated with arrangements where title and risk of loss was transferred to customers but revenue was deferred due to other revenue recognition criteria not being met 
we have not recorded provision against this type of inventory 
the following table summarizes our inventory balances and other related reserves of our continuing operations as of december  december  gross inventory inventory provisions inventories net a inventory provisions as a percentage of gross inventory a includes long term portion of inventory related to the deferred costs  which is included in other assets 
inventory provisions decreased as a result of of scrapped inventory and of reductions due to sale of inventory partially offset by of additional inventory provisions and of foreign exchange fluctuations  reclassifications and other adjustments 
in the future  we may be required to make significant adjustments to these provisions for the sale and or disposition of inventory that was provided for in prior periods 
provisions for product warranties provisions are recorded for estimated costs related to warranties given to customers on our products to cover defects 
these provisions are calculated based on historical return rates as well as on estimates  which take into consideration the historical material replacement costs and the associated labor costs to correct the product defect 
known product defects are specifically provided for as we become aware of such defects 
revisions are made when actual experience differs materially from historical experience 
these provisions for product warranties are part of the cost of revenues and are accrued when the revenue is recognized 
they represent the best possible estimate  at the time the sale is made  of the expenses to be incurred under the warranty granted 
warranty terms generally range from one to six years from the date of sale depending upon the product 
as part of our warranty provision review  we reduced our provision by approximately in the fourth quarter of this adjustment was in addition to any provisions we have taken in the year 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of revenues based on associated material costs and technical support labor costs 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the product 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer warranty claims and projected claims within the warranty period 
the following table summarizes the accrual for product warranties that was recorded as part of other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december balance at the beginning of the year payments warranties issued revisions balance at the end of the year we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon warranty terms  ongoing product failure rates  historical material replacement costs and the associated labor to correct the product defect 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than the expectations on which the accrual is based  our gross margin could be negatively affected 
income taxes tax asset valuation our net deferred tax assets balance  excluding discontinued operations  was  as of december  and  as of december  the increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange effects and the release of a liability related to the retroactive application of the apa 
we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  all of which are available to reduce future taxes payable in our significant tax jurisdictions 
generally  our loss carryforward periods range from seven years to an indefinite period 
as a result  we do not expect that a significant portion of these carryforwards will expire in the near future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on available evidence  both positive and negative  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  history of loss carryforwards and other tax assets expiring  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets  the nature of the income that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets  our net earnings loss  and future earnings potential determined through the use of internal forecasts 
in evaluating the positive and negative evidence  the weight given to each type of evidence must be proportionate to the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
if it is our belief that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
we are in a cumulative loss position in certain of our material jurisdictions 
primarily for this reason  we have recorded an income tax valuation allowance against a portion of these deferred income tax assets 
however  due to the fact that the majority of the carryforwards do not expire in the near future and our future expectations of earnings  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred income tax asset recorded as of december  will be realized 
we continue to review all available positive and negative evidence in each jurisdiction and our valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future as a result of this ongoing review 
given the magnitude of our valuation allowance  future adjustments to this allowance based on actual results could result in a significant adjustment to our net earnings loss 
as of december   our gross income tax valuation allowances decreased to  compared to  as of december  the decrease was primarily due to the impacts of foreign exchange  deferred taxes that expired during the year and tax return and other adjustments offset by additional valuation allowances recorded against the tax benefit of current period losses in certain jurisdictions 
we assessed positive evidence including forecasts of future taxable income to support realization of the net deferred tax assets  and negative evidence including our cumulative loss position  and concluded that the valuation allowances as of december  were appropriate 
tax contingencies we are subject to ongoing examinations by certain taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we regularly assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes 
we believe that we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that we believe are probable as a result of any ongoing or future examination 
specifically  the tax authorities in brazil have completed an examination of a prior taxation years and have issued assessments in the amount of we are currently in the process of appealing these assessments and believe that we have adequately provided for tax adjustments that are probable as a result of the outcome of the ongoing appeals process 
in addition  tax authorities in france have issued two preliminary notices of proposed assessment in respect of the and taxation years 
these assessments collectively propose adjustments to taxable income of approximately as well as certain adjustments to withholding and other taxes of approximately plus applicable interest and penalties 
other than the withholding and other taxes  we have sufficient loss carry forwards to absorb the entire amount of the proposed assessment 
however  no amount has been provided for these assessments since we believe that the proposed assessments are without merit and any potential tax adjustments that could result from these ongoing examinations cannot be quantified at this time 
we had previously entered into apas with the taxation authorities of the us and canada in connection with our intercompany transfer pricing and cost sharing arrangements between canada and the us these arrangements expired in and in  we filed apa requests with the taxation authorities of the us  canada and the united kingdom us that applied to the taxation years beginning in the apa requests are currently under consideration but the tax authorities have not begun to negotiate the terms of the arrangement 
we have applied the transfer pricing methodology proposed in the apa requests in preparing our tax returns and accounts beginning in as part of the apa applications  we have requested that the methodology adopted in be applied retroactively to the taxation year 
such retroactive application would result in an increase in taxable income in certain jurisdictions offset by an equal decrease in taxable income in the other jurisdictions 
we had previously concluded that it was probable that the retroactive application of the proposed methodology would be accepted by the tax authorities and prepared our income tax estimates both current and deferred taxes on the basis that the taxation year would be governed by the apa submission 
as a result  we had previously provided approximately for taxes and interest in various tax jurisdictions that would be due as a result of retroactive application of the apa 
in the fourth quarter of  we obtained new information and as a result can no longer conclude that it is probable that the apa will be retroactively applied 
we have recalculated our current and deferred tax balances assuming the tax year would not be subject to the retroactive application of the apa 
as a result  the gross deferred income tax balances in our material jurisdictions were recalculated on an as filed basis  and the liability of for taxes and interest that was previously accrued was released in the fourth quarter of the outcome of the apa applications is uncertain and additional possible losses  as they relate to the apa negotiations  cannot be determined at this time 
however  we do not believe it is probable that the ultimate resolution of these negotiations will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite our current belief  if this matter is resolved unfavorably  it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
goodwill valuation we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis as of october of each year and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test between annual tests include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  a change in reportable segments  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 
measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more fair value measures 
these measures involve significant management judgment and as a result are subject to change 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  resulting in an implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded in net earnings loss 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined by allocating our total fair value among our reporting units using an average of three valuation models  a discounted cash flow model  or the dcf model  a model based on estimated revenue multiples  or the revenue multiple model  and a model based on a multiple of estimated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or the ebitda multiple model 
all of these valuation models involve significant assumptions regarding our future operating performance 
the following are the significant assumptions involved in each model dcf model assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  gross margin percentages  discount rates and terminal growth rates  revenue multiple model estimates of revenue growth and the selection of comparable companies to determine an appropriate multiple  and ebitda multiple model projected ebitda and the selection of comparable companies to determine an appropriate multiple 
of our total goodwill of  as of december    was attributable to our enterprise networks business 
accordingly  changes in our assumptions related to the fair value of our enterprise networks business are most likely to result in an impairment charge in the future 
based on a sensitivity analysis  we changed certain significant assumptions in order to assess the impact on the value of our enterprise networks goodwill 
we determined that a decrease as high as in projected enterprise revenues  coupled with the assumption of no future enterprise networks revenue growth  would not trigger a goodwill impairment 
accordingly  a substantial change in our assumptions would be required before a goodwill impairment would be triggered 
in and  we concluded that an impairment of our goodwill did not exist and no write down was recorded 
in the first quarter of  we changed our reportable segments see business overview our segments 
this triggered an interim impairment test in the first quarter of in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we performed this test and concluded that there was no impairment 
the carrying value of goodwill was  as of december  and  as of december  the increase in goodwill primarily related to the acquisition of pec and the formation of lg nortel

pension and post retirement benefits we maintain various pension and post retirement benefit plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and post retirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
for  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was on a weighted average basis  which was the rate determined at september  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets remained the same as the discount rates used to estimate the net pension obligations and expenses for were and  respectively  on a weighted average basis  compared to and  respectively  in the key assumption used to estimate the post retirement benefit costs for was an expected discount rate of and for the obligations and costs  respectively  both on a weighted average basis 
the discount rates for the obligations and costs decreased in to and  respectively  from and  respectively  in due to the decline experienced in global interest rates during through the difference between the discount rate reported for the net pension obligations and expenses and discount rate reported for the net post retirement benefit obligations and costs is due to the weighted average calculation as a result of the number of countries in which we offer either pension or pension and post retirement benefits 
in developing these assumptions  we evaluated  among other things  input from our actuaries  duration of the liabilities  and current high quality bond rates 
changes in net periodic pension and post retirement benefit expense may occur in the future due to changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events 
the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension and post retirement benefit expense to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant effect on pre tax effect on pre tax post change in assumption pension expense retirement benefit expense increase decrease increase decrease percentage point increase in the expected return on assets n a percentage point decrease in the expected return on assets n a percentage point increase in the discount rate percentage point decrease in the discount rate excludes settlement costs lump sum and termination payments to participants which discharges our obligations plan assets were primarily comprised of debt and equity securities 
included in the equity securities of the defined benefit plan were common shares of nortel networks corporation  held directly or through pooled funds  with an aggregate market value of of total plan assets as of december  and of total plan assets as of december  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had unrecognized net actuarial losses related to the defined benefit plans of  which could result in an increase to pension expenses in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the post retirement benefit plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of at the end of the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at september  as a result of reductions in discount rates which more than offset the favorable impacts of strong pension asset returns and the contributions made by us during accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of before tax to other comprehensive income for the minimum pension liability 
a similar charge may be required in the future as the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on the value of our pension plan assets and obligations are measured 
during  we made cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of and to our post retirement benefit plans of in  we expect to make cash contributions of approximately to our defined benefit pension plans  including a portion related to a pension funding agreement in the united kingdom that requires contributions through april and approximately to our post retirement benefit plans 
we are currently in discussions with the trustee of our pension plan in the united kingdom pension to establish a long term funding agreement which would increase the level of contributions 
for  we are lowering our expected rate of return on plan assets from to for defined benefit pension plans 
also for  we are lowering our discount rate on a weighted average basis for pension expenses from to for the defined benefit pension plans and from to for post retirement benefit plans given the declining trend in current global interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be significantly reduced 
for additional information  see employee benefit plans in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
special charges in  we entered into an unprecedented period of business realignment in response to a significant adjustment in the industry 
we implemented a company wide restructuring plan to streamline our operations and activities around core markets and operations  which included significant workforce reductions  global real estate closures and dispositions  substantial write downs of our plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets and extensive contract settlements with customers and suppliers around the world 
as a result of these actions  our workforce declined significantly from january  to december  and over the same time period  we significantly reduced our facilities 
in  our focus was on managing each of our businesses based on financial performance  the market and customer priorities 
in the third quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan that includes a work plan involving focused workforce reductions  including a voluntary retirement program  of approximately  employees  real estate optimization and other cost containment actions such as reductions in information services costs  outsourced services and other discretionary spending across all segments but primarily in carrier packet networks 
we record provisions for workforce reduction costs and exit costs when they are probable and estimable 
severance paid under ongoing benefit arrangements is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for post employment benefits 
one time termination benefits and contract settlement and lease costs are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
at each reporting date  we evaluate our accruals related to workforce reduction charges  contract settlement and lease costs and plant and equipment write downs to ensure that these accruals are still appropriate 
as of december   we had in accruals related to workforce reduction charges and in accruals related to contract settlement and lease costs  which included significant estimates  primarily related to sublease income over the lease terms and other costs for vacated properties 
in certain instances  we may determine that these accruals are no longer required because of efficiencies in carrying out our restructuring work plan 
adjustments to workforce reduction accruals may also be required when employees previously identified for separation do not receive severance payments because they are no longer employed by us or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plan was initiated 
in these cases  we reverse any related accrual to earnings when it is determined it is no longer required 
alternatively  in certain circumstances  we may determine that certain accruals are insufficient as new events occur or as additional information is obtained 
in these cases  we would increase the applicable existing accrual with the offset recorded against earnings 
increase or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified within special charges in the statement of operations 
other contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
as a result  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
we recognize a provision for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are also subject to proceedings  lawsuits  investigations and other claims some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  income and other taxes  environmental  labor  product and other matters which are in the normal course of business 
our restatements of our consolidated financial statements and related events have caused us to be subject to ongoing regulatory and criminal investigations and significant pending civil litigation actions in the us and canada 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in any of these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
on february   we first announced that we had reached a settlement in principle with the lead plaintiffs in two significant class action lawsuits 
as a result of the proposed class action settlement  we have established a litigation reserve and recorded a charge to our full year financial results of   of which relates to the proposed equity component of the proposed class action settlement and will be adjusted in future quarters until the finalization of the settlement based on the market price of the nortel networks corporation common shares issuable

fsp fas r provides an elective alternative transition method  to sfas r  in accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees 
the elective method comprises of a computational component that establishes a beginning balance of the apic pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas r 
the impact on the apic pool of awards partially vested upon  or granted after  the adoption of sfas r should be determined in accordance with the guidance in sfas r

canadian supplement new canadian securities regulations and  as of march   amendments to the regulations under the canada business corporations act  allow issuers that are required to file reports with the sec  upon meeting certain conditions  to satisfy their canadian continuous disclosure obligations by using financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
we have provided the following supplemental information to highlight the significant differences that would have resulted in the md a had it been prepared using canadian gaap information 
the principal continuing reconciling differences that affect consolidated net earnings loss under canadian gaap are derivative accounting  financial instruments and goodwill impairment arising from historical differences in carrying value 
we adopted new canadian accounting standards for asset retirement obligations and for derivatives in and for vies in that are substantially consistent with us gaap 
also in  we elected to expense employee stock based compensation using the fair value based method for us gaap  which has resulted in no significant continuing reconciling difference for stock based compensation under canadian gaap 
other historical differences between us gaap and canadian gaap were primarily due to facts and circumstances related to prior years 
see note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation from u 
s gaap to canadian gaap  including a description of the material differences affecting our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets 
there were no significant differences affecting the consolidated statements of cash flows 
accounting changes under canadian gaap  we adopted the following accounting changes as more fully described in note j of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements determining whether an arrangement contains a lease effective january   we adopted eic  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease eic 
eic provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of cica handbook section  leases 
equivalent guidance in us gaap has already been adopted by us 
the adoption of eic did not have any material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments presentation and disclosure effective january   we adopted amendments to cica handbook section  financial instruments presentation and disclosure section 
the adoption of the amendments to section did not have any material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor in january  the eic issued amended abstract  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
the amendment requires companies to recognize the benefit of non discretionary rebates for achieving specified cumulative purchasing levels as a reduction of the cost of purchases over the relevant period  provided the rebate is probable and reasonably estimable 
otherwise  the rebates would be recognized as purchasing milestones are achieved 
we adopted the amendment effective retroactively for periods commencing on or after february  the adoption of the new amendment did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
derivative accounting effective january   we adopted accounting guideline  hedging relationships  or acg  which establishes specific criteria for derivatives to qualify for hedge accounting 
we had been previously applying these criteria under us gaap  therefore  there was no impact on adoption of acg concurrent with the adoption of acg  we also adopted the cica s emerging issues committee  or eic   accounting for trading  speculative or non hedging derivative financial instruments  or eic as a result of the adoption of eic  certain warrants  which had been previously recorded at cost under canadian gaap  are required to be recorded at fair value consistent with us gaap 
the impact of this accounting change  which has been recorded prospectively as of january   was an increase to investments and other income of during the year ended december  revenue recognition in december  the eic issued abstract  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eic eic was applicable to us beginning january  and was applied prospectively

the application of eic did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
asset retirement obligations under us gaap  we adopted sfas effective january   and recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  within net earnings loss on the date of adoption 
we adopted similar canadian guidance  cica handbook section  asset retirement obligations  effective january   with retroactive restatement of prior periods 
under canadian gaap  the cumulative effect of adoption as of january  was recorded as an adjustment to opening accumulated deficit  as opposed to an adjustment within net earnings loss under us gaap  resulting in a difference of the retroactive adjustment to earnings for the year ended december  and under canadian gaap was not significant 
plant and equipment net  other liabilities and accumulated deficit as of december  have been increased by  and  respectively  to reflect the retroactive restatement 
stock based compensation in november  the cica issued handbook section  stock based compensation and other stock based payments  or section  which was revised in november section outlines a fair value based method of accounting required for certain stock based transactions  effective january   and applied to awards granted on or after that date 
prior to october   as permitted by section  we did not adopt the provisions in respect of the fair value based method of accounting for our employee stock based transactions

restructuring charges under us gaap  effective january   we adopted sfas sfas requires that costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under canadian gaap  eic  accounting for severance and termination benefits  or eic  and eic  accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities including costs incurred in a restructuring  or eic  were issued to harmonize the canadian gaap requirement with sfas effective april   we adopted eic and eic impairment and disposal of long lived assets in may  the cica issued an updated section disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations  or section in april  the cica issued handbook section  impairment of long lived assets  or section the adoption of sections and  which are substantially consistent with us gaap  did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
guarantees in february  the cica issued acg  disclosure of guarantees  or acg acg expands on previously issued accounting guidance and requires additional disclosure by a guarantor of information about each guarantee  or each group of similar guarantees  even when the likelihood of the guarantor having to make any payments under the guarantee is slight 
acg does not address the recognition or measurement of a guarantor s liability for obligations under a guarantee 
we adopted the requirements of acg effective january  which are substantially consistent with the disclosure requirements under us gaap for guarantees 
consolidation of vies in june  the cica issued acg  which is consistent with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
acg clarifies the application of consolidation guidance to those entities defined as vies which includes  but is not limited to  special purpose entities  trusts  partnerships  certain joint ventures and other legal structures in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or there is not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the requirements of acg were effective for all annual and interim periods beginning on or after november  earlier application was encouraged and effective july   we adopted acg at the same time as equivalent guidance under us gaap and prospectively began consolidating two vies for which we were considered the primary beneficiary 
outstanding share data as of april   nortel networks corporation had  outstanding common shares 
as of april    issued and assumed stock options were outstanding and are exercisable for common shares of nortel networks corporation on a one for one basis 
as of april    restricted stock units were outstanding 
once vested  each restricted stock unit entitles the holder to receive one common share of nortel networks corporation  or in our discretion  cash in lieu of common shares in certain circumstances from treasury or through open market purchases at our option 
in addition  nortel networks corporation previously issued us  of convertible senior notes  or senior notes  due on september  the senior notes are convertible  at any time  by holders into common shares of nortel networks corporation  at an initial conversion price of per common share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events including the potential consolidation of nortel networks corporation common shares 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial statements through adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage the risk from these fluctuations  we enter into various derivative hedging transactions that we have authorized under our policies and procedures 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor market risks and counterparty risks 
these systems rely on analytical techniques including both sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
additional disclosure of our financial instruments is included in financial instruments and hedging activities in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
we manage foreign exchange exposures using forward and option contracts to hedge sale and purchase commitments 
our most significant foreign exchange exposures are in the canadian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
we enter into us to canadian dollar forward and option contracts intended to hedge the us to canadian dollar exposure on future revenues and expenditure streams 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we recognize the gains and losses on the effective portion of these contracts in earnings when the hedged transaction occurs 
any ineffective portion of these contracts is recognized in earnings immediately 
we expect to continue to expand our business globally and  as such  expect that an increasing proportion of our business may be denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we try to minimize the impact of such currency fluctuations through our ongoing commercial practices and by attempting to hedge our major currency exposures 
in attempting to manage this foreign exchange risk  we identify operations and transactions that may have exposure based upon the excess or deficiency of foreign currency receipts over foreign currency expenditures 
given our exposure to international markets  we regularly monitor all of our material foreign currency exposures 
our significant currency flows for the year ended december  were in us dollars  canadian dollars  british pounds and euros 
the net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations resulted in gains of in  a gain of in and a gain of in we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange gains or losses in the future 
however  if significant foreign exchange losses are experienced  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our foreign currency risk by computing the potential decrease in cash flows that may result from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the balances are segregated by source currency  and a hypothetical unfavorable variance in foreign exchange rates of is applied to each net source currency position using year end rates  to determine the potential decrease in cash flows over the next year 
the sensitivity analysis includes all foreign currency denominated cash  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments that will impact cash flows over the next year that are held at december  and  respectively 
the underlying cash flows that relate to the hedged firm commitments are not included in the analysis 
the analysis is performed at the reporting date and assumes no future changes in the balances or timing of cash flows from the year end position 
further  the model assumes no correlation in the movement of foreign exchange rates 
based on a one year time horizon  a adverse change in exchange rates would result in a potential decrease in after tax earnings increase in loss of as of december  and would have resulted in a potential decrease in after tax earnings increase in loss of as of december  this potential decrease would result primarily from our exposure to the canadian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
a portion of our long term debt is subject to changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
we have hedged a portion of this exposure to interest rate volatility using fixed for floating interest rate swaps 
the change in fair value of the swaps are recognized in earnings with offsetting amounts related to the change in the fair value of the hedged debt attributable to interest rate changes 
any ineffective portion of the swaps is recognized in income immediately 
we record net settlements on these swap instruments as adjustments to interest expense 
historically  we have managed interest rate exposures  as they relate to interest expense  using a diversified portfolio of fixed and floating rate instruments denominated in several major currencies 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis includes cash  our outstanding floating rate long term debt and any outstanding instruments that convert fixed rate long term debt to floating rate 
a basis point adverse change in interest rates would result in a potential decrease in earnings increase in loss of as of december  and would have resulted in a potential decrease in earnings increase in loss of as of december  equity price risk the values of our equity investments in several publicly traded companies are subject to market price volatility 
these investments are generally in companies in the technology industry sector and are classified as available for sale 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these investment securities 
we also hold certain derivative instruments or warrants that are subject to market price volatility because their value is based on the common share price of a publicly traded company 
these derivative instruments are generally acquired through business acquisitions or divestitures 
in addition  derivative instruments may also be purchased to hedge exposure to certain compensation obligations that vary based on future nortel networks corporation common share prices 
we do not hold equity securities or derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities and the related underlying stock prices of publicly traded equity securities for certain of our derivative instruments would result in a loss in their aggregate fair value of as of december   a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities and the related underlying stock prices of publicly traded equity securities for certain of our derivative instruments would have resulted in a loss in their aggregate fair value of this includes a loss of related to derivative instruments that were purchased to hedge exposure to compensation obligations 
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations in various jurisdictions around the world  primarily due to our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are exposed to liabilities and compliance costs arising from our past and current generation  management and disposition of hazardous substances and wastes 
we have remedial activities under way at of our facilities which are either currently occupied or were previously owned or occupied 
we have also been listed as a potentially responsible party at four superfund sites in the us an estimate of our anticipated remediation costs associated with all such facilities and sites  to the extent probable and reasonably estimable  is included in our environmental accruals in an approximate amount of for a discussion of environmental matters  see contingencies in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements
