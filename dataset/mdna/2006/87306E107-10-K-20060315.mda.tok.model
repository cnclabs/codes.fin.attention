table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations  estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and forward looking information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview corporate history we were formerly a texas corporation named industrial holdings  inc  or ihi  which was a public company with its common stock traded on the nasdaq national market 
our predecessor  t energy services  inc  or former t  was incorporated in delaware in october former t began operations in the first half of by acquiring and merging with cor val  inc and preferred industries  inc 
in december  former t merged into ihi  with ihi as the surviving entity 
immediately after the merger  the combined company was reincorporated in delaware under the name t energy services  inc  and the combined company completed a one for ten reverse split of its common stock 
our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the symbol ttes on the day after the merger 
as part of the merger ihi divested substantially all of its non energy related subsidiaries  ihi stockholders converted million of ihi debt into shares of ihi common stock  first reserve fund viii converted million of former t debt into shares of former t common stock  and first reserve fund viii purchased an additional million of shares of former t common stock 
from inception until the merger  former t completed five acquisitions for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and the issuance of shares of former t common stock 
the cash portion of all of these acquisitions was financed through sales of former t common stock to first reserve fund viii and debt financing provided by the sellers or third parties 
during october  we acquired oilco for approximately million  through which we entered the canadian market  acquired complementary pressure control products and expanded our product offerings to include elastomers 
during july  we expanded into mexico by entering into a joint participation agreement with servicios y maquinaria de mexico  sa de sa  or symmsa  a subsidiary of grupo r  a conglomerate of companies that provides services to the energy and industrial sectors in mexico 
we historically operated in three segments  which were pressure control  distribution and products 
however  in a series of transactions described below between the first quarter of and october   we sold substantially all of the assets of our products and distribution businesses 
in  we sold our non core fastener businesses for approximately million  sold the remaining assets of our products segment  except for certain assets related to our custom coatings business  along with certain assets of our pressure control business  for approximately million  and sold certain assets of the spray weld division of o m equipment  lp for approximately million 

table of contents in october  we sold our distribution business for a purchase price of approximately million  which purchase price was subsequently reduced by million pursuant to a post closing adjustment 
as a result of these dispositions  our focus now is on our pressure control business  which is our only remaining reporting segment 
the sale of our products and distribution segments constituted sales of businesses 
our results of operations for our distribution and products segments have been reported as discontinued operations in the periods presented 
in january  we completed the purchase of kc machine llc  located in rock springs  wyoming to continue to expand our pressure and flow control  wellhead and pipeline products and services to those existing and new customers who are located in the rocky mountain region 
in addition  also in january  we also expanded into the east texas region by opening a facility to provide wellhead and pipeline products  repairs and field services for companies whose operations are actively involved in the cotton valley  barnett shale and austin chalk fields 
see business recent developments 
evaluation of strategic alternatives we were capitalized by first reserve fund viii  a private equity fund and our majority stockholder  in first reserve fund viii made subsequent equity investments of million in december and million in march in march  with the approval of our board of directors  representatives of first reserve fund viii contacted simmons company international in connection with a possible engagement in which it would assist us in exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives designed to enhance stockholder value 
in april  we engaged simmons as a financial advisor for that purpose 
simmons conducted a review of our existing business and opportunities  and evaluated our relative strengths and challenges 
following the review  our board of directors decided to market the entire company for sale and to also consider offers for our distribution business on a stand alone basis 
simmons began marketing our distribution business in late may and the entire company in june simmons contacted a number of potential acquirers regarding the sale of t and the distribution business 
in october  based on the results of the marketing process  our board of directors concluded that retaining and expanding the pressure control business was in the best interest of t and its stockholders  and subsequently terminated the engagement with simmons 
as for the sale of the distribution business  we received four written indications of interest for the distribution business 
one of these indications of interest resulted in the sale of the distribution business in october how we generate our revenue we design  manufacture  repair and service products used in the drilling and completion of new oil and gas wells  the workover of existing wells  and the production and transportation of oil and gas 
our products are used in both onshore and offshore applications 
our customer base  which operates in active oil and gas basins throughout the world  consists of leading drilling contractors  exploration and production companies and pipeline companies 
we have three product lines within our pressure control reporting segment 
those product lines are pressure and flow control  wellhead and pipeline 
within each of those product lines  we sell new products and also provide aftermarket parts and services 
new products are those we manufacture or have manufactured for us by others who use our new product designs 
aftermarket products and services include all remanufactured products and parts and repair and field services 
demand for our pressure and flow control and wellhead products and services is driven by exploration and development activity levels  which in turn are directly related to current and anticipated oil and gas prices 
demand for our pipeline products and services is driven by maintenance  repair and construction activities for pipeline  gathering and transmission systems 

table of contents we typically bid for new product sales and repair work 
field service work is offered at a fixed rate plus expenses 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses the following financial and operational measurements to analyze the performance of our products and services revenue and facility output  material and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  ebitda  and financial and operational models 
revenue and facility output we monitor our revenue and facility output and analyze trends to determine the relative performance of each of our facilities 
our analysis enables us to more efficiently operate our facilities and determine if we need to refine our processes and procedures at any one location to improve operational efficiency 
material and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue material and labor expenses are composed primarily of cost of materials  labor costs and the indirect costs associated with our products and services 
with the exception of costs of materials used in our products  the cost of these expenses as a percentage of revenue has historically remained relatively stable 
our material costs primarily include the cost of inventory consumed in the manufacturing and remanufacturing of our products and in providing repair services 
increases in our material costs are frequently passed on to our customers 
however  due to the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles  there generally is a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur an actual price increase until the time that we can pass on that increase to our customers 
our labor costs consist primarily of wages at our facilities 
as a result of increased activity in the oil and gas industry  there have been recent shortages of qualified machinists at some of our facilities 
we may have to raise wage rates to attract and train workers to expand our current work force 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  expenses  include administrative and marketing costs  the costs of employee compensation and related benefits  office and lease expenses  insurance costs and professional fees  as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to our operations 
our management continually evaluates the level of our sg a expenses in relation to our revenue because these expenses have a direct impact on our profitability 
we believe that our sg a expenses will increase in due to costs of complying with the sarbanes oxley act 
ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before interest expense  net of interest income  provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of operating performance that assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis because it removes the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results  as a measure for budgeting and for evaluating actual results against our budgets  to assess compliance with financial ratios and covenants included in our senior credit facility  
table of contents in communications with lenders concerning our financial performance  and to evaluate the viability of potential acquisitions and overall rates of return 
financial and operational models we couple our evaluation of financial data with performance data that tracks financial losses due to safety incidents  product warranty and quality control  customer satisfaction  employee productivity  and management system compliance 
the information is collected in a proprietary statistical tracking program that automatically compiles and statistically analyzes real time trends 
this information helps us ensure that each of our facilities improves with respect to customer and market demands 
loss management 
we incur operational losses from employee injuries  product warranty claims and quality control costs 
we track both incident rates and costs 
we also track quality control and warranty expenses through specialized software 
all direct expenses incurred due to warranty  quality control and safety incidents are statistically analyzed as a percentage of sales 
customer satisfaction 
we monitor our customers level of satisfaction regarding our delivery  product quality  and service through customer surveys and other data collection methods 
all information collected from the customer satisfaction assessments are statistically compiled to track annual performance 
all customer complaints are processed through a corrective action program 
employee productivity 
we have increased employee training 
each of our facilities is provided a benchmark under which its employees are evaluated through a collection of practical examinations  written examinations  presentations and in house training videos 
as the collected information is evaluated  deficiencies are identified and corrective actions are assessed 
management system compliance 
we currently use four management programs designed to consistently manage all aspects of our operations at each facility  while providing useful tools to limit operational liabilities and improve profitability 
these programs incorporate various performance standards that are useful in the evaluation of operational performance in the pursuit of continual improvement 
compliance with the standards set forth in those programs is evaluated several times a year through a combination of customer audits  third party audits and internal audits 
each facility s compliance with the standards is then evaluated and all deficiencies identified are analyzed and corrective actions assessed 
corrective actions at each facility are used to implement preventative action at the remaining facilities 
how we manage our operations our management team uses a variety of tools to monitor and manage our operations  including safety and environmental management systems  quality management systems  statistical tracking systems  and inventory turnover rates 
safety and environmental management systems our safety management system  or sms  monitors our training program as it relates to osha compliance 
through a collection of regulatory audits and internal audits  we can evaluate each facility s compliance with regulatory requirements and take corrective actions necessary to ensure compliance 
we also use our sms to ensure that employee training is conducted on a regular basis 
several employee qualification programs are managed from our sms to ensure that our employees perform their duties as safely as possible 
all employees are individually evaluated with respect to their safety performance  and these evaluations are incorporated into all annual employee reviews 

table of contents similar to the sms  our environmental management system monitors compliance with environmental laws 
each of our facilities is continually evaluated against collected data to identify possible deficiencies 
quality management systems all processes  employee certification programs  and inspection activities are managed through our quality management systems  or qms 
our qms is based on several industrial standards and is coupled with performance models to ensure continual monitoring and improvement of the program 
each of our facilities has a quality management team that is charged with assuring that day to day operations are conducted consistently and within the protocols outlined in the qms 
operational steps continually are monitored and evaluated against customer and industrial requirements 
to ensure that all qms elements are operating as designed and to provide an addition level of support at each facility  we have assigned a quality director at each facility who monitors individual facility performance and helps manage critical operations 
statistical tracking systems we have developed a statistical tracking program that assists in the real time compilation of data from each facility and then automatically assesses the data through various data analysis tools 
facility managers and operational executives are provided summary reports  providing information about their performance and how it compares to industrial and internal benchmarks 
inventory turnover rates the cost of our material inventory represents a significant portion of our cost of revenue from our product lines 
as a result  maintaining an optimum level of inventory at each of our facilities in an important factor in managing our operations 
we continually monitor the inventory turnover rates for each of our product lines and adjusts the frequency of inventory orders as appropriate to maintain the optimum level of inventory based on activity level for each product line 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k beginning on page f the accounting policies we believe to be the most critical to our reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition 
our products and services are sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do not include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post delivery obligations 
we record revenue at the time the customer has been provided with all proper inspection and other required documentation  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and the product has been delivered 
customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when we have completed all of our performance obligations related to the sale 
we also recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the related contract provisions 
the amounts billed for shipping and handling cost are included in revenue and related costs are included in costs of sales 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount  net of write offs and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our receivables are exposed to concentrations of credit risk since a majority of our business is conducted with companies in the oil and gas  petrochemical  chemical and petroleum refining industries in the gulf coast region and canada 
we continually monitor collections and evaluate the financial strength of our customers but do not require collateral to support our domestic customer receivables 
we may require collateral to support our international customer receivables  if any 
we provide an allowance for doubtful 
table of contents accounts for potential collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is no longer probable 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past or that our losses will not exceed the amount reserved 
inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and slow moving inventory to write down the recorded cost of inventory to its fair market value 
this analysis is based primarily on the length of time the item has remained in inventory and management s consideration of current and expected market conditions 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if these impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the undiscounted cash flow analysis consists of estimating the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over its remaining useful life 
these cash flows are inherently subjective and require significant estimates based upon historical experience and future expectations reflected in our budgets and internal projections 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the long lived asset  an impairment has occurred  and we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
no significant impairments occurred for assets of continuing operations for the years ended december   and goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and represents a significant portion of our assets 
identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon fair market value at the date of acquisition 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard changed the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
the standard also requires a reassessment of the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and at least an annual test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives 
our annual tests of impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are performed as of december the fair values of our reporting units are determined based on each reporting unit s projected discounted cash flow and publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples of comparable businesses 
during  and  we completed the annual impairment tests required by sfas no 
our annual impairment calculations for and indicated the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill and indefinite life intangibles were not impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a formal plan to sell certain non core assets within our products segment 
at december   the assets held for sale constituted a business and thus were classified as discontinued operations 
goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
for the year ended december   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to the disposal of these assets 
in connection with the disposition of these non core assets  we re evaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of our products segment for and concluded that the segment would continue to contribute positively to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows but at a much reduced level 
this determination took into account softness in the gulf of mexico upstream and downstream oil and gas industry as well as lower revenues generated from larger fabricated equipment and component sales 
in addition  we expected lower revenues from our electrical motor and generator repair and storage business 

table of contents accordingly  at december   we assessed the realizability of our recorded goodwill and other intangibles under sfas no 
our analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired for the remaining businesses within the products segment 
we then performed a discounted cash flow analysis and used other market methods to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill and intangibles 
this assessment indicated that goodwill of million  of which million was attributable to our custom coatings business  was impaired 
during the second quarter of  we again re evaluated our expectations for the earnings  growth and contribution of the products segment 
as part of this re evaluation  we decided to sell substantially all of the remaining assets within our products segment  except for certain assets related to our custom coatings business  along with certain assets within our pressure control segment 
at june   pressure control goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
this resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million in discontinued operations during the second quarter of  related to the assets being sold within our pressure control segment 
on october   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our distribution segment 
this resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million in discontinued operations during in connection with the disposition of the distribution segment  we reviewed our presentation of segment information and concluded that we have one remaining reporting segment  pressure control 
this segment classification is based on aggregation criteria defined in sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we now evaluate the operating results of our pressure control reporting segment based upon its three product lines pressure and flow control  wellhead and pipeline 
our operating segments of pressure and flow control  wellhead and pipeline have been aggregated into one reporting segment as the operating segments have the following commonalities economic characteristics  nature of the products and services  type or class of customer  and methods used to distribute their products and provide services 
accordingly  we have reevaluated our reporting units under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets based upon these three operating segments 
due to this reevaluation of reporting units  we assessed the realizability of our recorded goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
at september  goodwill was thus allocated based on the relative fair values of the three reporting units and then assessed for impairment 
our analysis indicated that goodwill was not impaired as the fair value of our reporting units was greater than carrying value 
self insurance 
we are self insured up to certain levels for our group medical coverage 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured  up to a limit 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  projections of future losses are inherently uncertain  and it is possible that our estimates of these liabilities may change over the near term as circumstances develop 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million during on a million loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the write off of non deductible goodwill and the effect of non deductible expenses 
we operate in several domestic tax jurisdictions and certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
as a result  we are subject to domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we must pay during any given year 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future 
table of contents deductibility is not probable 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all reasonably available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions  including the amount of future state  federal and international pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
when the likelihood of the realization of existing deferred tax assets changes  adjustments to the valuation allowance are charged  in the period in which the determination is made  either to income or goodwill  depending upon when that portion of the valuation allowance was originally created 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million offset by a valuation allowance of million 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  we plan to adopt the provisions of the new standard effective january  as a result of adoption and the  stock options granted in january  we expect to recognize approximately million of additional pre tax expense in 
table of contents outlook changes in the current and expected future prices of oil and gas influence the level of energy industry spending 
changes in spending result in an increase or decrease in demand for our products and services 
therefore  our results are dependant on  among other things  the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling activity  capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors and pipeline maintenance activity 
key industry indicators for the years ending december   and include the following change change active drilling rigs v v u

we believe our outlook for is favorable  as overall activity in the markets we operate in is expected to remain high and the company s backlog  especially for our pressure and flow control business  began to increase significantly in the third quarter of we expect that the high levels of drilling activity in north america and the increased demand for our products to be shipped internationally will continue to drive significant levels of backlog 
over the next twelve months  we plan to significantly expand our manufacturing capacity through facility expansions and operational improvements  through several selected geographical expansions and the continued introduction of new products being developed by our engineering group  which has more than doubled in size since mid we believe this expansion will allow us to continue and improve our already rapid response time to customer demands and enable us to build market share worldwide 
looking into and beyond  we expect average rig activity to remain at high levels  and we expect our new products sales to increase compared to levels due to our product acceptance by the industry  new product introductions  significant capital and geographical expansions and continued rapid response time to customers 
the company s actual results will also be dependent on the pace and level of activities in the markets served by the company 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the oilco acquisition  which was completed during the fourth quarter of  accounted for of this increase 
the remaining increase is attributable to improved demand for our other products and services resulting from higher price levels for oil and natural gas and correspondingly higher levels of construction of drilling rigs that require the type of equipment we manufacture 
we also believe that our new products  together with the t brand  have gained market acceptance  resulting in greater sales to customers that use our products both domestically and in international operations 
for example  bop and bop control systems shipments have increased and  respectively  in as compared to cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the increase in revenues described above 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  gross profit margin was higher in primarily due to improved pricing and increased market share  partially offset by down time caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
also  gross profit margins for were negatively impacted due to increased product modification and development expenses during operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues described above 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is due to operating expenses consisting primarily of fixed costs with a higher sales volume  partially offset by increased regulatory requirements costs  consulting costs  professional fees of million related to the terminated public offering and down time caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
operating expenses for the pressure control segment increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues described above 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  this decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is due to operating expenses consisting primarily of fixed costs with a higher sales volume  partially offset by down time caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
operating expenses for corporate operations increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased regulatory requirements costs  consulting costs and professional fees of million related to the terminated public offering 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to repaying our subordinated term loan during may income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes 
the effective tax rate was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  the higher tax rate in the period resulted from increased state income taxes during as compared to also  the period included a larger reduction of the valuation allowance which reduced income tax expense as compared to income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations was million in the year ended december  compared with million in the year ended december  as a result of the foregoing factors 

table of contents discontinued operations 
during and  we sold substantially all of the assets of our distribution and products segments  respectively 
these assets constituted businesses and thus their results of operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in loss is primarily attributable to the pre tax loss of million for the sale of the distribution segment during  as compared to a loss of million for the sale of a portion of the products segment during year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  although united states drilling activity increased from year to year and oil and gas prices increased  revenues declined primarily as a result of softness in the gulf of mexico drilling rig count and increased pricing pressure for substantially all of our products and services 
this decrease was offset by increased revenues from certain pressure control products and services resulting from an improved united states onshore rig count and the purchase of oilco during the fourth quarter of cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in revenues described above 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  gross profit margin was higher during due to cost reduction strategies  including lower self insured medical costs and slightly improved margins from some of our products and services resulting from an improved united states onshore rig count 
this was partially offset by pricing pressure on other products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses were in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  operating expenses decreased primarily due to cost reduction strategies  including lower self insured medical costs and personnel reductions  and a million goodwill impairment charge during related to our custom coatings business 
this decrease was partially offset by expenses associated with the growth and improvement of our engineering and technical sales support group and the purchase of oilco during operating expenses for our pressure control segment decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of lower self insured medical costs during and a goodwill impairment of million during this decrease in was partially offset by the write off of million relating to other intangible assets associated with the disposition of certain spray welding assets  expenses associated with the growth and improvement of our engineering and technical sales support division  and the purchase of oilco during operating expenses for corporate operations decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to cost reduction strategies and personnel reductions  offset partially by increased external reporting costs and consulting fees 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily as a result of lower debt levels and interest rates during write off of acquired note receivable 
in the year ended december   we wrote off a million note receivable that was acquired in conjunction with the disposal by ihi of beaird industries  inc before the completion of ihi s merger with former t during  we were informed by the payor of the note of its inability to make payments and that its refinancing efforts had been unsuccessful 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  in  the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease 
table of contents in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  and state income taxes  net of the federal benefit provided  partially offset by the effect of non deductible expenses 
income tax expense was million in even though we had a loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes of million 
this was primarily due to the write off of non deductible goodwill and the effect of non deductible expenses 
income loss from continuing operations
