item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review risk factors beginning on page r of this report and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements above for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f the notes contain essential information and the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this section of the report 
critical accounting policies we discuss below accounting policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require management to make complex judgments and or assessments of risks 
information regarding certain other accounting policies is included in the notes to the company s financial statements 
long lived assets 
hotels are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we review our hotels on an annual basis for impairment 
we also determine on a quarterly basis if any events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the value of the assets on our books may not be fully recoverable 
the company reviewed each of its hotels at december  for impairment and  based on its estimate of each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  determined that no impairment existed at any of its hotels 
in determining each hotel s future undiscounted cash flows  we made many assumptions and estimates  including the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holding periods of the hotels  expected remaining useful lives of the hotels  and fair value of the hotel upon disposition  if appropriate 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded an impairment charge on two of the three hotels that were held for sale at december  in the amount of million  and in the fourth quarter of we recorded an additional impairment charge on two of the three hotels that were held for sale at december  in the amount of  the impairment charges were based on valuing the hotels at the expected proceeds to be realized upon a sale less any closing costs 
if the company s estimate of the future cash flows of one or more of its hotels were to decrease in future periods  the company may be required to recognize further impairment charges in such periods and the impairment charges may be significant 
income taxes 
the trss have cumulative future income tax deductions of  at december  and the gross deferred tax asset associated with these future tax deductions was  the trss have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of the gross deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of this asset 
the trss considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the trss were to determine that it could realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset in the future  the trss would record a reduction in the valuation allowance and recognize a deferred income tax benefit in the same amount

the company has no interest rate hedging instrument exposure  financial derivatives or forward equity commitments 
capital expenditures the percentage leases with the trss generally require the company to make available an amount equal to or of room revenues from the hotels  per month on a cumulative basis  for the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment and certain other capital expenditures at the hotels 
each of the company s term loans require that the company make available for such purposes  at the hotels collateralizing those loans  amounts up to of gross revenues from such hotels 
the company intends to cause 
table of contents the expenditure of amounts in excess of such obligated amounts  if necessary  to comply with the reasonable requirements of any franchise agreement and otherwise to the extent that the company deems such expenditures to be in the best interests of the company 
see business narrative description of business internal growth strategy capital improvements  renovation and refurbishment under item above 
management believes that the amounts required to be made available by the company under the percentage leases will be sufficient to meet most of the routine expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels 
however  in the past  the company has spent substantially more on capital expenditures than the percentage leases require 
management believed these additional expenditures were necessary to meet competitive pressures from other hotels  many of which are newly constructed 
in many cases  the expenditures were also required by franchisors of the hotels 
management believes that for the foreseeable future the company will continue to spend substantially more on capital expenditures than it is required to make available to the trss under the percentage leases or loan agreements 
the extent to which the actual expenditures exceed the amounts required to be made available will vary from year to year  based on a number of factors 
those factors include  for any given year  market and franchisor requirements  the point in the normal recurring upgrade cycle the hotels are at in that year  and the revenue of the hotels for that year 
in  management expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  excluding acquisition  conversion  and development costs 
to the extent that the company spends more on capital expenditures than is available from the company s operations  the company intends to fund capital expenditures with available cash and borrowings under the line of credit 
related party transactions the company has entered into a number of transactions and arrangements that involve conflicts of interest

minimum annual rent payable under these leases is approximately  in the aggregate  subject to increase based on increases in the consumer price index 
the company has executed  in purchase orders and other construction contracts for completion in the trss have obligations under the franchise licenses for each of its hotels 
the trss are required to pay the franchisors a variety of fees  including franchise and marketing fees which are based on fixed percentages of room revenues 
the trss are also required to pay marriott the conversion fee and potential incentive fee 
see notes and to the company s financial statements beginning on page f 
table of contents see properties the management agreements with the ih manager under item above 
with respect to seven hotels  if the company were to sell those hotels in taxable transactions before november   the company would become liable for certain tax liabilities incurred by sellers who exchanged interests in those hotels for class b preferred units when the company acquired the hotels 
however  we cannot predict whether  when or to what extent the company may incur liability under these indemnifications 
seasonality of hotel business the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
historically  the hotels operations have generally reflected higher occupancy rates and adr during the second and third quarters 
to the extent that cash flow for a quarter is insufficient to fund all of the hotel operating expenses and distributions for such quarter due to seasonal and other factors  the company may fund quarterly hotel operating expenses and distributions with available cash and borrowings under the line of credit 
inflation operators of hotels  including the ih manager  generally possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures and other factors have limited and may in the future limit the ability of the ih manager to raise room rates in response to inflation 
there can be no assurance that recent modest inflation levels will not increase in future years or that the effects of inflation can be offset by raising hotel room rates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for fas r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of fas r will be effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the company tentatively expects to adopt the provision of fas r using a modified prospective application 
fas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation among other charges  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma purpose under fas the company will adopt fas r and it will be effective for the first quarter of fiscal year the company believes the pro forma disclosures in note share based compensation provide an appropriate indicator of the level of expense that will be recognized in accordance with fas r 
however  the total expense recorded in future periods will depend on several variables  including the number of share based awards that are granted and the fair value of those awards 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 account changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas will become effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal year the adoption of this statement is not expected to affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  fin was issued to clarify that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably 
table of contents estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company determined that fin had no impact as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its line of credit and other debt 
at december   the company had total outstanding indebtedness of  the company s interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps and treasury options or locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
currently  the company has no derivative financial instruments 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the following table presents principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands there after total fair value debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate for purposes of disclosure  the company calculates the fair value of its debt 
the company discounts the difference between the future contractual interest payments on its debt and the future interest payments it would make on its debt calculated using a current market interest rate 
in determining the current market interest rate  the company adds its estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with maturities similar to its debt 
an increase of one percent in the interest rate on the company s variable rate debt would have increased interest expense approximately  in the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the future period  prevailing interest rates  and the company s hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements 
at december   the company s line of credit  had an outstanding balance of  the line of credit matures in july all of our other debt matures in or thereafter
