item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are engaged primarily in the business of developing and constructing  and then owning and operating  a network of three onshore lng receiving terminals  and related natural gas pipelines  along the gulf coast of the united states 
we are also engaged  to a limited extent  in oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in the gulf of mexico 
we operate four business activities lng receiving terminal development  natural gas pipeline development  lng and natural gas marketing and oil and gas exploration and development 
at this stage in our development  our operations are divided into two reporting segments in our financial statements lng receiving terminal development and oil and gas exploration and development 
lng receiving terminal development business we have focused our development efforts on three  owned lng receiving terminal projects at the following locations sabine pass lng in western cameron parish  louisiana on the sabine pass channel  corpus christi lng near corpus christi  texas  and creole trail lng at the mouth of the calcasieu channel in central cameron parish  louisiana 
in addition  we own a interest in a fourth project  freeport lng  located on quintana island near freeport  texas 
our three terminals have an aggregate designed regasification capacity of approximately bcf d  subject to expansion 
we have entered into long term tuas with total and chevron usa for an aggregate of bcf d of the available regasification capacity  and we anticipate retaining a portion of regasification capacity for our own use 
construction of phase of our sabine pass lng receiving terminal commenced in march  and we anticipate commencing operations at the terminal in construction of the corpus christi and creole trail lng receiving terminals is anticipated to commence in and  respectively  and we anticipate commencing operations at the facilities in and  respectively 
natural gas pipeline development business we anticipate developing natural gas pipelines from each of our three lng receiving terminals to provide optimal access to north american natural gas markets 
development efforts to date have focused primarily on advancing our pipeline projects through the regulatory review and authorization process 
recently  our development efforts have also included the construction and operation of our proposed natural gas pipelines 
we anticipate commencing construction of our sabine pass pipeline in early and that it will be operational in the fourth quarter of lng and natural gas marketing business our lng and natural gas marketing business is in its early stages of development 
utilizing a portion of our planned lng receiving terminal regasification capacity that we intend to reserve for use by cheniere marketing at our three lng receiving terminals  we intend to purchase lng from foreign suppliers  arrange transportation of lng to our network of lng receiving terminals  arrange the transportation of revaporized natural gas through our pipelines and other interconnected pipelines and sell natural gas to buyers in the north american market 
in addition  we also expect to enter into domestic natural gas purchase and sale transactions as part of our marketing activities 
oil and gas exploration and development business although our focus is primarily on the development of lng related businesses  we continue to be involved to a limited extent in oil and gas exploration  development and exploitation  and in exploitation of our existing d seismic database through prospect generation 
we have historically focused on evaluating and generating 
table of contents drilling prospects using a regional and integrated approach with a large seismic database as a platform 
our current oil and gas exploration and development activities are focused on the cameron project and the offshore texas project area 
from time to time  we will invest in drilling a share of these prospects and may pursue opportunities in other geographic locations as well 
liquidity and capital resources we are primarily engaged in lng related business activities 
our three lng terminal projects  as well as our proposed pipelines  will require significant amounts of capital and are subject to risks and delays in completion 
in addition  our marketing business will need a substantial amount of capital for hiring employees  satisfying creditworthiness requirements of contracts and developing the systems necessary to implement our business strategy 
even if successfully completed and implemented  our lng related business activities are not expected to begin to operate and generate significant cash flows before as a result  our business success will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to obtain the funding necessary to construct our three lng terminals and related pipelines  to bring them into operation on a commercially viable basis and to finance the costs of staffing  operating and expanding our company during that process 
we currently estimate that the cost of completing our three lng receiving terminals will be approximately billion  before financing costs 
in addition  we expect that capital expenditures of approximately million to billion will be required to construct our three proposed pipelines 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
while we believe that we have adequate financial resources available to us through  we must augment our existing sources of cash with significant additional funds in order to carry out our long term business plan 
we currently expect that our capital requirements will be financed in part through cash on hand  issuances of project level debt  equity or a combination of the two and in part with net proceeds of debt or equity securities issued by cheniere or other cheniere borrowings 
our lng receiving terminals sabine pass lng we currently estimate that the cost of constructing phase of the sabine pass lng facility will be approximately million to million  before financing costs  which will be funded as described below 
phase of the sabine pass lng facility may be constructed in stages 
the first stage is estimated to cost approximately million to million  before financing costs 
we are currently evaluating funding alternatives for the first stage of construction of phase of the sabine pass lng facility  which may include existing cash balances  proceeds from debt or equity offerings  or a combination thereof 
the second stage of constructing phase of the sabine pass lng facility is still under evaluation 
sabine pass credit facility in february  sabine pass lng entered into the million sabine pass credit facility with an initial syndicate of financial institutions 
soci t g n rale serves as the administrative agent and hsbc serves as collateral agent 
the sabine pass credit facility will be used to fund a substantial majority of the costs of constructing and placing into operation phase of the sabine pass lng receiving terminal 
unless sabine pass lng decides to terminate availability earlier  the sabine pass credit facility will be available until no later than april   after which time any unutilized portion of the sabine pass credit facility will be permanently canceled 
before sabine pass lng could make an initial borrowing under the sabine pass credit facility  it was required to provide evidence that it had received equity contributions in amounts sufficient to fund million of the project costs 
as of december   the million equity contributions had been funded and  as a result  we began drawing under the sabine pass credit facility in january as of february   million had been drawn under the sabine pass credit facility 
in addition  we made a million subordinated loan to sabine pass lng in late 
table of contents borrowings under the sabine pass credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin varies from to during the term of the sabine pass credit facility 
the sabine pass credit facility provides for a commitment fee of per annum on the daily committed  undrawn portion of the sabine pass credit facility 
administrative fees must also be paid annually to the agent and the collateral agent 
the principal of loans made under the sabine pass credit facility must be repaid in semi annual installments commencing six months after the later of i the date that substantial completion of the project occurs under the epc agreement and ii the commercial start date under the total tua 
sabine pass lng may specify an earlier date to commence repayment upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
in any event  payments under the sabine pass credit facility must commence no later than october   and all obligations under the sabine pass credit facility mature and must be fully repaid by february  under the terms and conditions of the sabine pass credit facility  all cash held by sabine pass lng is controlled by the collateral agent 
these funds can only be released by the collateral agent upon receipt of satisfactory documentation that the sabine pass lng project costs are bona fide expenditures and are permitted under the terms of the sabine pass credit facility 
the sabine pass credit facility does not permit sabine pass lng to hold any cash  or cash equivalents  outside of the accounts established under the agreement 
because these cash accounts are controlled by the collateral agent  the sabine pass lng cash balance of million held in these accounts as of december  is classified as restricted on our balance sheet 
the sabine pass credit facility contains customary conditions precedent to the initial borrowing and any subsequent borrowings  as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants 
sabine pass lng has obtained  and may in the future seek  consents  waivers and amendments to the sabine pass credit facility documents 
the obligations of sabine pass lng under the sabine pass credit facility are secured by all of sabine pass lng s personal property  including the total and chevron usa tuas and the partnership interests in sabine pass lng 
in connection with the closing of the sabine pass credit facility  sabine pass lng entered into swap agreements with hsbc and soci t g n rale 
under the terms of the swap agreements  sabine pass lng will be able to hedge against rising interest rates  to a certain extent  with respect to its drawings under the sabine pass credit facility up to a maximum amount of million 
the swap agreements have the effect of fixing the libor component of the interest rate payable under the sabine pass credit facility with respect to hedged drawings under the sabine pass credit facility up to a maximum of million at from july  to march  and at from march  through march  the final termination date of the swap agreements will be march  epc agreement sabine pass lng issued an ntp in early april  which required bechtel to commence all other aspects of the work under the epc agreement

this contract price is subject to adjustment for changes in certain commodity prices  contingencies  change orders and other items 
payments under the epc agreement will be made in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the epc agreement 
the contract price and payment schedule  including milestones  may be amended only by change order 
bechtel will be liable to sabine pass lng for certain delays in achieving substantial completion  minimum acceptance criteria and performance guarantees 
bechtel will be entitled to a scheduled bonus of million  or a lesser amount in certain cases  if on or before april   bechtel completes construction sufficient to achieve  among other requirements specified in the epc agreement  a sendout rate of at least bcf d for a minimum sustained test period of hours 
bechtel will be entitled to receive an additional bonus of  per day up to a maximum of million for each day that commercial operation is achieved prior to april  as of february   change orders for million were approved  thereby increasing the total contract price to million 
we anticipate additional change orders intended to mitigate ongoing effects of the 
table of contents hurricanes that would increase the contract price by an amount not expected to exceed million 
we expect to submit any such change orders to our lenders by may  for approval under the sabine pass credit facility 
bechtel has claimed events of force majeure arising out of three hurricanes in along the us gulf coast 
sabine pass lng is currently in negotiations with bechtel and certain subcontractors concerning additional activities and expenditures in order  among other things  to attract sufficient skilled labor to mitigate potential schedule delays and provide a reasonable opportunity for bechtel to attain the initial target bonus date of april  as part of these negotiations  we have agreed in principle to defer the date by which substantial completion of the entire project is required to be accomplished under the epc contract from september to december  in the absence of substantial completion by such date  bechtel would be obligated to pay us certain liquidated damages as provided under the terms of the contract 
we expect that the above described arrangement will not exceed million  although such amount is subject to change  requires approval of the lenders under our sabine pass credit facility and requires that a change order be agreed upon with bechtel 
customer tuas total has paid sabine pass lng nonrefundable advance capacity reservation fees of million in the aggregate million in each of and in connection with the reservation under a year tua with extension options of approximately bcf d of lng regasification capacity at the sabine pass lng receiving terminal

corpus christi lng we currently estimate that the cost of constructing the corpus christi lng facility will be approximately million to million  before financing costs 
this estimate is based in part on our negotiations with a major international epc contractor

bpu lng was required to fund of the first million of corpus christi lng s expenditures  which amount was funded as of march  from that date until february   when we acquired bpu lng s interest  we funded of the expenditures of corpus christi lng  with bpu lng funding the balance 
since february   bpu lng has not been required to fund any expenditures  and as the sole owner of corpus christi lng  we are now required to fund of expenditures 
we expect to begin site preparation and detailed engineering work in the second quarter of and to commence operations at the corpus christi lng receiving terminal in early we currently expect to fund the project costs for our corpus christi lng receiving terminal from cash balances  project financing similar to that used for our sabine pass lng facility  proceeds from debt or equity offerings  or a combination thereof 
if these types of financing are not available  we will be required to seek alternative sources of financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all

if these types of financing are not available  we will be required to seek alternative sources of financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
other lng interests we have a limited partner interest in freeport lng 
under the limited partnership agreement of freeport lng  development expenses of the freeport lng project and other freeport lng cash needs generally are to be funded out of freeport lng s own cash flows  borrowings or other sources  and  up to a pre agreed total amount  with capital contributions by the limited partners 
in july  freeport lng entered into a credit agreement with conocophillips to provide a substantial majority of the debt financing 
we received capital calls  and made capital contributions  in the amount of approximately million in in december  freeport lng announced that it had closed a million private placement of notes  which will be used to fund the remaining portion of the initial phase of the project  a portion of the cost of expanding the lng receiving terminal and the development of bcf of underground salt cavern gas storage 
as a result of such financing being obtained  we do not anticipate that any capital calls will be made upon the limited partners of freeport lng in the foreseeable future 
although no capital calls are currently outstanding  and we do not anticipate any in the foreseeable future  additional capital calls may be made upon us and the other limited partners in freeport lng 
in the event of each such future capital call  we will have the option either to contribute the requested capital or to decline to contribute 
if we decline to contribute  the other limited partners could elect to make our contribution and receive back twice the amount contributed on our behalf  without interest  before any freeport lng cash flows are otherwise distributed to us

this epc pipeline contract  among other things  provides for a guaranteed maximum price of approximately million  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  as provided in the contract 
we estimate that the total cost to construct the pipeline  including certain work not included in the epc pipeline contract  such as interconnection with third party pipelines  will be approximately million 
our total cost estimate is preliminary and subject to change due to such items as cost overruns  change orders  changes in commodity prices particularly steel and escalation of labor costs 
construction contracts for the corpus christi and creole trail pipelines have not been negotiated

accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them 
accounting for lng activities we begin capitalizing the costs of our lng receiving terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following criteria i regulatory approval has been received  ii financing for the project is available and iii management has committed to commence construction 
prior to meeting these criteria  most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred 
these costs primarily include professional fees associated with front end engineering and design work  costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals  and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our lng receiving terminals and related natural gas pipelines 

table of contents costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include land costs  costs of lease options and the cost of certain permits which are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
the costs of lease options are amortized over the life of the lease once it is obtained 
if no lease is obtained  the costs are expensed 
site rental costs and related amortization of capitalized options have been capitalized during the construction period through the end of beginning in  such costs will be expensed as required by fsp during the construction periods of our lng receiving terminals and related pipelines  we capitalize interest and other related debt costs in accordance with the fasb sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  as amended by sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method an amendment of fasb statement no 

upon commencement of operations  capitalized interest  as a component of the total cost  will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
revenue recognition lng regasification capacity fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the respective tuas 
advance capacity reservation fees are initially deferred 
full cost method of accounting we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and non productive exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  together with internal costs directly attributable to property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the costs of our oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and the carrying amounts of any asset retirement obligations  are depreciated using a composite unit of production rate based on estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  then the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
net capitalized costs are limited to a capitalization ceiling  calculated on a quarterly basis as the aggregate of the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves based on current economic and operating conditions  but excluding asset retirement obligations  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  less related income tax effects 
our allocation of seismic exploration costs between proved and unproved properties involves an estimate of the total reserves to be discovered through our exploration program 
this estimate includes a number of assumptions that we have incorporated into a three year plan 
such factors include an estimate of the number of exploration prospects generated  prospect reserve potential  success ratios and ownership interests 
we transfer unproved properties to proved properties based on a ratio of proved reserves discovered at a point in time to the estimate of total reserves to be discovered in our exploration program 
the carrying value of unproved properties is evaluated for possible impairment by comparing it to the estimated future net cash flows associated with the estimated total reserves to be discovered in our exploration program 
to the extent that the carrying value of unproved properties is greater than the estimated future net revenue  any excess is transferred to proved properties 
it is reasonably possible  based on the results obtained from future drilling and prospect generation  that revisions to this estimate of total reserves to be discovered could affect our capitalization ceiling 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves 

table of contents we account for the retirement of our tangible long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
subsequently  the asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are allocated to expense using the unit of production method used to depreciate oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and our reserve data are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
at least annually  our reserves are estimated by an independent petroleum engineer 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the present value of future net cash flows does not necessarily represent the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimate of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases thereby reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
cash flow hedges as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  cash flow hedge transactions hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows ie  in our case  the variability of floating interest rate exposure 
in the case of cash flow hedges  the hedged item the underlying risk is generally unrecognized ie  not recorded on the balance sheet prior to settlement  and any changes in the fair value  therefore  will not be recorded within earnings 
conceptually  if a cash flow hedge is effective  this means that a variable  such as a movement in interest rates  has been effectively fixed so that any fluctuations will have no net result on either cash flows or earnings 
therefore  if the changes in fair value of the hedged item are not recorded in earnings  then the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument the derivative must also be excluded from the income statement or else a one sided net impact on earnings will be reported  despite the fact that the establishment of the effective hedge results in no net economic impact 
to prevent such a scenario from occurring  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge be recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet  but with the offset reported as part of other comprehensive income  to the extent that the hedge is effective 
any ineffective portion will be reflected in earnings 

table of contents goodwill goodwill is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year  although we may perform a goodwill impairment review more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable

sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
from inception through december   we have accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method pursuant to apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and non vested stock  be recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values intrinsic value in the case of non vested stock at the time such awards are granted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the development of our lng receiving terminal business is based upon the foundational premise that prices of natural gas in the us will be sustained at levels of per mcf or more 
should the price of natural gas in the us decline to sustained levels below per mcf  our ability to develop and operate lng receiving terminals could be significantly negatively affected
