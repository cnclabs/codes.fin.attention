item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue  net income loss  and total assets for the last three years 
our strategy rising healthcare costs and health insurance premiums are causing employers  as well as federal and state government programs  to shift more of the cost of healthcare benefits to consumers in the form of higher premium contributions  deductibles  co insurance and co payments 
since  average premiums for family coverage in the united states increased  while wages grew only 
typical family out of pocket healthcare costs now exceed of the average annual wage 
as a result of increased personal spending on healthcare  healthcare consumers ie  employees and their family members  individuals  and retirees are demanding better service  efficiency  and value from their health plan 
this includes improved information regarding health care benefit and insurance coverage options  better information to determine the most efficient methods to fund out of pocket costs  real time information regarding benefits eligibility and accessibility  accurate information at the point of service regarding out of pocket costs ie  patient or consumer financial responsibility  real time information regarding healthcare fund balances and claims payment status  and increased comparative data and intelligence regarding healthcare provider cost ie  pricing and quality 
we believe that payers will play a central and critical role in the evolution of the us healthcare industry 
we also believe that most health plans and benefits administrators must evolve and improve their technology infrastructures  software applications  and business processes to compete in this changing healthcare marketplace 
we recognize that the evolution of the healthcare industry to a more retail like environment may be gradual 
our strategy  therefore  is to protect our existing customers investment in our products and services through ongoing research and development that allows for systematic upgrades of existing capabilities  while providing both existing and new payer customers with innovative it expertise  technology based products and services that help them strengthen their it capabilities  and transform their businesses to prosper in this more consumer centric environment

outsourced business services in  we derived approximately of our total revenue from outsourced business services 
our outsourced business services fall into two categories  software hosting and application management and business process outsourcing  both of which are described in more detail below 
software hosting and application management 
software hosting services include integrating  hosting  monitoring  and managing our proprietary software applications alongside other software applications from third party vendors 
we deliver software on a cost predictable subscription basis  through multi year contracts that include service levels

sales and marketing our primary sales and marketing approach is to utilize our direct sales force to promote trizetto as the single source for comprehensive healthcare information technology products and services to payers 
as of december   we had approximately sales  sales support  account management and marketing employees throughout the united states 
our professional sales force  comprised of experienced sales executives  sells our entire range of offerings to current and prospective customers  including enterprise software  specialized component software  outsourced business services  and consulting services

the product 
table of contents marketing team works closely with our business unit leadership to help bring our products and services to commercial ready status  as well as to adapt messaging to support key target market segments such as consumer directed and government sponsored 
our professional services group works closely with the sales organization to provide a consultative  executive selling approach that complements our sales program 
this team of healthcare information technology professionals is trained in a proprietary assessment methodology that allows a quick and comprehensive analysis of a customer s information technology capabilities and requirements 
in conjunction with their consulting responsibilities  our professional services group identifies opportunities to introduce customers to the broad range of applications and technology solutions available to them  including those that we offer 
customer service we believe that personalized support is necessary to maintain long term relationships with our customers 
an account manager is assigned to each of our larger services customers and many of our installed software customers 
they are responsible for proactively monitoring customer satisfaction  providing customers with additional training and process improvement opportunities  and coordinating issue resolution 
we employ functional and technical support personnel who work directly with our account management team and customers to resolve technical  operational and application problems or questions 
our service desk provides a wide range of customer support functions 
our customers may contact the service desk through a toll free number hours a day  seven days a week

this allows our support staff to learn from the experience of other people within the organization and reduces the time it takes to solve problems 
in addition  we provide customer support for our business process outsourcing services 
competition the market for healthcare information technology services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving  highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change 
by using proprietary technologies and methods  we develop  integrate and deliver packaged enterprise and component software applications  connectivity solutions for both internet and direct communication  application hosting  infrastructure outsourced business services and it consulting services 
our competitors provide some or all of the services that we provide 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  computer sciences corporation  and electronic data systems corporation  healthcare software application vendors  such as quality care solutions  inc and amisys synertech inc  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  superior consultant holdings corporation and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as emdeon corporation formerly webmd corporation  navimedix and healthtrio  and enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m 
table of contents each of these types of companies can be expected to compete with us within various segments of the healthcare information technology market 
furthermore  major software information systems companies and other entities  including those specializing in the healthcare industry that are not presently offering applications that compete with our products and services  may enter our markets 
in addition  some of our third party software vendors compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
we believe companies in our industry primarily compete based on performance  price  software functionality  ease of implementation  level of service  and track record of successful customer installations 
although our competitive position is difficult to characterize due principally to the variety of current and potential competitors and the evolving nature of our market  we believe that we presently compete favorably with respect to all of these factors 
while our competition comes from many industry segments  we believe no other single company offers the integrated  single source solution that we provide to our customers 
to be competitive  we must continue to enhance our products and services  as well as our sales  marketing  and distribution channels to respond promptly and effectively to changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation  constantly evolving standards and government regulation affecting healthcare transactions  the challenges of technological innovation and adoption  evolving business practices of our customers  our competitors new products and services  new products and services developed by our vendor partners and suppliers  and challenges in hiring and retaining information technology professionals 
backlog our total backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate in future periods from existing customer contracts 
our month backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate from existing customer contracts over the next months 
most of the revenue in our backlog is derived from multi year recurring revenue contracts including software hosting  business process outsourcing  it outsourcing  and software maintenance with a period ranging from three to five years 
we classify revenue from software license and consulting contracts as non recurring 
consulting revenue is included in the backlog when the revenue from such consulting contract will be recognized over a period exceeding months 
backlog can change due to a number of factors  including unforeseen changes in implementation schedules  contract cancellations subject to penalties paid by the customer  or customer financial difficulties 
unless we enter into new customer agreements that generate enough revenue to replace or exceed the revenue that is recognized in any given quarter  our backlog will decline 
our backlog at any date may not indicate demand for our products and services  and may not reflect actual revenue for any period in the future 
our total backlog at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  the month backlog at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  for a breakout of total and month backlog by recurring and non recurring revenue  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our intellectual property is important to our business 
we rely on certain developed software assets and internal methodologies for performing customer services 
our consulting services group develops and utilizes information technology life cycle methodology and related paper based and software based toolsets to perform 
table of contents customer assessments  planning  design  development  implementation  and support services 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also rely on a variety of technologies that are licensed from third parties to perform key functions 
these third party licenses are an essential element of our hosted solutions business 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms in the future 
the loss of or inability to maintain any of these licenses could delay the introduction of software enhancements and other features until equivalent technology can be licensed or developed 
any such delay could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
significant customers as of december  we were providing services to approximately unique customers 
two of our customers  the regence group and united healthcare services  inc  represented an aggregate of approximately of our consolidated revenue in and these same two customers generated and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues in no single customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable and consolidated revenues in and employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we generally have good relations with our employees

item a risk factors we have a history of operating losses and cannot predict if we will be able to sustain our positive net income 
we have generated net losses in of our past quarters through december  
we may not be able to sustain our current level of revenue or increase our revenue in the future 
we currently derive our revenue primarily from providing hosted solutions  software licensing and maintenance  and other services such as 
table of contents consulting 
we depend on the continued demand for healthcare information technology and related services 
we plan to continue investing in administrative infrastructure  research and development  sales and marketing  and acquisitions 
if we are not able to sustain our current levels of revenue or maintain our profitability  our operations may be adversely affected 
revenue from a limited number of customers comprises a significant portion of our total revenue  and if these customers terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  it could adversely affect our earnings 
as of december  we were providing services to unique customers 
two of our customers  the regence group and united healthcare  inc  represented an aggregate of approximately of our consolidated revenue in and these same two customers generated and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues in no single customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable and consolidated revenues in and although we typically enter into multi year customer agreements  a majority of our customers are able to reduce or cancel their use of our services before the end of the contract term  subject to monetary penalties 
we also provide services to some hosted customers without long term contracts 
in addition  many of our contracts are structured so that we generate revenue based on units of volume  which include the number of members  number of workstations or number of users 
if our customers experience business difficulties and the units of volume decline or if a customer ceases operations for any reason  we will generate less revenue under these contracts and our operating results may be materially and adversely impacted 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated contract cancellations or reductions 
as a result  any termination  significant reduction or modification of our business relationships with any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our business is changing rapidly  which could cause our quarterly operating results to vary and our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary in future periods 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly based on a number of factors  such as our mix of non recurring and recurring revenue  our ability to add new customers and renew existing accounts  selling additional products and services to existing customers  long and unpredictable sales cycles  meeting project milestones and customer expectations  seasonality in information technology purchases  the timing of new customer sales  and general economic conditions 
variations in our quarterly operating results could cause us to not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of our investors  which could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner that may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we do not achieve our expected revenue targets  we may not be able to reduce our short term spending in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 

table of contents the intensifying competition we face from both established entities and new entries in the market may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
the market for our technology and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing and requires potentially expensive technological advances 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources  and greater market recognition than we have 
many of our competitors also have  or may develop or acquire  substantial installed customer bases in the healthcare industry 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their applications or services than we can devote 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  computer sciences corporation  and electronic data systems corporation  healthcare information software vendors  such as quality care solutions  inc  and amisys synertech inc  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  superior consultant holdings corporation and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as emdeon corporation formerly webmd corporation  navimedix and healthtrio  and enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m in addition  some of our third party software vendors may compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
further  other entities that do not presently compete with us may do so in the future  including major software information systems companies  financial services entities  or health plans 
we believe our ability to compete will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and continue to develop partnerships with vendors  enhance our current technology and services  respond effectively to technological changes  introduce new technologies  and meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  pricing  gross margin  and market share could be negatively impacted further as a greater number of available products in the marketplace increases the likelihood that product and service offerings in our markets become more fungible and price sensitive 
our sales cycles are long and unpredictable 
we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles  particularly for contracts with large customers  or customers purchasing multiple products and services 
enterprise software typically requires significant capital expenditures by customers  and the decision to outsource it related services is complicated and time consuming 
major purchases by large payer organizations typically range from to months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
the prospects currently in our pipeline may not sign contracts within a reasonable period of time or at all 

table of contents in addition  our implementation cycle has ranged from to months or longer from contract execution to completion of implementation 
during the sales cycle and the implementation cycle  we will expend substantial time  effort  and financial resources preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract  and implementing the solution 
we may not realize any revenue to offset these expenditures  and  if we do  accounting principles may not allow us to recognize the revenue during corresponding periods  which could harm our future operating results 
additionally  any decision by our customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues 
consolidation of healthcare payer organizations and benefits administrators could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
there has been and continues to be acquisition and consolidation activity among healthcare payers and benefits administrators 
mergers or consolidations of payer organizations or payer organizations in the future could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
the acquisition of a customer could reduce our revenue and have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial condition 
a smaller overall market for our products and services could also result in lower revenue and margins 
in addition  healthcare payer organizations are increasing their focus on consumer directed healthcare  in which consumers interact directly with health plans through administrative services provided by health plans to employer groups 
these services compete with the services provided by benefits administrators and could result in additional consolidation in the benefits administration market 
some of our significant customers may develop their own software solutions  which could decrease the demand for our products 
some of our customers in the healthcare payer industry have  or may seek to acquire  the financial and technological resources necessary to develop software solutions to perform the functions currently serviced by our products and services 
additionally  consolidation in the healthcare payer industry could result in additional organizations having the resources necessary to develop similar software solutions 
if these organizations successfully develop and utilize their own software solutions  they may discontinue their use of our products or services  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on our software application vendor relationships  and if our software application vendors terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  or if we are unable to establish new relationships with additional software application vendors  it could harm our business 
we depend  and will continue to depend  on our licensing and business relationships with third party software application vendors 
our success depends significantly on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with our vendors and to build new relationships with other vendors in order to enhance our services and application offerings and remain competitive 
although most of our licensing agreements are perpetual or automatically renewable  they are subject to termination in the event that we materially breach such agreements 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with our vendors or establish relationships with new vendors 
the software  products or services of our third party vendors may not achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success 
accordingly  our existing relationships may not result in sustained business partnerships  successful product or service offerings or the generation of significant revenue for us 
our arrangements with third party software application vendors are not exclusive 
these third party vendors may not regard our relationships with them as important to their own respective businesses and operations 
they may reassess their commitment to us at any time and may choose to develop or enhance their own competing distribution channels and product support services 
if we do not maintain our existing relationships or if the economic terms of our business relationships change  we may not be able to license and offer these services and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay service development or timely introduction of new services and divert our resources 
any such delays could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 

table of contents our licenses for the use of third party software applications are essential to the technology solutions we provide for our customers 
loss of any one of our major vendor agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
we rely on third party software vendors for components of our software products 
our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors  and we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functions provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective  or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm the sale of our products unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us  such alternate sources may not be available to us in a timely manner  may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use 
we have sustained rapid growth  and our inability to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations since inception and expect to continue to do so 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  and financial resources  and information systems 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
our acquisition strategy may disrupt our business and require additional financing 
since inception  we have made eight acquisitions 
a significant portion of our historical growth has occurred through acquisitions and we may continue to seek strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we compete with other companies to acquire businesses  making it difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms or at all 
acquisitions may require significant capital  typically entail many risks  and can result in difficulties integrating operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired businesses 
we may be unable to successfully integrate companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in a timely manner 
if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 
in addition  the integration of our acquisitions may divert our management s attention from our existing business  which could damage our relationships with our key customers and employees 
to finance future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we may also incur debt and additional amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
the interest expense related to this debt and additional amortization expense may significantly reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
acquisitions may also result in large one time charges as well as goodwill and intangible assets and impairment charges in the future that could negatively impact our operating results 
our need for additional financing is uncertain as is our ability to raise capital if required 
if we are not able to sustain our positive net income  we may need additional financing to fund operations or growth 
we may not be able to raise additional funds through public or private financings  at any particular point in the future or on favorable terms 
future financings could adversely affect our common stock and debt securities 

table of contents our business will suffer if our software products contain errors 
the proprietary and third party software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite our testing and quality control procedures  errors may be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy those products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our costs would increase 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
we could lose customers and revenue if we fail to meet the performance standards and other obligations in our contracts 
many of our service agreements contain performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards or breach other material obligations under our agreements  our customers could terminate their agreements with us or require that we refund part or all of the fees charged under those agreements 
the termination of any of our material services agreements and or any associated refunds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
if our ability to expand our network and computing infrastructure is constrained in any way  we could lose customers and damage our operating results 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network and technology infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing customer requirements 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our hosted solutions or be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing needs on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost or at all 
our current information systems  procedures and controls may not continue to support our operations while maintaining acceptable overall performance and may hinder our ability to exploit the market for healthcare applications and services 
service lapses could cause our users to switch to the services of our competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
performance or security problems with our systems could damage our business 
our customers satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we  or our customers  experience any system delays  failures  or loss of data 

table of contents although we devote substantial resources to avoid performance problems  errors may occur 
errors in the processing of customer data may result in loss of data  inaccurate information  and delays 
such errors could cause us to lose customers and be liable for damages 
we currently process substantially all of our customers transactions and data at our data centers in colorado 
although we have safeguards for emergencies and we have contracted backup processing for our customers critical functions  the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data 
in addition  we depend on the efficient operation of telecommunication providers that have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability to us 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our data centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties  or similar disruptive problems 
our services agreements generally contain limitations on liability  and we maintain insurance with coverage limits of million for general liability and million for professional liability to protect against claims associated with the use of our products and services 
however  the contractual provisions and insurance coverage may not provide adequate coverage against all possible claims that may be asserted 
in addition  appropriate insurance may be unavailable in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
even unsuccessful claims could result in litigation or arbitration costs and may divert management s attention from our existing business 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate management and other key personnel 
our success will depend in large part on the continued services of management and key personnel 
competition for personnel in the healthcare information technology market is intense  and there are a limited number of persons with knowledge of  and experience in  this industry 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our executive officers  so any of these individuals may terminate his or her employment with us at any time 
the loss of services from one or more of our management or key personnel  or the inability to hire additional management or key personnel as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
although we currently experience relatively low rates of turnover for our management and key personnel  the rate of turnover may increase in the future 
in addition  we expect to further grow our operations and our needs for additional management and key personnel will increase 
our continued ability to compete effectively in our business depends on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate these individuals 
we rely on an adequate supply and performance of computer hardware and related equipment from third parties to provide services to larger customers and any significant interruption in the availability or performance of third party hardware and related equipment could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products to certain customers on a timely basis 
as we offer our hosted solution services and software to a greater number of customers and particularly to larger customers  we may be required to obtain specialized computer equipment from third parties that can be difficult to obtain on short notice 
any delay in obtaining such equipment may prevent us from delivering large systems to our customers on a timely basis 
we also may rely on such equipment to meet required performance standards 
we may have no control over the resources that third parties may devote to service our customers or satisfy performance standards 
if such performance standards are not met  we may be adversely impacted under our service agreements with our customers 

table of contents any failure or inability to protect our technology and confidential information could adversely affect our business 
our success depends in part upon proprietary software and other confidential information 
the software and information technology industries have experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of software products and other proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
however  these protections may not be sufficient  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with certain employees and our suppliers  as well as limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
the departure of any of our management and technical personnel  the breach of their confidentiality and non disclosure obligations to us  or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not have non compete agreements with our employees who are generally employed on an at will basis 
therefore  we have had  and may continue to have  employees leave us and go to work for competitors 
if we are not successful in prohibiting the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology or the use of our processes by a competitor  our competitive advantage may be significantly reduced which would result in reduced revenues 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states and many other countries are not publicly disclosed until a patent is issued  applications covering technology used in our software products may have been filed without our knowledge 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention away from running our business and seriously harm our business 
if we were to discover that our products violated the intellectual property rights of others  we would have to obtain licenses from these parties in order to continue marketing our products without substantial reengineering 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  and if we could not obtain such licenses  we might not be able to reengineer our products successfully or in a timely fashion 
if we fail to address any infringement issues successfully  we would be forced to incur significant costs  including damages and potentially satisfying indemnification obligations that we have with our customers  and we could be prevented from selling certain of our products 
currently  we are a party to a lawsuit filed against us by mckesson information solutions llc in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging that we have made  used  offered for sale  and or sold a system that infringes mckesson s united states patent no 
 entitled system and method for detecting fraudulent medical claims via examination of services codes 
mckesson seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages  including treble damages for willful infringement 
an adverse decision in this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our consulting services revenue does not grow substantially  our revenue growth could be adversely impacted 
our consulting services revenue represents a significant component of our total revenue and we anticipate that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
the level of consulting services revenue depends upon the healthcare industry s demand for outsourced information technology services and our ability to deliver products that generate implementation and follow on consulting services revenue 
our 
table of contents ability to increase services revenue will depend in part on our ability to increase the capacity of our consulting group  including our ability to recruit  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
the insolvency of our customers or the inability of our customers to pay for our services could negatively affect our financial condition 
healthcare payers are often required to maintain restricted cash reserves and satisfy strict balance sheet ratios promulgated by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  healthcare payers are subject to risks that physician groups or associations within their organizations become subject to costly litigation or become insolvent  which may adversely affect the financial stability of the payer 
if healthcare payers are unable to pay for our services because of their need to maintain cash reserves or failure to maintain balance sheet ratios or solvency  our ability to collect fees for services rendered would be impaired and our financial condition could be adversely affected 
changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
in addition  proposals to substantially reform medicare  medicaid  and the healthcare system in general have been or are being considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may further increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates  and otherwise adversely affect the healthcare industry which could adversely impact our business 
the impact of regulatory developments in the healthcare industry is complex and difficult to predict  and our business could be adversely affected by existing or new healthcare regulatory requirements or interpretations 
participants in the healthcare industry  such as our payer customers  are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations  including laws and regulations relating to the confidential treatment and secure transmission of patient medical records  and other healthcare information 
legislators at both the state and federal levels have proposed and enacted additional legislation relating to the use and disclosure of medical information  and the federal government is likely to enact new federal laws or regulations in the near future 
pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  the department of health and human services dhhs has issued a series of regulations setting forth security  privacy and transactions standards for all health plans  clearinghouses  and healthcare providers to follow with respect to individually identifiable health information 
dhhs has issued final regulations mandating the use of standard transactions and code sets  which became effective october  dhhs has also issued final hipaa privacy regulations  which required covered entities to be in compliance by april   and final hipaa security regulations  which required covered entities to be in compliance by april  many of our customers will also be subject to state laws implementing the federal gramm leach bliley act  relating to certain disclosures of nonpublic personal health information and nonpublic personal financial information by insurers and health plans 
our payer customers must comply with hipaa  its regulations  and other applicable healthcare laws and regulations 
in addition  we may be deemed to be a covered entity subject to hipaa because we offer our customers products that convert data to a hipaa compliant format 
accordingly  we must comply with certain provisions of hipaa and in order for our products and services to be marketable  they must contain features and functions that allow our customers to comply with hipaa and other healthcare laws and regulations 
we believe our products currently allow our customers to comply with existing laws and regulations 
however  because hipaa and its regulations have yet to be fully interpreted  our products may require modification in the future 
if we fail to offer solutions that permit our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations  our business will suffer 
we perform billing and claims services that are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws 
the federal government in recent years has imposed heightened scrutiny on billing and collection practices 
table of contents of healthcare providers and related entities  particularly with respect to potentially fraudulent billing practices  such as submissions of inflated claims for payment and upcoding 
violations of the laws regarding billing and coding may lead to civil monetary penalties  criminal fines  imprisonment  or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs for our customers and for us 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows 
federal and state consumer protection laws may apply to us when we bill patients directly for the cost of physician services provided 
failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in a loss of licensure or other fines and penalties 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
in addition  laws governing healthcare payers are often not uniform among states 
this could require us to undertake the expense and difficulty of tailoring our products in order for our customers to be in compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations 
part of our business is subject to government regulation relating to the internet that could impair our operations 
the internet and its associated technologies are subject to increasing government regulation 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal  state  local  and foreign governments  and agencies 
laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  on line content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the methods of the internet based hosted  software and information technology solutions we offer 
we believe  however  that these laws may be applied to us 
we expect our products and services to be in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local laws and regulations governing our operations 
however  new legal requirements or interpretations applicable to the internet could decrease the growth in the use of the internet  limit the use of the internet for our products and services or prohibit the sale of a particular product or service  increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
to the extent that we market our products and services outside the united states  the international regulatory environment relating to the internet and healthcare services could also have an adverse effect on our business 
increased leverage as a result of our convertible note offering may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
on october   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due notes 
the indebtedness under the notes constitutes senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated october  the indenture with wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
the notes are convertible  under certain circumstances  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  or shares for each  principal amount of notes 
upon conversion of the notes  we will have the right to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
the notes mature on october  however  on or after october   we may from time to time at our option redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the redemption date 
on each of october   october  and october   holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the purchase date 
in addition  holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change  as described in the indenture  at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal 
table of contents amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the fundamental change repurchase date 
additionally  the notes may become immediately due and payable upon an event of default  as defined in the indenture 
in january  we amended our credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc increasing the amount of our revolving credit facility from million to million 
as of december   our total consolidated long term debt was million 
in addition  the indenture does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and we may choose to incur additional debt in the future 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you  because it could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes or our credit facility  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  expansion  acquisitions or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to our success in marketing our products and services  general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  to sell assets  and or to reduce or delay planned expenditures on research and development and or commercialization activities 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 
we may not be able to repurchase the notes or pay the amounts due upon conversion of the notes when necessary 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the notes as discussed in the preceding risk factor 
if we are required to repurchase the notes  including following a change in control or other event that constitutes a fundamental change or at the option of the holder on october   or  we may not be able to pay the amount required when necessary 
our ability to repurchase the notes is effectively subordinated to our senior credit facility and may be limited by law  by the indenture  by the terms of other agreements relating to our senior debt and by indebtedness and agreements that we may enter into in the future which may replace  supplement or amend our existing or future debt 
if we are required to repurchase the notes  including following a change in control or other event that constitutes a fundamental change or on october   or when we are prohibited from repurchasing or redeeming the notes  we could seek the consent of lenders to repurchase the notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain this prohibition 
if we do not obtain a consent or refinance these borrowings  we would remain prohibited from repurchasing the notes  which would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in addition  we could seek to obtain third party financing to pay for any amounts due in cash upon conversion of the notes  but such 
table of contents third party financing may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure to repurchase the notes or make the required payments upon conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which would in turn constitute a default under the terms of our senior credit facility and other indebtedness at that time 
future issuances of common stock may depress the trading price of our common stock 
any issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes  could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock 
we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations  business strategy and future acquisitions  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 
our stockholder rights plan and charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our stockholder rights plan and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing shareholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which in turn  could harm our stock price

our attorney fees and other defense costs related to this matter are being expensed as incurred 
if it is determined that our clinical editing software infringes mckesson s patent and the injunction sought by mckesson is granted by the court  we could be liable for substantial monetary damages and be precluded from offering clinical editing software to our customers 
in addition  pursuant to contractual obligations with many of our facts  facets and qiclink customers  we may be required  at our cost  to replace our clinical editing software with a non infringing alternative solution

as a result of this settlement  we estimated that this project would generate a total loss of million until its completion  which was expected to occur in mid this loss was charged to non recurring cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of in  we determined that the large fixed fee implementation project would require a greater effort to complete than previously estimated 
as a result  we accrued an additional million of loss on contracts charges in the first six months of in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a settlement of additional out of scope work  which decreased the total loss on the project and resulted in the reversal of approximately  of previously accrued loss on contracts charges 
this fixed fee implementation was completed by the end of the first quarter of the total amount of loss actually incurred on this project was million in and  in the first quarter of as of january   we adopted the rules set forth in financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which states that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will be subject to annual impairment tests instead of being amortized 
effective january   goodwill  along with acquired workforce reclassified to goodwill in accordance with fasb statement no 
 are no longer being amortized 
in december  we initiated a number of restructuring actions focused on eliminating redundancies  streamlining operations and improving overall financial results 
these initiatives included workforce reductions  office closures  discontinuation of certain business lines and related asset write offs 
in the fourth quarter of  approximately  of restructuring expense was reversed related to the lease settlements for the facility closures in naperville  illinois and westmont  illinois  which were previously accrued for in fiscal year as a result of our decision in the fourth quarter of to wind down our outsourcing services to physician groups and to discontinue our outsourcing services to certain non facets payer customers  we estimated that our future net cash flows from the assets used in these businesses would recover their net book value 
accordingly  a total charge of million was taken as a restructuring and impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  which represented the net book value of these assets 
the assets were written off in the first quarter of 
table of contents after the end of the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization decreased to a level that required us to perform additional analyses under fasb statement no 
to quantify the amount of impairment to goodwill 
this analysis resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill of million as of december  the decrease in market capitalization was also an indicator that our other intangible assets might also be impaired as of december   and they were also tested for impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the analysis resulted in an additional impairment charge of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we offer a broad portfolio of proprietary information technology products and services targeted to the payer industry  which is comprised of health insurance plans and third party benefits administrators 
we offer enterprise administration software  including facets extended enterprise and qiclink extended enterprise  specialized component software  including our networx products for provider network management  careadvance care management software  healthweb suite of web interface tools  cdh account management and workflow add on modules for facets and directlink direct connectivity claims transaction software  software hosting services and business process outsourcing services  which provide variable cost alternatives to licensing software  and strategic  installation  and optimization consulting services 
we provide products and services to unique customers in the health plan and benefits administrator markets  which we refer to as payers 
in  these markets represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
as of december   we were no longer providing services to physician group customers 
we measure financial performance by monitoring recurring revenue and non recurring revenue  bookings and backlog  gross profit  and net income loss 
total revenue for was million compared to million in recurring revenue for was million compared to million in non recurring revenue for was million compared to million in bookings for were million compared to million in backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  gross profit was million in compared to million in net income in was million compared to million in these financial comparisons are further explained in the section below  results of operations 
we generate recurring revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and business process outsourcing services  and the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary and certain of our non proprietary software products 
we generate non recurring revenue from the licensing of our software and from consulting fees for implementation  installation  configuration  business process engineering  data conversion  testing and training related to the use of our proprietary  and third party licensed products 
cost of revenue includes costs related to the products and services we provide to our customers and costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our customer connectivity centers 
these costs include salaries and related expenses for consulting personnel  customer connectivity centers personnel  customer support personnel  application software license fees  amortization of capitalized software development costs  telecommunications costs  and maintenance costs 
research and development r d expenses are salaries and related expenses associated with the development of software applications prior to establishing technological feasibility 
such expenses include compensation paid to software engineering personnel and fees to outside contractors and consultants 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales  sales commissions  account management  marketing  administrative  finance  legal  human resources and executive personnel  and fees for certain professional services 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to increase revenue per customer by continuing to introduce new complementary products and services to our established enterprise software and hosting and business process outsourcing services 
many of these service offerings  including hosting  business process outsourcing  and consulting have a higher cost of revenue  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
therefore  to the extent that our 
table of contents revenue increases through the sale of these lower margin product and service offerings  our total gross profit margin may decrease 
we are continuing to target larger health plan customers 
this has given us the opportunity to sell additional services such as software hosting  business intelligence  and business process outsourcing services 
as the technology requirements of our customers become more sophisticated  our service offerings have become more complex 
this has lengthened our sales cycles and made it more difficult for us to predict the timing of our software and services sales 
on september   coventry health care  inc coventry acquired altius health plans  inc altius  one of our outsourced services customers 
as a result  our services agreement with altius was terminated effective may  revenue from the altius services agreement was million in  which included a million termination fee  and million in through the date of termination 
in late  a management decision was made to exit certain non strategic and less profitable product offerings and business lines 
this decision included winding down services related to our physician group customers  as well as the planned elimination of our hosting and business process outsourcing services for two competing third party software platforms 
early in the second quarter of  we executed termination agreements with two of our remaining physician group customers 
we continued to provide outsourced business services through may  when the transition services were completed 
in the second quarter of  we initiated certain cost containment efforts  which included workforce reductions  modifications to certain employee benefit programs and other actions 
we realized a significant portion of these benefits in the third and fourth quarters of in december  our management and administrative services agreement with preferred health networks  inc phn  was amended to substantially reduce the scope of our hosting and business process outsourcing services 
phn requested an extension of these reduced services through march   when it plans to complete the wind down of its operations 
revenue from the phn management and administrative services agreement was  in and million in critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
those estimates are based on our experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  up front payments to customers  sales returns and allowance doubtful accounts  capitalization of software development costs

this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
our revenue is classified into two categories recurring and non recurring 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was recurring and was non recurring 
we generate recurring revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and other business services  and the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary software products 
recurring services revenue is typically billed and recognized monthly over the contract term  typically three to seven years 
many of our outsourcing agreements require us to maintain a certain level of operating performance 
we record revenue net of estimated penalties resulting from any failure to maintain the level of operating performance 
these penalties have not been significant in the past 
recurring software maintenance revenue is typically based on one year renewable contracts 
software maintenance and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period 
payment for software maintenance received in advance is recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
certain royalty costs paid to third party software vendors associated with software maintenance are amortized over the software maintenance period 
we generate non recurring revenue from the licensing of our software 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement  upon delivery of the software  when fees are fixed or determinable  when collectibility is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
for software license agreements in which customer acceptance is a significant condition of earning the license fees  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 
for software license agreements that require significant customizations or modifications of the software  revenue is recognized as the customization services are performed 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  such as software license  consulting services  outsourcing services and maintenance  and where vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vsoe  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
for arrangements in which vsoe does not exist for each undelivered element  including specified upgrades  revenue for the delivered element is deferred and not recognized until vsoe is available for the undelivered element or delivery of each element has occurred 
when multiple products are sold within a discounted arrangement  a proportionate amount of the discount is applied to each product based on each product s fair value or relative list price 
we also generate non recurring revenue from set up fees  which are services  hardware  and software associated with preparing our customer connectivity center or a customer s data center in order to ready a 
table of contents specific customer for software hosting services 
the set up fees are usually separate and distinct from the hosting fees  and performance of the set up services represents a culmination of the earnings process 
we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed using the percentage of completion basis and when we can reasonably estimate the cost of the set up project 
we also generate non recurring revenue from consulting fees for implementation  installation  configuration  business process engineering  data conversion  testing and training related to the use of our proprietary and third party licensed products 
in certain instances  we also generate non recurring revenue from customization services of our proprietary licensed products 
we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed  if contracted on a time and materials basis  or using the percentage of completion method  if contracted on a fixed fee basis and when we can adequately estimate the cost of the consulting project 
percentage of completion is measured based on cost incurred to date compared to total estimated cost at completion 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the cost to complete  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method  upon completion of all contractual obligations 
we also generate non recurring revenue from certain one time charges  including certain contractual fees such as termination fees and change of control fees  and we recognize the revenue for these fees once the termination or change of control is guaranteed  there are no remaining substantive performance obligations  and collection is reasonably assured 
other non recurring revenue is also generated from fees related to our product related conferences 
up front payments to customers 
we may pay certain up front amounts to our customers in connection with the establishment of our hosting and outsourcing services contracts 
these payments are regarded as discounts to the services contracts 
under eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  these payments are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue  provided that such amounts are recoverable from future revenue under the contract 
if an up front payment is not recoverable from future revenue  or it cannot be offset by contract cancellation penalties paid by the customer  the amount will be written off as an expense in the period it is deemed unrecoverable 
unamortized up front payments to customers were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for sales returns to reserve for estimated discounts  pricing adjustments  and other sales allowances 
the reserve is charged to revenue in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level we believe is adequate based on historical experience and current trends 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we base this allowance on estimates after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history and our evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional sales allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
we typically do not require collateral 
historically  our estimates for sales returns and doubtful account reserves have been adequate to cover accounts receivable exposures 
we continually monitor these reserves and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual credits or other allowances may differ from established reserves 
capitalization of software development costs 
the capitalization of software costs includes developed technology acquired in acquisitions and costs incurred by us in developing our products that qualify for capitalization 
we account for our software development costs  other than costs for internal use software  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize costs associated with product development  coding  and testing subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of the product 
technological feasibility is established after completion of a detailed program design or working model 
capitalization of computer software costs ceases upon a product s general availability release 
capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software product starting from the date of general availability 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  we monitor the expected net realizable value of the capitalized software for factors that would indicate impairment  such as a decline in the demand  the introduction of new technology  or the loss of a significant customer 
as of december   our evaluation determined that the carrying amount of these assets was not impaired 
loss on contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to wind down our outsourcing services to physician group customers 
as a result of this decision  we estimated that the existing customer agreements would generate a total loss of million until the terms of these agreements expired in this loss was charged to recurring cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of through discussions and negotiations  we were able to accelerate the termination of our services agreements with certain physician group customers and implemented cost cutting measures that reduced the expected future costs to support our remaining customers 
as a result of these actions  we were able to reverse approximately million of previously accrued loss on contracts charges in early in the second quarter of  we executed termination agreements with our two remaining physician group customers 
we continued to provide outsourced business services through may  when the transition services were completed 
the completion of these services to the remaining customers allowed us to reverse the remaining balance in the loss on contracts accrual of million in the second quarter of the total amount of loss actually incurred related to the outsourcing services to physician group customers was million in and  in the first six months of in december  we negotiated a settlement regarding out of scope work related to one of our large fixed fee implementation projects 
as a result of this settlement  we estimated that the project would generate a total loss of million until its completion  which was expected to occur in mid this loss was charged to non recurring cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of in  we determined that the large fixed fee implementation project would require a greater effort to complete than previously estimated 
as a result  we accrued an additional million of loss on contracts charges in the first six months of in the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a settlement of additional out of scope work  which decreased the total loss on the project and resulted in the reversal of approximately  of previously accrued loss on contracts charges 
this fixed fee implementation was completed by the end of the first quarter of the total amount of loss actually incurred on this project was million in and  in the first quarter of anticipated losses on fixed price contracts are accrued in the period in which they become known 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual or more often if indicators of impairment exist impairment tests using a two step process 
the first step looks for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are revealed in the first step  then the second step is conducted to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
we adopted fasb statement no 
effective as of january  we performed our annual impairment test on march   and this test did not reveal indications of impairment 
litigation accruals 
pending unsettled lawsuits involve complex questions of fact and law and may require expenditure of significant funds 
from time to time  we may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuits  however  there can be no assurance that any such discussions will occur or will result in a settlement 
moreover  the settlement of any pending litigation could require us to incur settlement payments and costs 
in the period in which a new legal case arises  an expense will be accrued if our liability to the other party is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review and analyze the adequacy of our accruals for each individual case for all pending litigations 
adjustments are recorded as needed to ensure appropriate levels of reserve 
our attorney fees and other defense costs related to litigation are expensed as incurred 
bonus accruals 
our corporate bonus model is designed to project the level of funding required under the corporate bonus program as approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
a significant portion of the corporate bonus program is based on the company meeting certain financial objectives  such as revenue  earnings per share  and the level of capital spending 
the expense related to the corporate bonus program is accrued in the year of performance and paid in the first quarter following the fiscal year end 
the corporate bonus model is analyzed on a quarterly basis to identify any necessary adjustments to the accrual in order to ensure appropriate funding for year end 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  fasb statement no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
we believe sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance is required on our net deferred tax assets at december  subsequent evidence including continued positive earnings trends may diminish this uncertainty to the point where we conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if and when we decrease the valuation allowance  approximately million will be allocated to income tax benefit  million will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill  and million will be recorded as an adjustment to equity for the benefit of employee stock option exercises 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision to fasb statement no 
and supersedes accounting principles board opinion and fasb statement no 
this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under fasb statement no 
may apply this statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under fasb statement no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of the retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by fasb statement no 
in april  the securities and exchange commission sec approved a new rule that delayed the effective date of sfas r 
for most public companies  the delay eliminates the comparability issues that would arise from adopting sfas r in the middle of their fiscal years as originally called for by sfas r 
except for this deferral of the effective date  the guidance in sfas r is unchanged 
under the sec s rule  sfas r is now effective for public companies for annual  rather than interim  periods that begin after june  we have evaluated the requirements under sfas r and plan to adopt on january  we believe that such adoption will have a substantial impact on our consolidated statements of operations and earnings per share 
subsequent events on january   we and each of our subsidiaries the borrowers  entered into amendment number two to our credit agreement the amendment with wells fargo foothill  inc  as the administrative agent and lender the lender 
the amendment amends the terms of our credit agreement dated december   by and among the borrowers and the lender the agreement 
the amendment increases the amount of the revolving credit facility under the agreement from million to up to million the facility  subject to certain fixed percentages of our recurring revenues  and extends 
table of contents the expiration date of the agreement to january  under the terms of the amendment  the principal outstanding under the facility will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to either i the libor rate plus an adjustable applicable margin of between and or ii wells fargo s prime rate plus an adjustable applicable margin of between and  at the election of the borrowers  subject to specified restrictions 
the unused portions of the facility will be subject to unused facility fees 
in the event the borrowers terminate the agreement  as amended by the amendment  prior to its expiration  the borrowers will be required to pay the lender a termination fee equal to of the maximum credit amount if the agreement is terminated prior to the second anniversary of the agreement or of the maximum credit amount if the agreement is terminated thereafter  up to days prior to the expiration date of the agreement  subject to specified exceptions 
we expect to use the proceeds for general working capital purposes 
under the agreement  as amended by the amendment  the borrowers have granted the lender a security interest in all of the assets of the borrowers 
the agreement  as amended by the amendment  contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on the borrowers with respect to indebtedness  liens  investments  distributions  mergers and acquisitions  dispositions of assets and transactions with affiliates of the borrowers 
the agreement  as amended  also includes financial covenants including minimum ebitda  minimum liquidity  minimum recurring revenue and maximum capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants and other restrictions under the agreement as of the date of the amendment 
on december   we completed our acquisition of carekey 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  carekey stockholders and optionholders were entitled to receive contingent consideration if certain customer retention conditions were met as of february  these conditions were met as of that date  and as a result  we expect to pay carekey stockholders and optionholders a total of million on february  revenue information revenue by customer type and revenue mix for the years ended december    and  is as follows amounts in thousands years ended december  revenue by customer type health plans benefits administration provider total revenue revenue mix recurring revenue outsourced business services software maintenance recurring revenue total non recurring revenue software license fees consulting services other non recurring revenue non recurring revenue total total revenue 
table of contents our total backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate in future periods from existing customer contracts 
our month backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate from existing customer contracts over the next months 
most of the revenue in our backlog is derived from multi year recurring revenue contracts including software hosting  business process outsourcing  it outsourcing  and software maintenance with a period ranging from three to five years 
we classify revenue from software license and consulting contracts as non recurring 
consulting revenue is included in the backlog when the revenue from such consulting contract will be recognized over a period exceeding months 
backlog can change due to a number of factors  including unforeseen changes in implementation schedules  contract cancellations subject to penalties paid by the customer  or customer financial difficulties 
in such event  unless we enter into new customer agreements that generate enough revenue to replace or exceed the revenue we expect to generate from our backlog in any given quarter  our backlog will decline 
our backlog at any date may not indicate demand for our products and services and may not reflect actual revenue for any period in the future 
our month and total backlog data are as follows in thousands month backlog recurring revenue non recurring revenue total total backlog recurring revenue non recurring revenue total total quarterly bookings equal the estimated total dollar value of the contracts signed in the quarter 
bookings can vary substantially from quarter to quarter  based on a number of factors  including the number and type of prospects in our pipeline  the length of time it takes a prospect to reach a decision and sign the contract  and the effectiveness of our sales force 
included in quarterly bookings are maintenance revenue and hosting and other services revenue up to seven years 
bookings for each of the quarters are as follows in thousands quarterly bookings results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in of this increase  million related to recurring revenue and million related to non recurring revenue 
recurring revenue 
recurring revenue includes outsourced business services primarily software hosting and business process outsourcing and maintenance fees related to our software license contracts 
recurring revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was the result of increases of million in software maintenance  and million of software hosting offsetting the loss of million of outsourced business services revenue from exited businesses and contracts 

table of contents the overall increase of million in software maintenance revenue primarily resulted from sales of our enterprise and component software in  including facets extended enterprise  qiclink extended enterprise  networx  careadvance and healthweb  workflow and hipaa gateway 
the overall decrease of million in outsourced business services revenue resulted primarily from i a million decline caused by the scheduled termination of our services for altius  ii a million decline resulting from the wind down of our services for phn  iii a million reduction resulting from the planned wind down of our services to physician group customers  and iv a million decrease from the planned elimination of our hosting and business process outsourcing services on certain competitive software platforms 
the effect of this million decline in outsourced business services revenue was offset in part by a net increase of million of additional revenue primarily from new facets hosted customers and increased membership from existing facets hosted and benefits administrator customers 
non recurring revenue 
non recurring revenue includes software license sales  consulting services revenue  and other non recurring revenue 
non recurring revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was the result of a million increase in consulting services and other non recurring revenue due primarily to the higher utilization of consulting resources on more profitable implementation projects  offset in part by a million decrease due to timing of software license sales compared to cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased million  or  from million in to million in the overall decrease in recurring cost of revenue of million primarily resulted from i reduced costs of million associated with the scheduled termination of our services for altius  ii a million reduction resulting from the planned wind down of our services to physician group customers  iii a decline of million related to the wind down of our services for phn  and iv a million net increase in costs to support the additional outsourced business services revenue from new facets hosted customers and existing benefits administrator customers 
the net increase of million represented higher incentive and compensation costs  increased royalty expense related to license deals  new software and equipment maintenance agreements  and new operating leases  which were offset in part by reduced outsourced contractor expenses from the completion of certain internal and customer related data center projects and reduced costs related to cost containment efforts 
the increase in non recurring cost of revenue of million resulted primarily from i an increase of million in the amortization of capitalized software development products related to the general release of additional products and ii million in higher incentive and compensation costs 
the effect of this million increase in non recurring cost of revenue was offset in part by a net decrease of million due primarily to lower outsourced consulting costs related to the completion of a large fixed fee implementation project  reduced royalty expense and hardware pass through costs  lower facilities expense related to an office closure  and a decrease in overall travel expense 
additionally  total net loss on contracts decreased million due to a higher amount of reversal of these charges in compared to the same period in  as described below 
loss on contracts 
we executed termination agreements with our two remaining physician group customers in the second quarter of  allowing us to reverse the remaining balance in our loss on contracts accrual of million  which reduced our total cost of revenue by an equal amount 
in  we reversed million of previously accrued recurring loss on contracts charges due to the accelerated termination of certain physician group contracts and the reduction of costs to support these remaining contracts 
additionally  in  we recorded a net million of non recurring loss on contracts charges  which primarily represented incremental hours required to complete a certain fixed fee implementation 
this fixed fee implementation project was completed by the end of the first quarter of as a percentage of total revenue  cost of revenue approximated in and in gross margin 
as a percentage of total revenue  the overall gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross margin percentage in was primarily the result of i higher utilization of 
table of contents consulting resources on more profitable implementation projects  ii management s decision to exit certain non strategic and less profitable product offerings and business lines  iii broad based improvements in new contract pricing  and iv continued benefit from cost containment actions taken in late and overall operational efficiencies 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this net increase was due primarily to increased spending related to the development of our proprietary software for the health plan and benefits administrator markets 
most of our r d expense was used to continue our development of facets extended enterprise  which is a substantial upgrade of our flagship software for health plans  and for the development of certain new component software 
several enhancements were also made to qiclink  a proprietary software product for benefits administrators and healthweb  our web enable platform  which allows health plans to exchange information on a secure basis over the internet 
as a percentage of total revenue  r d expenses approximated in and r d expenses  as a percentage of total r d expenditures which includes capitalized r d expenses of million in and  was in and in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the overall increase resulted primarily from i million in higher personnel costs  including higher incentive and compensation costs associated with certain senior staff additions in late and higher commission expenses incurred related to the timing of new contracts signed  ii a million increase in outsourced services primarily for strategic planning and process improvements  in addition to support and enhancements related to our enterprise reporting system  iii a million increase related primarily to defense costs for mckesson in compared to lower costs in  partially offset by a million insurance reimbursement received in related to the atpa litigation settlement  and iv approximately million in other expenses such as audit and compliance  executive travel  sales and marketing  and other corporate support costs 
sg a expenses also increased million due to the collection of a fully reserved note receivable in the second quarter of  which negatively affected the period comparison 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses approximated in compared to in amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets acquired in previous years  which were fully amortized in  partially offset by the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets in mid and late future amortization expense related to existing intangible assets is estimated to be as follows in thousands for the years ending december  and thereafter total amortization expense related to existing intangible assets will vary from amounts identified above in the event we recognize impairment charges prior to the amortized useful life of any intangible assets 
additionally  amortization expense will vary from amounts identified above when the final valuation related to the carekey acquisition is completed  and the allocation between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets is recorded 

table of contents interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in from  in the increase is due primarily to higher cash balances attributed to the proceeds from the convertible debt deal  as well as higher interest earned in our investment accounts 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  to million in from million in the increase relates primarily to interest incurred on the million convertible debt and borrowings on our revolving line of credit facility 
the effect of this increase was offset in part by lower balances on our capital leases and notes payable 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was  in compared to million in the provision decrease is due to a decrease in state income taxes from benefits recorded for return to provision adjustments related to state taxes and refunds received related to prior years for which income tax benefit was not previously recorded  offset partially by an increase in federal income taxes for alternative minimum tax 
the effective tax rate was for  which was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the decrease in release of valuation allowance  which occurred as a result of utilization of net operating loss nols carryovers 
the effective tax rate was for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  from million in to million in of this decrease  million related to recurring revenue and million related to non recurring revenue
