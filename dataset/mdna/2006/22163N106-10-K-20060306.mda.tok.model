item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the world s largest suppliers of retailer brand beverages 
was a challenging year for us and our industry as we faced unprecedented commodity cost increases and a consumer shift toward non carbonated beverages 
accordingly we undertook actions to increase financial performance by improving our operating performance  enhancing our sales focus and realigning our organization 
in september we announced a plan to realign the management of our canadian and us businesses to a north american basis 
the realignment is designed to leverage management strengths  improve supply chain efficiencies and position the north american business to become more profitable and responsive to customer needs 
additional key elements of our plan include rationalizing product offerings  eliminating under performing assets and increasing focus on high potential accounts 
in  we recorded million in pre tax unusual items per diluted share after tax  including restructuring charges of million  customer relationships impairment of million and other asset impairment of million 
as part of the north american realignment we closed our juice plant in lachine  quebec effective february and we plan to close our manufacturing plant in columbus  ohio effective march severance and lease cancellation costs relating to the closure of these plants are expected to be approximately million 
we completed the macaw acquisition in august for a purchase price of million million pounds sterling 
at the time of the macaw acquisition  macaw was the largest privately owned manufacturer of retailer brand carbonated soft drinks in the uk with six production lines in two production facilities including aseptic capabilities 
in june we began shipping from our new manufacturing facility in fort worth  texas 
as the largest plant in our global operations  fort worth is currently expected to produce about million physical cases for the total cost of this new plant is million  including million spent in our net income in was million or per diluted share  compared with million or per diluted share in the decrease resulted from asset impairment  restructuring and other unusual charges  higher packaging and raw materials costs that were only partially offset by increased prices  higher fixed costs from recently added production capacity  including the start up of our new fort worth  texas plant  changes in product mix toward lower margin bottled water in north america  the highly competitive environment in the north american carbonated soft drinks csd industry  and a higher effective tax rate

metro added million or  in the aggregate  to sales in as compared with as shown in the following table  sales increased when the impact of these acquisitions and foreign exchange are excluded 
total case volume in ounce equivalents for was  million  up from  million in excluding the impact of acquisitions  sales volume was up 
north uk inter cott america europe national change in sales impact of acquisitions impact of foreign exchange change excluding acquisitions exchange percentage change excluding acquisitions exchange in north america  our sales were  million in  an increase of from excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange  sales increased by almost from case volume in ounce equivalents decreased by almost in  down excluding the impact of acquisitions 
the volume decrease was driven by weakness in the north american csd market and was offset by selling price increases implemented in response to higher raw material costs 
in the uk and europe  our sales were million in  an increase of from million in excluding the impact of the macaw acquisition and the weakened pound sterling  sales increased in reflecting higher volume 
case volume in ounce equivalents was up from  an increase of excluding the macaw acquisition 
volume increased as customers expanded their retailer brand product offerings and we grew our contract packing business 
the international segment includes mexico  royal crown international and asia 
sales by this segment were million in  an increase of when compared with sales of million in excluding foreign exchange  sales increased 
sales in mexico continue to expand  reaching million for an increase of over cost of sales cost of sales was  million or of sales  a percentage point increase from  million or of sales in variable costs represented of total cost of sales in  down from in as a result of recent capacity additions 
major elements of these variable costs included ingredient and packaging costs  fees paid to third party manufacturers and distribution costs 
the increase in total cost of sales as a percent of sales reflects an increase in raw material costs as well as higher fixed costs 
raw material costs have increased primarily for packaging materials  including pet bottles and cans 
higher fixed costs result from recently added production capacity 
variable cost savings from the increase in the proportion of our north american production manufactured in our own facilities partially offset these increases 
gross profit gross profit was of sales for  down from in as realized selling price increases were more than offset by higher packaging and raw material prices 
the change in product mix toward lower margined bottled water and the fixed cost of additional plant capacities also contributed to lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a was million in  up slightly from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a declined to for  down from in excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange  sg a was down million from primarily due to lower incentive compensation and lower bad debt expense 
a million provision was recorded against a north american export receivable in unusual items in  we recorded charges for unusual items of million on a pre tax basis or per diluted share after tax 
unusual items were million before tax in and were primarily related to the writedown of an investment in an equity investee 
north america in  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges of million relating to our north american operations 
in september we announced a plan to realign the management of our canadian and us businesses to a north american basis 
we recorded restructuring charges of million  including million for severance payments and million for contract termination payments as part of this plan 
we anticipate additional charges of million including million for severance and million for contract terminations  relating to the closures of the columbus  ohio plant and the lachine  quebec juice plant will be recognized during asset impairment charges relating to the realignment included million for the closure of the columbus  ohio plant announced in december  including property  plant and equipment of million and goodwill of million  and million reflecting the write down of certain equipment and our remaining investment in an equity investee 
we also recorded an impairment loss of million with respect to customer relationships 
as a result of declining sales and margins relating to certain customers we reviewed related long lived assets for impairment 
this review indicated that the customer relationship assets were impaired and as a result the carrying value was written down to its estimated fair value 
other other unusual items of million in relate primarily to the million in legal fees for the oft and competition commission reviews of the macaw acquisition in the uk and million in other asset impairments in the corporate and other segment 
operating income operating income was million in including unusual items of million  as compared with million in which included unusual items of million 
interest expense net interest expense was million in  up from million in the increase was primarily due to higher borrowings on our credit facilities during the year to finance the macaw acquisition 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of as compared with million  or an effective rate of  in the effective tax rate increase is largely due to our inability to recognize the tax benefit of our losses in canada 
a reduction in reserves of million partially offset the million valuation allowance recorded for canadian tax losses 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operating activities in was million  after capital expenditures of million  as compared to in which cash provided by operating activities was million after capital expenditures of million 
we use cash flow from operating activities after capital expenditures to measure cash we are able to generate after considering the investments required to maintain or expand our capital base 
it is defined as follows cash provided by operating activities additions to property  plant equipment cash flow from operations after capital expenditures cash flow from operations after capital expenditures increased slightly in despite a million increase in capital spending as net working capital increased by million in compared with the million increase in at the end of  accounts receivable were high as a result of supplier rebates not collected until january and inventories were adversely impacted by plant inefficiencies  poor forecasting and inventory build up for january promotions 
in  increases in accounts receivable and inventory are more reflective of the changes in sales and costs 
accounts payable levels are higher in primarily as a result of the capacity additions in north america 
investing activities capital expenditures our capital expenditures were million in as compared with million in major capital expenditures include million on leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment  primarily in the north america  as we added capacity to support future growth 
we completed construction on a new beverage manufacturing facility in fort worth  texas and began shipping from this location in june the total cost of the fort worth plant was million  including million spent in acquisitions we completed the macaw acquisition in august the purchase price of the acquisition was million million pounds sterling including acquisition costs of million million pounds sterling 
the acquisition was financed under our global credit facilities  which were increased from million to million in connection with this transaction 
in march  we acquired certain of the assets of cardinal 
the acquisition added carbonated soft drink sales and manufacturing capacity in north america 
the total purchase price was million and was funded from cash flow from operations and short term borrowings 
in october  we purchased certain of the assets of metro 
the total purchase price was million and was funded from cash flow from operations and short term borrowings 
the total cost of these acquisitions in was million including acquisition costs of million 
capacity additions in october  we purchased the plant and equipment of elan waters in blairsville  georgia for million to add to our production capacity in north america 
the purchase was funded from short term borrowings 
other investing activities other investing activities relate primarily to additions to information technology assets included in intangibles and other assets 
we made progress in implementing our standardized information system during and expect to complete the roll out in capital resources and debt our sources of capital include operating cash flows  short term borrowings under current credit facilities  issuance of public debt and issuance of equity securities 
management believes we have adequate financial resources to meet our ongoing cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures  as well as our other financial obligations based on our operating cash flows and current available credit 
senior secured credit facility on march  we entered into a committed senior secured credit facility for financing in north america  the uk and mexico 
the facilities replaced our former committed senior secured credit facility in north america and our demand bank credit facility in the uk the facilities terminate  and the debt under the senior secured credit agreement is due  on march  these multicurrency facilities were amended on august  to increase the facilities to million from million to add macaw soft drinks limited as a co borrower  to consent to the macaw acquisition and to increase the maximum facility amount to million 
the amended facilities allow for revolving credit borrowings in a principal amount of up to million  provided we are in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the agreements  and are comprised of two separate facilities a million multicurrency facility made by certain lenders to us and our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  cott beverages inc  macaw soft drinks limited and cott beverages limited as co borrowers  and a million mexican facility made by the lender to our indirect owned subsidiary cott embotelladores de mexico  sa de sa cemsa 
each facility includes subfacilities for swingline loans and letters of credit 
the million facility can be increased up to an additional million at our option if the lenders agree to increase their commitments or new lenders join the facility and we satisfy certain conditions 
within the million of extra availability  and subject to certain limitations  we can establish additional revolving credit facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed million to be provided in various currencies as agreed upon for additional subsidiaries designated by us 
wachovia bank  national associations acts as administrative agent and security trustee under the facilities 
the facilities are collateralized by substantially all our personal property with certain exceptions including the receivables sold as part of our receivables securitization facility discussed below 
in general  borrowings under these facilities bear interest at either a floating or fixed rate for the applicable currency plus a margin based on our consolidated total leverage ratio 
a facility fee of between and per annum is payable on the entire line of credit 
the level of the facility fee is dependent on financial covenants 
as of december  credit of million was available after borrowings of million  comprised of million and million pounds sterling  and standby letters of credit of million 
the weighted average interest rate was on these facilities as of december  securitizations in april our principal us operating subsidiaries entered into a receivables securitization facility under which they agreed to sell substantially all of their receivables generated from their ordinary course operations  as well as certain related assets  to a new special purpose indirect subsidiary  cott usa receivables corporation  which in turn sells and assigns undivided interests in the receivables and related assets to an unaffiliated entity  park avenue receivables company  llc and certain other financial institutions in exchange for cash in amounts determined by the parties  subject to specified conditions 
the transfers to the purchasers are treated as a financing for purposes of our consolidated financial statements  however  the presentation of consolidated financial statements does not itself imply that the assets of any consolidated entity  including any special purpose entity formed for a particular project  are available to pay the liabilities of any other consolidated entity  or that the liabilities of any consolidated entity  including any special purpose entity formed for a particular project  are obligations of any other consolidated entity 
the transfers of the receivables and related assets to the purchasers are governed by a receivables purchase agreement  dated april   by and among cott usa receivables corporation  cott beverages inc  the purchasers and jpmorgan chase bank  na  acting for itself and the purchasers 
the agreement contains representations  warranties  covenants  and indemnities customary for facilities of this type 
the facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining our activities or  except for cott usa receivables corporation  the activities of our subsidiaries 
the amount of funds available under the receivables facility is based upon the amount of eligible receivables and various reserves required by the facility 
accordingly  availability may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivables balances and calculation of reserves  but will not exceed the million program limit 
this facility bears interest at a variable rate  based on the cost of borrowing of the purchasers 
a fee of between and per annum is payable on the unused portion of the facility 
the level of the facility fee is dependent on financial covenants 
as of december   million of eligible receivables  net of reserves  were available for purchase and million was outstanding under this facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
senior subordinated notes we also have outstanding senior subordinated notes  which are due in as of december   the principal amount of those notes was million 
the issuer of the notes is cott beverages inc  but we and most of our us  canadian and us subsidiaries guarantee the notes 
long term debt long term debt as of december  was million  compared with million at the end of long term debt in and consisted of senior subordinated notes with a stated face value of million and capital leases of million 
debt covenants our senior secured credit facility and the indenture respecting the notes contain a number of business and financial covenants and events of default that apply to the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries 
the restricted subsidiaries are  in general  the guarantor subsidiaries organized in canada  the us  the us and mexico 
among other events of default or triggers for prepayment in our credit facilities and indenture are a change of control of us in certain circumstances  cross default or cross acceleration to other indebtedness in excess of million  unsatisfied judgments in excess of million  our insolvency or that of the restricted subsidiaries  and covenant default under the indenture or credit facilities 
some of the more material business and financial covenants are discussed below 
our senior secured credit facility restricts additional indebtedness for subsidiaries to the existing debt and credit facilities  certain intercompany debt  million of purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations  million of guarantee obligations and a million basket of other additional indebtedness 
the senior secured credit facility contains restrictions on investments  including investments in subsidiaries outside of the us  canada or the us  and acquisitions 
in general  individual acquisitions are permitted up to million with the aggregate expenditure for all acquisitions limited to million in any fiscal year 
there is also a restriction on disposition of assets having a fair market value exceeding million in a fiscal year with certain specified exemptions 
dividends are currently limited to of consolidated net income for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter but that amount increases to of consolidated net income for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter if the leverage ratio is below to capital stock purchases are limited to million during the term of this credit facility 
there are further restrictions in several of the covenants  such as a complete prohibition on paying any dividends  if we are in default under the senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  many of the covenants effectively limit transactions with our unrestricted subsidiaries or non guarantor entities 
in addition to business covenants  there are financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility 
since march   our total leverage ratio was required to be no more than to and that requirement is tightened to to from july  at the end of  our leverage ratio was to the senior secured credit facility also has a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
from march   our fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be at least to and july  it must be at least to and after july  it must be at least to as of december  it was to the indenture for the notes also has numerous covenants that are applicable to cott beverages inc  the restricted subsidiaries and us 
we can only make restricted payments  such as paying dividends  buying back stock or making certain investments  if our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least to even then  we can only make those restricted payments in an amount that is no greater than of our consolidated net income subject to certain adjustments 
certain other investments  like those not exceeding million in the aggregate  may be made without satisfying the restricted payments test 
we can only incur additional debt or issue preferred stock  other than certain specified debt  if our fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to for purposes of the indenture  our fixed charge coverage ratio was to as of december  subject to some exceptions  asset sales may only be made where the sale price is equal to the fair market value of the asset sold and we receive at least of the proceeds in cash 
there are also limitations on what we may do with the sale proceeds such that we may be required to pay down debt or reinvest the proceeds in enumerated business uses within a specified period of time 
there are further restrictions in several of the covenants  such as a complete prohibition on paying any dividends  if we are in default under the indenture 
many of the covenants also effectively limit transactions with our unrestricted subsidiaries or non guarantor entities 
several of the terms  such as restricted payments  are defined differently in the indenture and the senior secured credit facility and certain calculations are made differently in the two agreements 
we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility under the terms of our indebtedness to operate our business as currently planned 
capital structure in  shareowner s equity increased by million from shareowners equity increased as a result of net income of million  additional share capital of million from the exercise of employee stock options  including the related tax benefit  and the million reduction in the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges 
these increases were partially offset by a million foreign currency translation loss on the net assets of self sustaining foreign operations 
the foreign currency translation adjustment resulted from the net changes in the pound sterling and the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
dividend payments no dividends were paid in and we are not expecting to change this policy in as we intend to use cash for future growth or debt repayment 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends under our credit facility and notes indenture 
the most restrictive provision is the quarterly limitation of dividends based on the prior quarter s earnings 
contractual obligations the following chart shows the schedule of future payments under certain contracts  including long term debt agreements and guarantees as of december  payments due by period less than years years after total year years in millions notes operating leases capital lease purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of an information technology outsourcing contract  contracts with certain co packers and commitments for the purchase of inventory and capital expenditures 
these obligations represent expected expenditures under the normal course of business  not our minimum contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  the advice of external experts or on other assumptions management believes to be reasonable 
where actuals differ from estimates  revisions are included in the results of the period in which actuals become known 
historically  differences between estimates and actuals have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements are discussed with our audit committee as they are implemented and on an annual basis and include the following revenue recognition we report sales when ownership passes to customers for products manufactured in our own plants and or by third parties on our behalf 
we regularly evaluate the facts and circumstances in relation to the criteria in the eitf and use our best judgment to determine whether to report sales on a gross or net basis for products manufactured by third parties 
currently  the facts and circumstances surrounding all of our business support the reporting of all sales on a gross basis 
we offer sales incentives to certain customers 
we account for these incentives as a reduction in sales 
we follow the guidance under eitf in accounting for sales incentives 
where the incentive has been paid in advance  we amortize the amount based on expected future sales related to the incentive 
where the incentive is to be paid in arrears  we accrue the amount based on expected future sales related to the incentive 
impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard sfas in  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
we have goodwill of million and rights of million on our balance sheet at december  in accordance with sfas  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
the evaluation of goodwill for each reporting unit is based upon the following approach 
we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any of the remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine the impairment loss 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted future cash flow 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the long term growth assumptions incorporated into the discounted cash flow calculation reflect our long term view of the market and the discount rate is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
based on the evaluation performed this year  we determined that the fair values of our reporting units  except for our columbus  ohio plant  exceeded their carrying value and that as a result the second step of the impairment test was not required 
we performed an impairment test on the value of the goodwill relating to our columbus  ohio plant as a result of its announced closure 
the impairment charge of million relating to this goodwill has been included in unusual items 
our only intangible asset with an indefinite life relates to our acquisition of intellectual property from royal crown company  inc including the right to manufacture our concentrates  with all related inventions  processes  technologies  technical and manufacturing information and know how 
there is an indefinite life to our ownership of these rights  and there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that limit the useful life 
in accordance with sfas  based on the above factors  the life of the rights is considered to be indefinite and they are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment 
impairment of an intangible asset with an indefinite life  if any  is determined using the same discounted future cash flow assumptions and model discussed above for goodwill 
we compare the carrying value of the rights to their fair value and recognize in income any impairment in value 
other intangible assets other intangible assets consist principally of customer relationships that arise from acquisitions  which amounted to million at december  customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis for the period over which we expect to receive economic benefits 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically compare the carrying value of long lived assets  including customer relationships by customer  to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows at the lowest level of independent cash flows for the group of long lived assets and recognize any impairment in our income statement 
the expected life and value of these long lived assets is based on an evaluation of the competitive environment  history and future prospects as appropriate 
in  we recorded impairment losses of million relating to customer relationships and million relating to long lived assets of our columbus  ohio and lachine  quebec facilities in unusual items 
income taxes we regularly review the recognized and unrecognized deferred income tax assets to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is required 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in respect of canada will not be realized and has recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of million in a reduction in reserves of million partially offset the increase in the valuation allowance 
all other deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of anticipated future taxable income from these operations 
the remaining deferred tax assets of million relate primarily to the united states 
a significant change in the volumes or profitability of these operations could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets 
we periodically review exposures and make our best estimate of the reserve amount 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into transactions where the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain 
these uncertainties require us to make estimates of the ultimate tax liabilities and  accordingly  the provision for income taxes 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate  additional income tax provisions may result if tax matters are resolved or settled at amounts different from those estimates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december the financial accounting standard s board fasb issued sfas r  share based payments  requiring companies to recognize compensation expense for all types of stock options 
we will adopt this standard using the modified prospective approach for as a result of this new standard  compensation expense for would have increased by million and income taxes would decrease by million 
comparative figures for the year ended december  would show income before income taxes and equity loss of million  income tax expense of million and net income of million or per basic share and fully diluted share 
in november fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads resulting from abnormally low production and certain other costs are to be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
we will adopt this standard for our interim period ending april  we do not expect this change to have a material impact on us 
canadian gaap results determined under canadian gaap may differ from results determined under us gaap from time to time 
under canadian gaap in  our net income would be million and total assets would be  million compared to net income and total assets under us gaap of million and  million  respectively 
under canadian gaap in  our net income would be million and total assets would be  million compared to net income and total assets under us gaap of million and  million  respectively 
there is one material us canadian gaap difference in and under canadian gaap  effective january   stock options issued to employees subsequent to january  are recognized in net income over the vesting period based on their fair value 
as a result  compensation expense of million  million after tax  was recorded in compensation expense of million  million after tax  was recorded for this policy was adopted on a retroactive basis with no restatement of comparative figures and as a result million was charged to opening retained earnings as at january  under us gaap  we have elected not to record compensation expense for options issued to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the common shares 
in  we will adopt sfas r which requires recognition of compensation expense relating to stock options 
versus our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december each year 
as a result  a rd week is included in our fiscal year every five or six years 
the fiscal year that ended january  consisted of weeks

total case volume in ounce equivalents for was  million  up from  million in in north america  our sales were  million in  an increase of from or excluding the extra week in when also excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange  sales increased from the growth was driven by increased volume with existing customers in the us  introduction of new products and sales to new customers partially offset by overall weak demand for carbonated soft drinks in canadian grocery stores 
in the uk and europe  our sales were million in  an increase of from million in excluding the impact of the strengthened pound sterling and the extra week in  sales increased in the increase was due to continued focus on core products  manufacturing for non retailer third parties  partnering with key suppliers  optimizing manufacturing processes and warehouse logistics and introducing new products 
the international segment includes the mexican operations  the royal crown international division and our business in asia 
sales by this segment were million in  an increase of when compared with sales of million in excluding foreign exchange and the extra week in  sales increased 
the increase in sales is primarily due to sales in mexico where sales were million  an increase of from million in cost of sales cost of sales was  million or of sales in as compared with  million or of sales in the increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from reduced plant efficiencies and higher logistics costs as we struggled to meet increased demand during the first half of higher commodity costs including resin for pet bottles and aluminum for cans 
variable costs represented of total cost of sales in major elements of these variable costs included ingredient and packaging costs  fees paid to third party manufacturers and distribution costs 
gross profit gross profit was of sales for compared with in lower margins resulted primarily from reduced plant efficiencies and higher logistics costs 
higher commodity costs were largely offset by price increases charged to our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a was million in  an increase of million or from million in increases in sg a include costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance  provisions taken during the year to write off certain export receivables in north america  adding new employees principally to serve our growing north american business  and a negative impact from the weakened us dollar 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation 
unusual items unusual items of million in and million in are primarily related to write downs to our investment in an equity investee 
operating income operating income was million in as compared with million for interest expense net interest expense was million in  down from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings on our credit facilities during the year 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of 
this decreased from million  or an effective rate of  in primarily due to a change in management s best estimate of the reserve 
canadian gaap results reported under canadian gaap may differ from results reported under us gaap from time to time 
under canadian gaap in  we reported net income of million and total assets of million compared to net income and total assets reported under us gaap of million and million  respectively 
there are no material us canadian gaap differences for outlook we expect to be another challenging year 
the carbonated soft drinks industry is expected to be flat in compared with as the decline in sales of regular csds is offset by higher sales of diet csds 
strong growth is expected for bottled water and non carbonated beverages 
to be successful  we will need to take a more disciplined  strategic approach to pricing  work to strategically reduce costs  aggressively improve the efficiency of our overall supply chain including bottled water profitability and increase our penetration into the non carbonated beverages category 
we intend to raise prices to recover all raw material cost increases and  over the next months  implement incremental pricing to recover the gap between cost and pricing increases 
we continue to move forward on the north american realignment plan we announced in september we are leveraging management strengths across a broader territory and maximizing opportunities and processes to improve supply chain efficiencies and financial performance 
we have improved asset efficiencies and made tough decisions to close certain operations and better align resources with customer needs 
to date  we have recorded charges of million relating to this plan and million for customer relationship impairment and could incur additional pre tax charges  including asset impairments  severance and other costs  of to million 
we have not completed the detailed plans and the requisite analyses to estimate the remaining charges to specific categories 
as a result  the ultimate amount and timing of the charges is uncertain 
we continue to strategically realign our asset base to improve our efficiencies and reduce fixed costs 
we are also looking into opportunities such as expanded in house pet blow moulding capabilities and dedicated high speed water lines to improve the profitability of bottled water 
our longer term priority is to position ourselves for growth in the non carbonated beverages category 
we will evaluate opportunities to increase our penetration in fast growing segments such as isotonics  enhanced or fortified drinks  energy and juice based beverages 
our business strategy also involves continuing to expand outside of north america 
we continue to view mexico as a strong long term growth opportunity and are working closely with our customers to grow the retailer brand beverage segment in this market 
the uk business intends to continue to enhance its performance through product innovation and a customer centric focus to identify opportunities 
the macaw acquisition has added additional production capacity and aseptic beverage capabilities to our uk business unit 
subsequent to the completion of the macaw acquisition  the oft in the uk decided to review the transaction 
under applicable uk law  we were not required to seek pre clearance of the macaw acquisition by the oft 
however  the oft has referred the transaction to the competition commission for further investigation 
the competition commission ruling is expected in may we expect that the transaction will be approved  but we cannot guarantee this outcome 
however  until a ruling is made  the oft and competition commission have required us to refrain from further integrating the macaw business into the cott business in the uk we expect net income to be substantially below the level as  along with charges for unusual items and compensation expense for stock options resulting from the implementation of sfas r  we will have higher depreciation expense from capacity additions and the macaw acquisition  increased interest expense from the macaw acquisition and a higher effective tax rates mainly due to our inability to record tax benefits on losses in canada 
the actions we have outlined will take time to implement 
we are moving forward in an urgent yet disciplined way and are working to position cott for long term success 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operations outside of the us accounted for approximately of sales and of sales  and are concentrated principally in the uk and canada 
our debt instruments  excluding debt of million million pounds sterling related to the macaw acquisition and the uk operations  are denominated in uk dollars 
we translate the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations using average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates among the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and pound sterling at current levels of foreign debt and operations could be material to our financial condition and profitability 
in  we entered into cash flow hedges to mitigate exposure to declines in the value of the canadian dollar and pound sterling attributable to certain forecasted us dollar raw material purchases of the canadian and us and european business segments 
the hedges consist of monthly foreign exchange options to buy us dollars at fixed rates per canadian dollar and mature at various dates through december  the fair market value of the foreign exchange options is included in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the instruments are cash flow hedges under sfas  accordingly  changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge instruments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and prepaid expenses and other assets are recorded in earnings in the same periods in which the forecasted purchases or payments affect earnings

we regularly review the structure of our indebtedness and consider changes to the proportion of floating versus fixed rate debt through refinancing  interest rate swaps or other measures in response to the changing economic environment 
historically  we have not used derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk 
if we use and fail to manage these derivative instruments successfully  or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or otherwise increase our debt capacity in response to changes in the marketplace  the expense associated with debt service could increase 
this would negatively impact our financial condition and profitability
