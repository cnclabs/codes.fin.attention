the company has not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements which would be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect  such as obligations under certain guarantees or contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements  obligations under certain derivative arrangements  and obligations under material variable interests 
credit cards prior to april   the company s proprietary credit cards were issued by national bank of the great lakes nbgl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
on april   the company sold its proprietary credit card portfolio  consisting of the proprietary credit card accounts owned by nbgl and the company s ownership interest in the assets of the trust to household bank sb  na now hsbc bank nevada  na  hsbc  a third party financial institution 
in connection with the sale  the company received an amount in cash equal to the difference of the sum of of the outstanding accounts receivable balances  a premium  and the value of investments held in securitization accounts minus the outstanding principal balance  together with unpaid accrued interest  of specified certificates held by public investors  which certificates were assumed by hsbc at the closing 
the company s net cash proceeds from the transaction were approximately million 
after allocating the cash proceeds to the sold accounts  the retained interest in the securitized receivables  and an ongoing program agreement  the company realized a gain of approximately million 
the cash proceeds allocated to the ongoing program agreement were deferred and will be reflected as a reimbursement of continuing credit card related expenses over the life of the agreement 
as part of the transaction  for a term of ten years expiring in and pursuant to a program agreement  hsbc established and owns proprietary credit card accounts for customers of the company s operating subsidiaries  retains the benefits and risks associated with the ownership of the accounts  receives the finance charge income and incurs the bad debts associated with those accounts 
during the ten year term  pursuant to a servicing agreement  the company continues to provide key customer service functions  including new account opening  transaction authorization  billing adjustments and customer inquiries  and receives compensation from hsbc for these services

index to financial statements at the end of the ten year term expiring in  the agreement can be renewed for two two year terms 
at the end of the agreement  the company has the right to repurchase  at fair value  all of the accounts and outstanding accounts receivable  negotiate a new agreement with hsbc or begin issuing private label credit cards itself or through others 
the agreement allows the company to terminate the agreement early following the incurrence of certain events  the most significant of which would be hsbc s failure to pay owed amounts  bankruptcy  a change in control or a material adverse change in hsbc s ability to perform under the agreement 
the agreement also allows for hsbc to terminate the agreement if the company fails to pay owed amounts or enters bankruptcy 
should either the company or hsbc choose to terminate the agreement early  the company has the right  but not the requirement  to repurchase the credit card accounts and associated accounts receivable from hsbc at their fair value 
the company is contingently liable to pay monies to hsbc in the event of an early termination or a significant disposition of stores 
the contingent payment is based upon a declining portion of an amount established at the beginning of the ten year agreement and on a prorated portion of significant store closings 
because hsbc acknowledged that each of bon ton and belk entered into an agreement with hsbc with respect to the credit card accounts and associated accounts receivable at ndsg and proffitt s  respectively  that satisfied certain requirements in the company s agreement with hsbc  this contingent payment was not applicable to the sales of ndsg and proffitt s 
the maximum contingent payment had the agreement been terminated early at january  would have been approximately million 
management believes the risk of incurring a contingent payment is remote 
capital needs the company estimates capital expenditures for will approximate million to million  net of anticipated proceeds of million  primarily for the construction of new stores opening in  initial construction work on stores expected to open in  store expansions and renovations  enhancements to management information systems  maintenance capital and replacement capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that working capital requirements related to new and existing stores and capital expenditures will be funded through cash on hand  cash provided by operations and the revolving credit agreement 
maximum availability under the revolving credit agreement is million 
there is no debt rating trigger 
during periods in which availability under the agreement exceeds million  the company is not subject to financial covenants 
if availability under the agreement were to decrease to less than million  the company would be subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to during  weighted average borrowings and letters of credit issued under this credit agreement were million 
the highest amount of borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the agreement during was million 
the company expects to generate adequate cash flows from operating activities combined with borrowings under its revolving credit agreement in order to sustain its current levels of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition sales and the related gross margin are recorded at the time customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take ownership of the merchandise 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties 
table of contents 
index to financial statements affecting the application of this policy 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns are effected within a matter of days of the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation  excluding depreciation and amortization the company s inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale at too high a level  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or overly conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when the vendor provides support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction to cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction in cost purchases 
credit card income and expenses following the sale of the company s proprietary credit card business in april  the company no longer maintains a retained interest in the credit card receivables 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the accounting for the credit card program compensation  credit card servicing compensation and servicing expenses 
initial proceeds allocated to the program and servicing agreement are being amortized into income ratably over the lives of the agreement 
ongoing income associated with honoring the credit cards under the program agreement  promoting the credit cards and servicing the credit cards is recognized monthly contemporaneous with providing these services 
prior to the sale  the carrying value of the company s retained interest in credit card receivables required a substantial amount of management judgment and estimates 
at the time credit card receivables were sold to third party investors through the securitization program  generally accepted accounting principles required that the company recognize a gain or loss equal to the excess of the estimated fair value of the consideration to be received from the individual interest sold over the cost of the receivables sold 
as the receivables were collected  the estimated gains and losses were reconciled to the actual gains and losses 
given that the company generated credit card receivables of approximately billion per year and average outstanding sold receivables were generally billion to billion  a substantial majority of the annual estimated credit gains and losses had 
table of contents 
index to financial statements been reconciled to actual gains and losses 
only that portion of the gains and losses attributable to the outstanding securitized portfolio at year end remained subject to estimating risk 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 
depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over one half of the company s assets at january  are represented by investments in property  equipment and goodwill 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
the company principally utilizes the straight line depreciation method and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets is considered 
when constructing stores  the company receives allowances from landlords 
if the landlord is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the property  then the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered to be a deferred rent liability  whereas the corresponding capital expenditures related to that store are considered to be prepaid rent 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing and  absent certain events  annually 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates  inflation and store expenses 
during  the company recorded million in impairment charges in the normal course of business primarily associated with stores in which the estimated discounted cash flows would not recover the carrying value of the store assets 
the company 
table of contents 
index to financial statements recorded a million gain associated with the sale of proffitt s 
in addition  sfae recorded a million gain associated with store closings 
there are other stores in which current cash flows are not adequate to recover the carrying value of the store assets 
however  the company believes that estimated sales growth and gross margin improvement will enhance the cash flows of these stores such that the carrying value of the store assets will be recovered 
generally these stores were recently opened and require a two to five year period to develop the customer base to attain the required cash flows 
to the extent management s estimates for sales growth and gross margin improvement are not realized  future annual assessments could result in impairment charges 
goodwill and intangibles the company has allocated the purchase price of previous purchase transactions to identifiable tangible assets and liabilities based on estimates of their fair values and identifiable intangible assets  with the remainder allocated to goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the discontinuation of goodwill amortization and the periodic testing at least annually for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
at each year end balance sheet date and as changes in circumstances arise  the company performs an evaluation of the recoverability of its sdsg goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount of its assets and goodwill 
as a result  in the company recorded a charge of million due to the impairment of sdsg goodwill 
the company also disposed of approximately million of goodwill during related to the sale of proffitt s 
leases the company leases stores  distribution centers  and administrative facilities under operating leases 
store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
most of the company s lease agreements include renewal periods at the company s option 
the company recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the company takes possession of the leased space and includes such rent expense in store pre opening costs 
the company records tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company records rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s deferred tax assets at january  consist of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and during the valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards was reduced based on projections of future profitability which include a gain related to the sale of the ndsg business in at january  the company believes that it will be sufficiently profitable during the periods from to to utilize all of its federal nols and a significant portion of its state nols 
to the extent management s estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction are greater than or less than management s current estimates  future increases or decreases in the benefit for net operating losses could occur 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state and local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
audit authorities may question the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues charges for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements during  the company recorded a benefit of million related to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to certain tax examination periods which was recorded as a credit to shareholder s equity in accordance with sop in addition  an increase to the reserve for tax exposures of million was recorded as an income tax expense for additional exposures 
during  the company concluded a federal income tax examination for the and tax years on terms favorable to previously accrued exposures associated with those tax years 
accordingly  the company decreased the amount previously accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
additionally  the company identified exposures related to state tax filing positions and determined the need to provide for additional reserves 
the net effect of this federal and state reserve adjustment resulted in an income tax benefit of million and a credit to shareholders equity of million 
at january   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
at january   two of the company s three open tax years were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service and certain state examinations were ongoing as well 
pension plans pension expense is based on information provided by outside actuarial firms that use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to associates and allocates this cost to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
the pension plans are valued annually on november st 
the projected unit credit method is utilized in recognizing the pension liabilities 
pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates  after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries  as of the annual measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based upon pension discount curves and bond portfolio curves over a duration similar to the plan s liabilities as of the measurement date 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the company s pension obligation  which is represented by the accumulated benefit obligation abo and the projected benefit obligation pbo and in calculating net pension expense 
at november   the discount rate was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s abo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is million on the abo and million on annual pension expense 
to the extent the abo increases  the after tax effect of such increase serves to reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the pbo 
it is the company s policy to invest approximately of the pension fund assets in equities  in fixed income securities and in real estate 
this expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on the advice of the company s outside investment advisors 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately to years 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is likewise not affected 
rather  this loss increases pension expense over approximately to years 
during and  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the assumed average rate of compensation increases is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
this rate is estimated to be for the periods following november  and is utilized principally in calculating the pbo and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a change in the assumed rate of compensation increases would not be material to the pbo or annual pension expense 
at november   the company had unrecognized pension expense of million related to the expected return on assets exceeding actual investment returns  actual compensation increases exceeding assumed average rate of compensation and plan amendments  contributions subsequent to the measurement date and other differences between underlying actuarial assumptions and actual results 
this delayed recognition of expense is incorporated into the million underfunded status of the plans at november  in january and january  the company voluntarily contributed thousand and thousand  respectively  to the plan to reduce underfunding 
the company expects minimal funding requirements in and inflation and deflation inflation and deflation affect the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its sg a expenses 
the company attempts to offset the effects of inflation  which has occurred in recent years in sg a  through price increases and control of expenses  although the company s ability to increase prices is limited by competitive factors in its markets 
the company attempts to offset the effects of merchandise deflation  which has occurred in recent years  through control of expenses 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with a significant portion of net sales and net income realized during the second half of the fiscal year  which includes the holiday selling season 
in light of these patterns  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first three fiscal quarters of each year  and working capital needs are greater in the last two fiscal quarters of each year 
the increases in working capital needs during the fall season have typically been financed with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
generally  more than of the company s net sales and substantially all of net income are generated during the fourth fiscal quarter 
new accounting pronouncements during  the eitf reached a consensus  eitf  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  whereby the contingent conversion provisions should be ignored and therefore an issuer should apply the if converted method in calculating dilutive earnings per share 
this consensus became effective for periods ending after december   and requires retroactive application to all periods presented 
furthermore  the fasb is contemplating an amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  that would require the company to ignore the cash presumption of net share settlement and to assume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share 
although the company is now required to ignore the contingent conversion provision on its convertible notes under eitf  it can still presume that it will satisfy the net share settlement upon conversion of the notes in cash  and thus exclude the effect of the conversion of the notes in its calculation of dilutive earnings per share 
if and when the fasb amends sfas no 
 the effect of the changes would require the company to use the if converted method in calculating dilutive earnings per share except when the effect would be anti dilutive 
the effect of adopting the amendment to sfas no 
would increase the number of shares in the company s dilutive calculation by  shares
