table of contents december in thousands commercial and agricultural consumer and installment real estate mortgage lease financing other total gross loans maturity distribution of loans and leases the maturity distribution of the bank s loan portfolio is one factor in management s evaluation by collateral type of the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio

the bank attempts to manage the relationship between the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to produce an effective interest differential that is not significantly impacted by the level of interest rates 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s loans and leases net of unearned income as of december  fixed variable rate rate in thousands loan and lease portfolio due after one year non accrual  past due and restructured loans and leases non performing loans and leases consist of both non accrual loans and leases and loans and leases that have been restructured primarily in the form of reduced interest rates because of the borrower s weakened financial condition 
the bank s non performing loans and leases were as follows at december for the years indicated 
table of contents december in thousands non accrual loans and leases loans and leases days or more past due restructured loans and leases total gross loans and leases the total amount of interest earned on non performing loans and leases was approximately     and  in    and  respectively 
the gross interest income that would have been recorded under the original terms of those loans and leases amounted to     and  in    and  respectively 
loans considered impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure  are loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the bank s recorded investment in loans considered impaired at december     and was     and  respectively  with a valuation allowance of     and  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during    and was     and  respectively 
the bank s policy provides that loans and leases are generally placed in non accrual status if  in management s opinion  payment in full of principal or interest is not expected or payment of principal or interest is more than days past due  unless the loan or lease is both well secured and in the process of collection 
in the normal course of business  management becomes aware of possible credit problems in which borrowers exhibit potential for the inability to comply with the contractual terms of their loans and leases  but which do not currently meet the criteria for disclosure as non performing loans and leases 
historically  some of these loans and leases are ultimately restructured or placed in non accrual status 
at december   no single loan or lease of material significance was known to be potential non performing loans and leases 
at december   the bank did not have any concentration of loans in excess of of total loans and leases outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
however  the bank does conduct business in a geographically concentrated area 
the ability of the bank s borrowers to repay loans is to some extent dependent upon the economic conditions prevailing in the bank s market area 
the bank automatically extended loan payment dates for customers in the hurricane affected area 
the bank has not quantified the impact on non performing loans of extending loan payment dates for these customers 
summary of credit loss experience in the normal course of business  the bank assumes risks in extending credit 
the bank manages these risks through its lending policies  loan review procedures and the diversification of its loan portfolio 
although it is not possible to predict credit losses with certainty  management regularly reviews the characteristics of the loan portfolio to determine its overall risk profile and quality 
attention is paid to the quality of the loan portfolio through a formal loan review process 
the board of directors of the bank has appointed a loan loss reserve valuation committee the loan loss committee that is responsible for ensuring that the allowance for credit losses provides coverage of both known and inherent losses 
the loan loss committee considers estimates of loss for individually analyzed credits as well as factors such as historical experience  changes in economic and business conditions and concentrations of risk in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses 
the loan loss committee meets at least quarterly to determine the amount of adjustments to the allowance for credit losses 
the loan loss committee is composed of senior management from the bank s loan administration  lending and finance departments 
in each period  the loan loss committee bases the allowance for credit losses on its loan classification system as well as an analysis of general economic and

the breakdown of the allowance by loan category is based in part on evaluations of specific loans past history and on economic conditions within specific industries or geographical areas

the distribution and market share of deposits by type of deposit and by type of depositor are important considerations in the company s assessment of the stability of its funds sources and its access to additional funds

certain statements contained in this annual report may not be based on historical facts and are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act  as amended 
these forward looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period s or by the use of forward looking terminology  such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  foresee  may  might  will  would  could or intend  future or conditional verb tenses  and variations or negatives of such terms

we caution you not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this annual report in that actual results could differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements due to a variety of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of economic recovery in the areas affected by hurricane katrina  the ability of the company to increase noninterest revenue and expand noninterest revenue business  changes in economic conditions and government fiscal and monetary policies  fluctuations in prevailing interest rates and the effectiveness of the company s interest rate hedging strategies  the ability of the company to maintain credit quality  the ability of the company to provide and market competitive products and services  changes in the company s operating or expansion strategy  geographic concentration of the company s assets and susceptibility to economic downturns in that area  the availability of and costs associated with maintaining and or obtaining adequate and timely sources of liquidity  laws and regulations affecting financial institutions in general  the ability of the company to operate and integrate new technology  the ability of the company to manage its growth and effectively serve an expanding customer and market base  the ability of the company to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  changes in consumer preferences  the ability of the company to repurchase its common stock on favorable terms  the ability of the company to collect amounts due under loan agreements and attract deposits  legislation and court decisions related to the amount of damages recoverable in legal proceedings  possible adverse rulings  judgments  settlements and other outcomes of pending litigation  and other factors generally understood to affect the financial results of financial services companies  the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report 
in addition to the factors listed above that could influence our forward looking statements  management believes that the risk factors set forth below should be considered in evaluating the company s business 
other relevant risk factors are outlined below and may be supplemented from time to time in the company s press releases and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
rising interest rates may result in higher interest rates being paid on interest bearing deposits than are charged on outstanding loans 
if interest rates rise  we may pay interest on our customers interest bearing deposits and our other liabilities at higher rates than the interest rates paid to us by our customers on outstanding loans that were made when interest rates were at a lower level 
this situation would result in a negative interest rate spread with respect to those loans and cause an adverse effect on our earnings 
this adverse effect would increase if interest rates continued to rise while we had outstanding loans payable at fixed interest rates that could not be adjusted to a higher interest rate 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors 
if our assumptions are wrong  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses  which would have an adverse effect on our operating results  and may also cause us to increase the allowance in the future 
further  our net income would decrease for any period in which we add additional amounts to our allowance for loans losses 

table of contents hurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect local economies where we maintain branch offices or cause disruption or damage to our branch office locations  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
our operations include business in the states of mississippi  alabama  louisiana and texas  which includes areas susceptible to hurricanes or tropical storms 
such weather conditions can disrupt our operations  result in damage to our branch office locations or negatively affect the local economies in which we operate 
in late august  hurricane katrina devastated parts of the mississippi gulf coast  causing substantial damage to residences and businesses in these areas  including of our banking locations 
we cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future hurricanes or storms will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas  but such weather conditions could result in a decline in loan originations and an increase in the risk of delinquencies  foreclosures or loan losses 
our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of devastating hurricanes or storms 
our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation 
bancorpsouth  inc is a financial holding company under the bank holding company act  and bancorpsouth bank is a mississippi state banking corporation 
accordingly  both are subject to extensive governmental regulation  legislation and control 
these laws limit the manner in which we operate  including the amount of loans we can originate  interest we can charge on loans and fees we can charge for certain services 
we cannot predict whether  or the extent to which  the government and governmental organizations may change any of these laws or controls 
we also cannot predict how any of these changes would adversely affect our business and prospects 
we face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions 
we completed one acquisition in and  if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we intend to pursue additional acquisitions in the future that we believe are strategic 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully or integrate such acquisitions with our current business 
upon completion of an acquisition  we are faced with the challenges of integrating the operations  services  products  personnel  and systems of acquired companies into our business  which may divert management s attention from ongoing business operations 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in integrating any acquired business effectively into the operations of our business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized 
the success of our acquisitions is dependent on the continued employment of several key employees 
if acquired businesses do not meet projected revenue targets  or if certain key employees were to leave the businesses  we could conclude that the value of the businesses has decreased and that the related goodwill has been impaired 
if we were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
issuing additional shares of our common stock to acquire other banks  bank holding companies  financial holding companies and insurance agencies may result in dilution for existing shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
in connection with our growth strategy  we have issued  and may issue in the future  shares of our common stock to acquire additional banks  bank holding companies  financial holding companies and insurance agencies 
resales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market and the potential of such sales could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
we usually must pay an acquisition premium above the fair market value of acquired assets for the acquisition of banks  bank holding companies  financial holding companies and insurance agencies 
paying this acquisition premium  in addition to the dilutive effect of issuing additional shares  may also adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
our ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by law 
we derive our income solely from dividends received from owning the bank s common stock 
federal and state law limit the bank s ability to declare and pay dividends 
in addition  the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock 

table of contents our growth strategy includes risks that could have an adverse effect on financial performance 
a significant element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional banks  bank holding companies  financial holding companies and insurance agencies in order to achieve greater economies of scale 
we cannot assure you that the current level of growth opportunities will continue to exist  that we will be able to acquire banks  insurance agencies  bank holding companies and financial holding companies that satisfy our criteria or that any such acquisitions will be on terms favorable to us 
further  our growth strategy will require that we continue to hire qualified personnel  while concurrently expanding our managerial and operational infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to hire and retain qualified personnel or that we will be able to successfully expand our infrastructure to accommodate future acquisitions or growth 
as a result of these factors  we may not realize the expected economic benefits associated with our acquisitions 
this could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
diversification in types of financial services may adversely affect our financial performance 
as part of our business strategy  we may further diversify our lines of business into areas that are not traditionally associated with the banking business 
as a result  we would need to manage the development of new business lines in which we had not previously participated 
each new business line would require the investment of additional capital and the significant involvement of our senior management to develop and integrate the service subsidiaries with our traditional banking operations 
we can offer no assurances that we will be able to develop and integrate the new services without adversely affecting our financial performance 
monetary policies and economic factors may limit our ability to attract deposits or make loans 
the monetary policies of federal regulatory authorities  particularly the federal reserve  and economic conditions in our service area and the united states generally  affect our ability to attract deposits and extend loans 
we cannot predict either the nature and timing of any changes in these monetary policies and economic conditions  including the federal reserve s interest rate policies  or their impact on our financial performance 
the banking business is subject to various material business risks  which may become more acute in periods of economic slowdown or recession 
during such periods  foreclosures generally increase and such conditions could also lead to a potential decline in deposits and demand for loans 
we compete with other financial holding companies  bank holding companies  banks  insurance and financial services companies 
the banking business is extremely competitive in our service areas in mississippi  tennessee  alabama  arkansas  texas and louisiana 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with well established banks  credit unions  insurance agencies and other financial institutions  several of which have significantly greater resources and lending limits 
some of these competitors provide certain services that we do not provide 
anti takeover provisions may discourage a change of our control 
our governing documents and certain agreements to which we are a party contain several provisions which make a change in control difficult to accomplish  and may discourage a potential acquirer 
these include a shareholder rights plan  or poison pill  a classified or staggered board of directors  change in control agreements with members of management and supermajority voting requirements 
these anti takeover provisions may have an adverse effect on the market for our common stock 
failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements  providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization  and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements 
table of contents would be prevented or detected 
any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
our stock price may fluctuate 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
any announcement with respect to the banking industry  market conditions or any variance in our revenues or earnings from levels generally expected by securities analysts for a given period could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of our common stock 
in evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock  the factors set forth in this section should be carefully considered  along with other matters discussed in reports and other filings that we have made with the securities and exchange commission 
it should not be assumed that we have listed or described the only risks that could affect our future performance or the market price of our common stock

it leases nine offices that have unexpired terms varying in duration from one to nine years 

table of contents item legal proceedings 
the company and its subsidiaries are engaged in lines of business that are heavily regulated and involve a large volume of financial transactions with numerous customers through offices in six states 
although the company and its subsidiaries have developed policies and procedures to minimize the impact of legal noncompliance and other disputes  litigation presents an ongoing risk 
additionally  the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business  including claims against entities to which the company is a successor as a result of business combinations 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolutions of this category of claims should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
litigation is  however  inherently uncertain  and the company cannot make assurances that it will prevail in any of these actions  nor can it estimate with reasonable certainty the amount of damages that it might incur 
the state tax commission of the state of mississippi completed its audit of the bank s state income tax return for the tax years through in the second quarter of as a result of this audit  the state tax commission assessed the bank additional taxes of approximately million along with interest and penalties totaling approximately million 
based on the advice of legal counsel  management believes that there is no substantial basis for the position taken by the mississippi state tax commission and that the company has meritorious defenses to dispute this assessment of additional taxes 
the company is in the midst of the administrative appeals process and a final decision has not been rendered by the state tax commission 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in having the assessment reduced on appeal 
the company s potential exposure with regard to this assessment will be the additional tax  interest and penalties assessed in may plus interest that will continue to accrue from may through the appeals process and legal costs associated with the appeal 
management does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  although any significant additional assessment could materially adversely affect earnings in the period in which it is recorded

overview the company is a regional financial holding company with approximately billion in assets headquartered in tupelo  mississippi 
the company s wholly owned banking subsidiary has commercial banking operations in mississippi  tennessee  alabama  arkansas  texas and louisiana 
the bank and its consumer finance  credit insurance  insurance agency and brokerage subsidiaries provide commercial banking  leasing  mortgage origination and servicing  insurance  brokerage and trust services to corporate customers  local governments  individuals and other financial institutions through an extensive network of branches and offices 
management s discussion and analysis provides a narrative discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations for the previous three years 
for a complete understanding of the following discussion  you should refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes presented elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis is based on reported financial information  and certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current financial statement presentation 
the information that follows is 
table of contents provided to enhance comparability of financial information between years and to provide a better understanding of the company s operations 
as a financial holding company  the financial condition and operating results of the company are heavily influenced by economic trends nationally and in the specific markets in which the company s subsidiaries provide financial services 
most of the revenue of the company is derived from the operation of its principal operating subsidiary  the bank 
the financial condition and operating results of the bank are affected by the level and volatility of interest rates on loans  investment securities  deposits and other borrowed funds  and the impact of economic downturns on loan demand and creditworthiness of existing borrowers 
the financial services industry is highly competitive and heavily regulated 
the company s success depends on its ability to compete aggressively within its markets while maintaining sufficient asset quality and cost controls to generate net income 
during the third quarter of  a significant and unpredictable event occurred that had a material impact on the company s operating results 
hurricane katrina had a devastating impact on the mississippi gulf coast region 
the company operated banking locations along the mississippi gulf coast at the time of the hurricane and all of these locations were damaged  some more severely than others 
by the end of  only three branches and a loan production office had not reopened for business 
the company is currently evaluating the future of these branches 
approximately of the bank s loans and approximately of the bank s deposits were located in the mississippi gulf coast area at the time of the hurricane 
one of the agencies that comprises part of the company s insurance subsidiary is headquartered on the mississippi gulf coast and its operations were also impacted by the hurricane 
the agency s disaster recovery plan was quickly implemented and it was fully operational within a day of the hurricane  servicing its customers and processing claims 
the impact of hurricane katrina decreased the company s annual net income by approximately million  or per diluted share 
the reduced net income is a result of an increase in the provision for credit losses related to the hurricane  assistance for employees and others in the hurricane affected area and lost noninterest revenue  a significant portion of which resulted from the bank s waiver of certain fees and service charges for individuals and businesses in the hurricane affected area  with the decrease somewhat offset by receipt of hurricane related insurance proceeds 
the bank also extended loan payment dates for customers in the hurricane affected area 
these items are discussed in more detail in the appropriate sections that follow 
the continuing impact of the hurricane on the company s financial condition and results of operations may not be known for some time and must be measured by the extent of damage to the properties of the company s customers  including property pledged to the bank as collateral  the impact of government and other forms of assistance  the uncertainty regarding the expected rate of economic recovery in the region affected by hurricane katrina and the final settlement with the company s insurance carrier with respect to damage to the company s properties 
however  the company has seen a significant increase in deposits in its mississippi gulf coast offices as individuals and businesses received insurance proceeds related to damage caused by the hurricane 
also  the company anticipates that significant lending opportunities will develop as the rebuilding process gains momentum 
the table below summarizes the company s net income  net income per share  return on average assets and return on average shareholders equity for the years ended december   and management believes that these amounts and ratios are key indicators of the company s financial performance 
dollars in thousands  except per share amounts change change net income net income per share basic diluted return on average assets return on average shareholders equity the increase in the company s net income for when compared to was primarily attributable to the increase in its net interest revenue 
the primary source of revenue for the company is the amount of net interest revenue earned by the bank 
net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other obligations 
net interest revenue for was million  compared to million for and million for net interest revenue is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s long term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to 
table of contents maximize net interest revenue  while balancing interest rate  credit  liquidity and capital risks 
in  the company s net interest revenue was positively impacted by increases in interest rates as well as the increased loan demand resulting from favorable economic activity throughout most of the bank s markets and the company s continued focus on funding this growth with maturing investment securities and lower cost liabilities 
in recent years  the company has taken steps to diversify its revenue stream by increasing the amount of revenue received from mortgage lending operations  insurance agency activities  brokerage and securities activities and other activities that generate fee income 
management believes this diversification is important to reduce the impact of fluctuations in net interest revenue on the overall operating results of the company 
noninterest revenue for was million  compared to million for and million in noninterest revenue in was positively impacted by the million gain from insurance proceeds relating to hurricane katrina 
the increase was also the result of increases in insurance commissions and brokerage activities in as compared to and both and noninterest revenue reflected decreases in mortgage lending as reflected record levels of mortgage loan originations for the company as a result of the historically low mortgage loan interest rates during while service charges reflected a slight increase for  service charge revenue was negatively impacted by the company s waiver of certain fees and service charges for people and businesses in the areas affected by hurricane katrina 
improved asset quality allowed net charge offs to fall to of average loans during from of average loans in and of average loans in noninterest expense for was million  an increase of from million for which was an increase of from million for the increase in noninterest expense primarily resulted from additional salaries and employee benefits associated with the acquisitions of three banks since late december and increased occupancy costs from opening new offices during as the company continued to reinvest by expanding its branch and atm networks while systems and operational consolidation efforts continued 
the company completed the acquisition of american state bank corporation on december  pursuant to the merger  american state bank corporation s banking subsidiary  american state bank  merged with and into the bank 
the company completed the acquisitions of premier bancorp  inc and business holding corporation on december  pursuant to the mergers  the banking subsidiaries of these two bank holding companies  premier bank of brentwood and the business bank of baton rouge  merged with and into the bank 
noninterest expense in was also impacted by expenses related to the company s hurricane relief efforts and assistance for affected employees 
the major components of net income are discussed in more detail in the various sections that follow 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company believes that its determination of the allowance for credit losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the estimation of pension and other post retirement benefit amounts involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than the company s other significant accounting policies 
further  these estimates can be materially impacted by changes in market conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of the company s borrowers  subjecting the company to significant volatility of earnings 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established through the provision for credit losses  which is a charge against earnings 
provisions for credit losses are made to reserve for estimated probable losses on loans 
the allowance for credit losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by the company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in actual and forecasted portfolio credit quality  including delinquency  charge off and bankruptcy rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to pay 
also  at december   the impact of hurricane katrina on the company s loan customers in the hurricane affected area was a significant factor in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining an adequate allowance for credit losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates and assessments 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for credit losses 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations provisions for credit losses and allowance for credit losses included herein for more information regarding the impact of hurricane katrina on such allowances 
at december 
table of contents   the allowance for credit losses was million  representing of total loans and leases at year end 
mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others  known as mortgage servicing rights msrs 
msrs are capitalized based on the relative fair value of the servicing right and the mortgage loan on the date the mortgage loan is sold 
msrs are carried at the lower of the capitalized amount  net of accumulated amortization  or fair value 
the msrs are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
the need for and the amount of valuation allowance to reflect the carrying value of msrs at the lower of cost or fair value is a significant estimate and  if determined necessary  is reflected as a charge against mortgage lending revenue 
in determining the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights  the company utilizes the expertise of an independent third party 
utilizing assumptions about factors such as mortgage interest rates  discount rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds  market trends and industry demand  an estimate of the fair value of the company s capitalized msrs is performed by the independent third party and reviewed by management 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different fair values 
periodically  the company reviews the stratification of loans in its servicing portfolio in conjunction with its valuation 
the company does not hedge the value of capitalized msrs and  therefore  the company is susceptible to significant fluctuations in the fair value of its msrs in changing interest rate environments 
at december   the company s mortgage servicing asset was million  net of impairment of million 
pension and postretirement benefits accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit amounts is another area where the accounting guidance requires management to make various assumptions in order to appropriately value any related asset or liability 
estimates that the company makes to determine pension related assets and liabilities include actuarial assumptions  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase for participants and discount rate 
estimates that the company makes to determine asset and liability amounts for other postretirement benefits include actuarial assumptions and a discount rate 
changes in these assumptions could impact earnings 
for example  lower expected long term rates of return on plan assets could negatively impact earnings  as would lower estimated discount rates or higher rates of compensation increase 
we utilize the expertise of an independent third party to perform actuarial calculations related to the pension and other postretirement plans 
in estimating the projected benefit obligation  actuaries must make assumptions about such factors as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company calculates the expected return on plan assets each year based on the balance in the pension asset portfolio at the beginning of the year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio 
in determining the reasonableness of the expected rate of return  the company considers a variety of factors including the actual return earned on plan assets  historical rates of return on the various asset classes of which the plan portfolio is comprised and current prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts 
the company used an expected rate of return of on plan assets for  and the discount rate is the rate used to determine the present value of the company s future benefit obligations for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
it is an assumption that reflects the rates available on long term high quality fixed income debt instruments and is reset annually on the measurement date of each year 
the company lowered the discount rate used in to from in and in results of operations net interest revenue net interest revenue increased to million in from million in  which represented a decrease of from million in the increase in net interest revenue for is related to the combination of growth in loans during a rising interest rate environment and the company s continued focus on funding this growth with maturing investment securities and lower cost liabilities 
the decline in net interest revenue for primarily reflected the company s inability to reduce funding costs enough to offset falling asset yields 
net interest revenue is the difference between interest revenue earned on assets such as loans  leases and securities  and interest expense paid on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings  and continues to provide the company with its principal source of revenue 
net interest revenue is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest 
table of contents bearing liabilities 
the company s long term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest revenue  while balancing interest rate  credit  liquidity and capital risks

the relative performance of the company s lending and deposit raising functions is frequently measured by two calculations net interest margin and net interest rate spread 
net interest margin is determined by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue by average earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average fully taxable equivalent yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is generally greater than the net interest rate spread because of the additional income earned on those assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities  or free funding  such as noninterest bearing demand deposits and shareholders equity 
net interest margin for was  an increase of basis points from for  which represented a decrease of basis points from for net interest rate spread for was  an increase of basis points from for  which represented a decrease of basis points from for the increase in net interest margin and net interest rate spread in was primarily a result of the larger increase in the average rate earned on interest earning assets  from in to in  than the increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  from in to in the earning asset yield increase for was a result of the favorable economic activity throughout most of the bank s markets driving increased interest rates as well as stronger loan demand 
the company has also maintained a conservative stance in the average maturity of its investment assets mitigating the company s liability sensitivity as interest rates have increased 
the decrease in net interest margin and net interest rate spread in and was primarily because of the larger decline in the earning asset yield relative to the decline in funding cost 
in both and  the earning asset yield decrease was a result of reduced loan activity and a lower yielding investment portfolio 
while an increase in loans was noticed during the last six months of  the absence of significant loan growth during and was attributable to competitive factors and the economic environment in both the company s regional market and the national market 
with decreased demand for loans  the company invested in various securities that traditionally provide lower yields than loans  and because of the lower prevailing interest rates during the majority of and  proceeds from maturing securities were typically reinvested at lower yields than the maturing securities were earning 
the company experienced growth in average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities during the three years ended december  average interest earning assets increased during  during and during the asset growth was paced by increases in the company s securities portfolios as economic conditions and competition limited loan growth during and with the company noticing an improvement in loan growth during average interest bearing liabilities increased during  during and during because of increases in the company s deposits and short term borrowings

conversely  in the event interest rates increase after  based on this interest rate sensitivity gap  the company would likely experience decreased net interest revenue in the following one year period 
it should be noted that the balances shown in the table above are at december  and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
allocations to specific interest rate sensitivity periods are based on the earlier of maturity or repricing dates 
provisions for credit losses and allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses is the periodic cost of providing an allowance or reserve for estimated probable losses on loans and leases 
the bank employs a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses that considers both qualitative and quantitative factors and requires that management make material estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change 
some of the quantitative factors considered by the bank include loan and lease growth  changes in nonperforming and past due loans and leases  historical loan and lease loss experience  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan and lease portfolio quality  the value of collateral and concentrations of loans and leases to specific borrowers or industries 
some of the qualitative factors that the bank considers include existing general economic conditions and the inherent risks of individual loans and leases 
the allowance for credit losses is based principally upon the bank s loan and lease classification system  delinquencies and historic loss rates 
the bank has a disciplined approach for assigning credit ratings and classifications to individual credits 
each credit is assigned a grade by the appropriate loan officer  which serves as a basis for the credit analysis of the entire portfolio 
the assigned grade reflects the borrower s creditworthiness  collateral values  cash flows and other factors 
an independent loan review department of the bank is responsible for reviewing the credit rating and classification of individual credits and assessing trends in the portfolio  
table of contents adherence to internal credit policies and procedures and other factors that may affect the overall adequacy of the allowance 
the work of the loan review department is supplemented by governmental regulatory agencies in connection with their periodic examinations of the bank 
this provides an additional independent level of review 
the loss factors assigned to each classification are based upon the attributes of the loans and leases typically assigned to each grade such as loan to collateral values and borrower creditworthiness 
management periodically reviews the loss factors assigned in light of the general economic environment and overall condition of the loan and lease portfolio and modifies the loss factors assigned to each classification as it deems appropriate 
the overall allowance generally includes a component representing the results of other analyses intended to ensure that the allowance is adequate to cover other probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
this component considers analyses of changes in credit risk resulting from the differing underwriting criteria in acquired loan and lease portfolios  industry concentrations  changes in the mix of loans and leases originated  overall credit criteria and other economic indicators 
at december   special consideration was given to evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses in light of the impact of hurricane katrina on south mississippi 
by december   over of the bank s loans in the hurricane affected area had been reviewed on a loan by loan basis by the bank s local lending staff  loan administration group or internal loan review group 
the unreviewed loans were primarily small consumer loans with individual balances of  or less 
the result of this loan by loan review was a million increase in the allowance for credit losses at december  the provision for credit losses  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at december   and and net charge offs and net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases for those years are shown in the following table december dollars in thousands provision for credit losses allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding net charge offs net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases the provision for credit losses for increased from the provision for the increase in the provision for credit losses in compared to reflects the net pre tax increase in the provision of million during related to the impact of hurricane katrina on the mississippi gulf coast region

noninterest revenue the components of noninterest revenue for the years ended december   and and the percentage change from the prior year are shown in the following table 
table of contents amount change amount change amount dollars in thousands mortgage lending service charges trust income securities losses gains  net insurance commissions other total noninterest revenue the company s revenue from mortgage lending typically fluctuates as mortgage interest rates change and is primarily attributable to two activities  origination of new mortgage loans and servicing mortgage loans 
the company s normal practice is to generate mortgage loans  sell them in the secondary market and retain the msrs to the loans sold 
the mortgage origination process generates loan origination fees and net gains or losses from the sale of the mortgage loans originated  which is also referred to as secondary marketing 
these activities produced revenue of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
of the revenue from the origination process  the sale of mortgage loans resulted in a net loss of million for  a net loss of million for and a net gain of million for rising mortgage interest rates generally have resulted in a decrease in the volume of originations  while falling mortgage interest rates generally have resulted in an increased volume of originations 
the company originated mortgage loans totaling million during  million during and billion during while mortgage loan originations remained relatively static during compared to  the decrease of mortgage loans originated in reflected the historically low mortgage interest rates during that resulted in record levels of mortgage loan originations for the company in revenue from the servicing process includes fees from the actual servicing of loans and the recognition of changes in the valuation of the company s msrs 
msrs are carried as an asset at the lower of the capitalized amount  net of accumulated amortization  or fair value 
msrs are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated net servicing income 
this amortization is recognized as a reduction of servicing revenue 
msrs are also periodically evaluated for impairment based on the excess of the carrying amount of the msrs over their fair value 
if temporary impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value through a charge to servicing revenue 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to servicing revenue 
if permanent impairment exists  the msr and the valuation allowance would be reduced during the quarter in which it is identified 
during the first quarter of  an other than temporary impairment of million was identified resulting in a permanent reduction of the msr and the valuation allowance 
no other than temporary impairment to msrs was identified after the first quarter of the company does not hedge the value of its msrs and is susceptible to significant fluctuations in its value in changing interest rate environments 
when mortgage interest rates decline  refinancing of home mortgages typically accelerates and the value of the company s msrs typically declines as the expected lives of the underlying mortgages shorten 
when mortgage interest rates are rising  refinancing of home mortgages typically decline and the value of the company s msrs typically increases as the expected lives of the underlying mortgages lengthen 
the servicing process generated revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in servicing revenue was primarily a result of changes in the valuation of capitalized msrs 
for impairment testing of msrs  additional strata or risk groupings based on interest rates were added in to better reflect the then current mix of loans in the servicing portfolio 
the addition of these strata had no material impact on the impairment calculation at december  and changing mortgage interest rates in  and resulted in a temporary impairment recovery of million  million and million  respectively

the security losses in included a million other than temporary impairment charge for certain investments in fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
the security gains in were primarily a result of the sale of approximately million in intermediate term securities pursuant to the company s efforts to manage the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities 
the increase in insurance commissions in was primarily a result of the increase in policies written and the addition of experienced producers during revenue from insurance commissions increased in and as a result of the acquisition of two insurance agencies during the company plans to continue to expand the products and services offered by its insurance agencies 
because one of the company s three major insurance agencies is headquartered on the mississippi gulf coast  its commission revenue will likely be negatively impacted by the hurricane during the company has not been able to quantify the potential lost commissions resulting from hurricane katrina based on the information available 
the increase in other noninterest revenue in was primarily a result of the million gain from insurance proceeds relating to the hurricane 
this gain is primarily the result of insurance proceeds exceeding the company s write off of damage to its premises and equipment as a result of the hurricane 
other noninterest revenue in also included a  gain related to the sale of certain insurance agency accounts  a  gain on the sale of a branch bank and a million gain on the sale of the company s membership in the pulse network  an electronic banking network in which the company continues to participate and retain access

the company has not quantified the impact on non performing loans of extending loan payment dates for customers in the hurricane affected area 
the company has not  as a matter of policy  made or participated in any loans or investments relating to extraordinary corporate transactions such as leveraged buyouts or leveraged recapitalizations 
at december   and  the company did not have any concentration of loans in excess of of loans outstanding 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
however  the company does conduct business in a geographically concentrated area 
the ability of the company s borrowers to repay loans may be dependent upon the economic conditions prevailing in the company s market area

deposits deposits are the company s primary source of funds to support its earning assets 
the company has been able to effectively compete for deposits in its primary market areas  which has resulted in the increases in deposits for the years presented 
the following table presents the company s average deposit mix and percentage change for the years indicated 
table of contents average average average balance change balance change balance dollars in millions interest bearing deposits noninterest bearing deposits total average deposits liquidity and capital resources one of the company s goals is to provide adequate funds to meet increases in loan demand or any potential increase in the normal level of deposit withdrawals 
this goal is accomplished primarily by generating cash from the bank s operating activities and maintaining sufficient short term liquid assets 
these sources  coupled with a stable deposit base and a strong reputation in the capital markets  allows the company to fund earning assets and maintain the availability of funds 
management believes that the bank s traditional sources of maturing loans and investment securities  sales of loans held for sale  cash from operating activities and a strong base of core deposits are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs for normal operations over both the short term and the long term 
to provide additional liquidity  the company utilizes short term financing through the purchase of federal funds and securities lending arrangements 
further  the company maintains a borrowing relationship with the fhlb which provides liquidity to fund term loans with borrowings of matched or longer maturities 
at december   the company had long term advances from the fhlb totaling approximately million  bearing interest rates from to 
the company has pledged eligible mortgage loans to secure the fhlb borrowings and had approximately billion in additional borrowing capacity under the existing fhlb borrowing agreement at december  further  the company had informal federal funds borrowing arrangements aggregating approximately million at december  secured borrowing arrangements utilizing the company s securities portfolio also provide substantial additional liquidity to the company 
such arrangements typically provide for borrowings of to of the unencumbered fair value of the company s federal government and government agencies securities portfolio 
if these traditional sources of liquidity were constrained  the company would be forced to pursue avenues of funding not typically used and the company s net interest margin could be impacted negatively 
the company utilizes  among other tools  maturity gap tables  interest rate shock scenarios and an active asset and liability management committee to analyze  manage and plan asset growth and to assist in managing the company s net interest margin and overall level of liquidity 
the company s approach to providing adequate liquidity has been successful in the past and management does not anticipate any near or long term changes to its liquidity strategies 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various off balance sheet commitments and other arrangements to extend credit that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the company 
the business purpose of these off balance sheet commitments is the routine extension of credit 
as of december   commitments to extend credit included approximately million for letters of credit and approximately billion for interim mortgage financing  construction credit  credit card and other revolving line of credit arrangements 
while most of the commitments to extend credit are made at variable rates  included in these commitments are forward commitments to fund individual fixed rate mortgage loans of approximately million at december   with a carrying value and fair value reflecting a gain of approximately  which has been recognized in the company s results of operations 
fixed rate lending commitments expose the company to risks associated with increases in interest rates 
as a method to manage these risks  the company also enters into forward commitments to sell individual fixed rate mortgage loans 
at december   the company had million in such commitments to sell  with a carrying value and fair value reflecting a loss of approximately  the company also faces the risk of deteriorating credit quality of borrowers to whom a commitment to extend credit has been made  however  no significant credit losses are expected from these commitments and arrangements 

table of contents regulatory requirements for capital the company is required to comply with the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
these guidelines apply a variety of weighting factors which vary according to the level of risk associated with the assets 
capital is measured in two tiers tier i consists of common shareholders equity and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets  and tier ii consists of general allowance for losses on loans and leases  hybrid debt capital instruments  and all or a portion of other subordinated capital debt  depending upon remaining term to maturity 
total capital is the sum of tier i and tier ii capital 
the company s tier i capital and total capital  as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  were and  respectively  at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  both ratios exceeded the required minimum levels of and  respectively  for each period 
in addition  the company s tier i leverage capital ratio tier i capital divided by total assets  less goodwill was at december  and at december   compared to the required minimum tier i leverage capital ratio of 
the fdic s capital based supervisory system for insured financial institutions categorizes the capital position for banks into five categories  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
for a bank to classify as well capitalized  the tier i capital  total capital and leverage capital ratios must be at least  and  respectively 
the bank met the criteria for the well capitalized category as of december  as its tier i capital  total capital and leverage capital ratios were  and  respectively 
there are various legal and regulatory limits on the extent to which the bank may pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to the company 
in addition  federal and state regulatory agencies have the authority to prevent a bank or bank holding company from paying a dividend or engaging in any other activity that  in the opinion of the agency  would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
the company does not expect these limitations to have a material adverse effect on its ability to meet its cash obligations 
uses of capital the company may pursue acquisition transactions of depository institutions and businesses closely related to banking which further the company s business strategies 
the company anticipates that consideration for any such transactions would be shares of the company s common stock  cash or a combination thereof 
for example  the merger with american state bank corporation was completed on december  and the mergers with premier bancorp  inc and business holding corporation were completed on december  the consideration in each transaction was a combination of shares of the company s common stock and cash see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
on april   the company announced a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company may acquire up to million shares of its common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions during the period between may  and april  the extent and timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions and other corporate considerations 
repurchased shares will be held as authorized but unissued shares 
these authorized but unissued shares will be available for use in connection with the company s stock option plans  other compensation programs  other transactions or for other corporate purposes as determined by the company s board of directors 
at december    shares had been repurchased under this program 
the company will continue to evaluate additional share repurchases under this repurchase program and will evaluate whether to adopt a new stock repurchase program before the current program expires 
the company conducts its stock repurchase program by using funds received in the ordinary course of business 
the company has not experienced  and does not expect to experience  a material adverse effect on its capital resources or liquidity in connection with its stock repurchase program during the terms of the program 
from january  through december   the company had repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock under various approved repurchase programs 
in  the company issued  in junior subordinated debt securities to bancorpsouth capital trust i the trust  a business trust 
the trust used the proceeds from the issuance of million shares of trust preferred securities  face value per share  to acquire the junior subordinated debt securities 
both the junior subordinated debt securities and the trust preferred securities mature on january   and are callable at the option of the company after january  the million in trust preferred securities issued by the trust qualifies as tier i capital under federal reserve guidelines 

table of contents the company may prepay the junior subordinated debt securities  and in turn the trust preferred securities  at a prepayment price of of the principal amount of these securities within days of a determination by the federal reserve that trust preferred securities will no longer qualify as tier i capital 
the company assumed million in junior subordinated debt securities and the related million in trust preferred securities pursuant to the mergers on december  with premier bancorp  inc and business holding corporation and assumed million in junior subordinated debt securities and the related million in trust preferred securities pursuant to the merger on december  with american state bank corporation see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate million in trust preferred securities qualifies as tier i capital under federal reserve guidelines 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements 
see notes   and to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further disclosures regarding contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands contractual obligations deposit maturities junior subordinated debt long term debt other borrowings operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the company s operating lease obligations represent short and long term operating lease and rental payments for facilities  certain software and data processing and other equipment 
purchase obligations represent obligations to purchase goods and services that are legally binding and enforceable on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts presented above primarily relate to certain contractual payments for services provided related to information technology 
certain litigation contingencies the company and its subsidiaries are engaged in lines of business that are heavily regulated and involve a large volume of financial transactions with numerous customers through offices in six states 
although the company and its subsidiaries have developed policies and procedures to minimize the impact of legal noncompliance and other disputes  litigation presents an ongoing risk 
additionally  the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business  including claims against entities to which the company is a successor as a result of business combinations 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolutions of this category of claims should not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
litigation is  however  inherently uncertain  and the company cannot make assurances that it will prevail in any of these actions  nor can it estimate with reasonable certainty the amount of damages that it might incur 
income tax contingencies the state tax commission of the state of mississippi completed its audit of the bank s state income tax return for the tax years through in the second quarter of as a result of this audit  the state tax commission assessed the bank additional taxes of approximately million along with interest and penalties totaling approximately million 
based on the advice of legal counsel  management believes that there is no substantial basis for the position taken by the mississippi state tax commission and that the company has 
table of contents meritorious defenses to dispute this assessment of additional taxes 
the company is in the midst of the administrative appeals process and a final decision has not been rendered by the state tax commission 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in having the assessment reduced on appeal 
the company s potential exposure with regard to this assessment will be the additional tax  interest and penalties assessed in may plus interest that will continue to accrue from may through the appeals process and legal costs associated with the appeal 
management does not believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  although any significant additional assessment could materially adversely affect earnings in the period in which it is recorded 
item a 
quanitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from changes in interest rates and market prices 
this risk of loss can be reflected in either reduced potential net interest revenue in future periods or diminished market values of financial assets 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk that is inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid 
the rates of interest the company earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities are established contractually for a period of time 
because market interest rates change over time  the company is exposed to lower profit margins or losses if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
several techniques might be used by a financial institution to minimize interest rate risk 
one approach used by the company is to periodically analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investing decisions based on payment streams  interest rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities and estimated sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
such activities fall under the broad definition of asset liability management 
the company s primary asset liability management technique is the measurement of its asset liability gap  that is  the difference between the amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced repriced during a given period 
if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount for a certain day  month  year or longer period  the company is in an asset sensitive gap position 
in this situation  net interest revenue would increase if market interest rates rose or decrease if market interest rates fell 
if  alternatively  more liabilities than assets will reprice  the company is in a liability sensitive position 
accordingly  net interest revenue would decline when rates rose and increase when rates fell 
these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude  whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities 
management seeks to manage interest rate risk through the utilization of various tools that include matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities and managing the composition and size of the investment portfolio so as to reduce the risk in the deposit and loan portfolios  while at the same time maximizing the yield generated from the portfolio 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the expected maturity categories take into account repricing opportunities as well as contractual maturities 
for core deposits without contractual maturities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents cash flows based on management s judgement concerning their most likely runoff or repricing behaviors 
the fair value of loans  deposits and other borrowings are based on the discounted value of expected cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the maturity 
the fair value of securities is based on market prices or dealer quotes
