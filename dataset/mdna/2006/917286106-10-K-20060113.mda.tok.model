executive summary the company  a reit  is a fully integrated  self administered real estate company engaged in the acquisition  ownership and management of commercial real estate  primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the united states 
other real estate assets include office and retail buildings and industrial properties 
the company s major tenants include supermarket chains and other retailers who sell basic necessities 
at october   the company owned or had controlling interests in properties containing a total of million square feet of gla of which approximately was leased 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long term leases and focuses ints investment activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers  anchored principally by regional supermarket chains 
the company believes  because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at supermarket anchored shopping centers  that the nature of its investments provide for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times 
the company focuses on increasing cash flow  and consequently the value of its properties and seeks continued growth through strategic re leasing  renovations and expansion of its existing properties and selective acquisition of income producing properties  primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the united states 
key elements of the company s growth strategies and operating policies are to x acquire neighborhood and community shopping centers in the northeastern part of the united states with a concentration in fairfield county  connecticut  and westchester and putnam counties  new york x hold core properties for long term investment and enhance their value through regular maintenance  periodic renovation and capital improvement x selectively dispose of non core assets and re deploy the proceeds into properties located in the company s preferred region x increase property values by aggressively marketing available gla and renewing existing leases x renovate  reconfigure or expand existing properties to meet the needs of existing or new tenants x negotiate and sign leases which provide for regular or fixed contractual increases to minimum rents x control property operating and administrative costs critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company records base rents on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant receivables on the accompanying balance sheets 
most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses 
adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables  the payment history of the tenants or other debtors  the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management s assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  among other things 
management s estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants  particularly those at retail centers 
estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate tax and insurance costs 
the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes  common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write offs 
based on its analysis  the company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items 
it is also the company s policy to maintain an allowance of approximately of the deferred straight line rents receivable balance for future tenant credit losses 
real estate land  buildings  property improvements  furniture fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of an acquisition and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the company allocates the cost of an acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its acquisitions 
the valuation of the fair value of intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions  probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in place leases 
this market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant s industry  location within the property and competition in the specific region in which the property operates 
differences in the amount attributed to the intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years property improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements shorter of lease term or their useful life asset impairment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties and mortgage notes receivable may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired when management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the net carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the company s plans or market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses which could be substantial 
management does not believe that the value of any of its rental properties or mortgage notes receivable is impaired at october  liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million in the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources include its cash and cash equivalents  proceeds from bank borrowings and long term mortgage debt  capital financings and sales of real estate investments 
payments of expenses related to real estate operations  debt service  management and professional fees  and dividend requirements place demands on the company s short term liquidity 
cash flows the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements primarily by generating net cash from the operations of its properties 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity requirements for fiscal and to meet its dividend requirements necessary to maintain its reit status 
in fiscal  and  net cash flow provided by operations amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
cash dividends paid on common and preferred shares increased to million in compared to million in and million in the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders 
these dividends will be paid from operating cash flows which are expected to increase due to property acquisitions and growth in operating income in the existing portfolio and from other sources 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from tenants under existing leases at its properties 
the company s operating cash flow therefore depends on the rents that it is able to charge to its tenants  and the ability of its tenants to make rental payments 
the company believes that the nature of the properties in which it typically invests primarily grocery anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that consumers still need to purchase basic staples and convenience items 
however  even in the geographic areas in which the company owns properties  general economic downturns may adversely impact the ability of the company s tenants to make lease payments and the company s ability to re lease space as leases expire 
in either of these cases  the company s cash flow could be adversely affected 
net cash flow from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in the changes in operating cash flows were primarily due to increases in the net operating results generated from the company s core properties and operating cash flows from new properties acquired during those periods 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million in  million in and million in the net cash flows in each of these years were principally due to the acquisition of properties consistent with the company s strategic plan to acquire properties in the northeast 
the company acquired two shopping centers in  and four retail properties in both and in  the company sold two properties 
sale proceeds were used to purchase properties in the northeast 
in  the company sold investments in marketable securities to purchse real estate properties 
financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to million in and million in net cash flows used in financing activities in were million 
the company received net proceeds of million in and million in from sales of preferred stock 
in fiscal  the company borrowed million under its bank lines of credit  which amounts were fully repaid during the year 
the company makes quarterly distributions to its shareholders which totaled million in  million in and million in capital resources the company expects to fund its long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures through other long term indebtedness including indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  proceeds from sales of properties and or the issuance of equity securities 
the company believes that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future to fund its long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on its access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of its unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by existing lenders 
the company s ability to raise funds through sales of equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and its stock price in the market 
the company s ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will be dependent upon market conditions at the time of sale 
financings and debt on october  the company publicly announced that its board of directors approved a share repurchase program of up to  shares  in the aggregate  of the company s common and class a common stock 
the program does not have a specific expiration date and may be discontinued at any time 
there is no assurance that the company will repurchase the full amount of shares authorized 
in april  the company sold  shares of series d senior cumulative preferred stock series d preferred stock in a public offering for net proceeds of approximately million 
in may  the company sold an additional  shares of series d preferred stock in a public offering for net proceeds of million and in june  the company sold an additional  shares of series d preferred stock in a public offering for net proceeds of million 
the series d preferred stock has no stated maturity and is not convertible into other securities of the company 
on or after april   the series d preferred stock may be redeemed by the company  at its option  at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the company utilized a portion of the net proceeds from the preferred stock sales to repay all of its then outstanding secured and unsecured revolving credit line indebtedness of million 
the company also used approximately million of the net proceeds to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of staples plaza acquired in june the balance of the net proceeds is expected to be used to acquire other income producing properties and to fund renovations on  or capital improvements to  existing properties  including tenant improvements and for working capital 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at october   the company did not have any variable rate debt outstanding 
mortgage notes payable of million consist of fixed rate mortgage loan indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of at october  the mortgage loans are secured by seventeen properties with a net book value of million and have fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
in june  the company fully repaid a mortgage note in the principal amount of million 
in connection with the acquisition of staples plaza  the company assumed an existing first mortgage loan on the property 
the company recorded the mortgage loan at its estimated fair value which approximated million 
the mortgage loan matures in and has an effective interest rate of 
the company expects to refinance most of its mortgage loans  at or prior to scheduled maturity  through replacement mortgage loans 
the ability to do so  however  is dependent upon various factors  including the income level of the properties  interest rates and credit conditions within the commercial real estate market 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such refinancings can be achieved 
in april  the company entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a commercial bank which provides for borrowings of up to million for a three year period 
the secured revolving credit facility is collateralized by two properties having a net book value of million at october  this credit line replaced a secured revolving credit line of million that was scheduled to expire in october during fiscal  the company borrowed million under the credit line to complete the acquisition of the dock 
the borrowings were fully repaid from proceeds of the company s new issue of series d preferred stock 
there were no borrowings outstanding on the secured revolving credit facility at october  the company also has an unsecured revolving line of credit with the same bank which was increased from million to million in june the unsecured credit line expires in january the company is in the process of extending the unsecured credit line for an additional one year period 
during fiscal  the company borrowed million under this line of credit 
the funds were used for working capital purposes and fully repaid during the year 
at october   there were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit 
extensions of credit under the unsecured credit line are at the bank s discretion and subject to the bank s satisfaction of certain conditions which must be met by the company 
both credit lines are available to finance the acquisition  management and or development of commercial real estate  refinance indebtedness and for working capital purposes 
contractual obligations the company s contractual payment obligations as of october   were as follows amounts in thousands payments due by period total thereafter mortgage notes payable        tenant obligations total contractual obligations        committed tenant related obligations based on executed leases as of october  the company has various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to its property management 
in addition  the company also has certain other utility contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business which may extend beyond one year  which vary based on usage 
these contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties 
contract terms are generally one year or less 
off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended october  and  the company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
capital expenditures the company invests in its existing properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties 
the company believes that such expenditures enhance the competitiveness of its properties 
in the year ended october   the company incurred approximately million for capital expenditures for property improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
the company expects to incur approximately million for anticipated capital improvements and leasing costs in fiscal these expenditures are expected to be funded from operating cash flows or borrowings 
acquisitions the company seeks to acquire properties which are primarily shopping centers located in the northeastern part of the united states with a concentration in fairfield county  connecticut and westchester and putnam counties  new york 
the company was the sole general partner in a limited partnership that owned the arcadian shopping center in briarcliff manor  new york 
in july  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company acquired the remaining limited partner interests in the partnership for a purchase price of million 
the company now controls of the property 
in june  the company purchased a  square foot shopping center in yorktown  new york 
the purchase price was million  including the assumption of a first mortgage loan and closing costs of approximately  the cash portion of the purchase price was funded from a portion of the proceeds from the company s sales of the series d preferred stock 
in january  the company acquired the dock  a  square foot shopping center located in stratford  connecticut for million  including closing costs of approximately  the acquisition was funded with cash of approximately million  net proceeds of million from the sale of property see discussion below and borrowings of million under the company s secured line of credit 
the borrowings were repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the series d preferred stock in may during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company terminated a contract for the purchase of a retail property for a purchase price of million in fiscal  the company acquired four retail properties totaling  square feet of leasable space  for a total purchase price of million 
in connection with the acquisition of three of the properties  the company assumed mortgage loans totaling million 
sales in november  the company sold its farmingdale  new york property for a sale price of million 
the proceeds were used to complete the acquisition of the dock in january the company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately million in fiscal the property was classified as held for sale at october  in june  the company sold an office building in southfield  michigan for a sale price of million 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of million in fiscal non core assets in a prior year  the company s board of directors expanded and refined the strategic objectives of the company to refocus its real estate portfolio into one of self managed retail properties located in the northeast and authorized the sale of the company s non core properties in the normal course of business over a period of several years 
the non core properties consist of two distribution service facilities and one retail property all of which are located outside of the northeast region of the united states 
the company intends to sell its non core properties as opportunities become available 
the company s ability to generate cash from asset sales is dependent upon market conditions and will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
during fiscal  the company sold a non core office property located in southfield  michigan for a sales price of million and realized a gain on sale of the property of million 
at october   the three remaining non core properties have a net book value of approximately million 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be an additional measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
the company reports ffo in addition to its net income applicable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities 
management has adopted the definition suggested by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
management considers ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of its real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
it is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the company s operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of property and deprecation and amortization 
however  ffo x does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income  and x should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance 
ffo  as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other real estate investment trusts due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
the table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders in accordance with gaap to ffo for each of the three years in the period ended october  amounts in thousands 
year ended october  net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders    plus real property depreciation    amortization of tenant improvements and allowances    amortization of deferred leasing costs depreciation and amortization on discontinued operations less gains on sales of properties  funds from operations applicable to common and class a common stockholders    net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    ffo amounted to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in ffo is attributable to a an increase in property operating income and recent property acquisitions which increased operating rents and net operating income  b higher general and administrative expenses and c the effect of lower yielding returns on the temporary investment of the proceeds remaining from the sales of the company s new issue of series d preferred stock in fiscal see discussion which follows 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues rental revenues from base rents increased to million in the year ended october   as compared to million in fiscal the net change in rentals resulted primary from i the additional base rents from properties acquired during and which increased base rents incrementally by million in fiscal and ii an increase of  principally from new leasing and renewals of expiring leases at the company s core properties and generally at higher base rental rates compared to the expiring rental rates 
during fiscal  the company leased or renewed  square feet of gross leasable area gla at its core properties compared to  square feet in fiscal the company also extended a triple net lease on its  square foot industrial property in dallas texas for an additional five year term at approximately the same effective rent as the existing lease on the property

the company s single largest real estate investment is the ridgeway shopping center located in stamford  connecticut which is owned by a consolidated joint venture in which the company has a controlling interest

this component of income also includes gains on sales of securities which totaled  in fiscal expenses property operating expenses increased to million in the year ended october  compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses in fiscal reflects the incremental expense from recent property acquisitions which added additional operating expenses of million in fiscal operating expenses for properties owned in both periods increased by  principally due to higher snow removal and repairs and maintenance costs in fiscal property taxes increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal property taxes from recently acquired properties increased this component of expenses by  in fiscal year property taxes for properties owned in both fiscal and increased by  from higher real estate tax assessment rates at several of the company s properties during fiscal the company anticipates that property tax assessments will continue to increase in the near term 
however  the company will continue to challenge these higher assessments when warranted 
interest expense increased  in fiscal principally from the addition of an million mortgage note assumed in connection with the acquisition of staples plaza in fiscal and mortgages totaling million assumed in the rye properties acquisitions in fiscal interest expense also increased this year from short term borrowings of million on the company s secured and unsecured revolving credit lines 
borrowings of million were used to complete the acquisition of a property earlier in the year 
the borrowings were fully repaid during the second quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal the increase is principally from property acquisitions in fiscal which increased this component of expense by million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal from higher compensation costs from an increase in the number of employees of the company and higher stock compensation charges  which increased compensation by approximately  in fiscal the company also recorded a charge of approximately  to reflect a deferred compensation arrangement at fair value during the year

fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues base rents increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in base rents reflected the additional base rents from four properties acquired in the acquisitions of these properties increased base rents incrementally by million in fiscal in addition  base rents increased by  in fiscal from the effect of new leasing and renewals of expiring leases at generally higher base rental rates 
recoveries from tenants which represent reimbursements from tenants for property operating expenses and property taxes increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in recoveries from tenants included amounts applicable to properties acquired in fiscal which increased this component of revenues by  in fiscal recoveries from tenants for properties owned in both and increased by  due to higher tenant recovery rates and property tax recoveries 
in fiscal  the company leased or renewed approximately  square feet of space or of total core property gla 
at october   the company s core properties were leased  an increase of approximately from the beginning of the year 
the company s non core office building property in southfield  michigan was approximately vacant at october  the office leasing market in this region of the country continued to be weak and the company aggressively marketed vacancies at the property 
a tenant who leased  square feet of space in the building did not renew its lease upon expiration in december the office building was subsequently sold in fiscal lease termination income of  in fiscal consisted of a lease cancellation payment of  from a tenant who terminated during the year and a payment of  received in settlement of a bankruptcy action of a former tenant 
interest income decreased from the prior year from the utilization of cash to purchase properties in both fiscal and and the repayment of a million note receivable in fiscal expenses property operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in property expenses of acquired properties increased operating expenses by  in fiscal operating expenses for properties owned in both and decreased by  from lower snow removal costs and repairs and maintenance expenses 
property taxes increased to million or in fiscal compared to million in fiscal new properties increased property taxes by  in that year 
property taxes for properties owned in both years increased by  from higher real estate tax assessment rates at several of the company s properties 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  in fiscal  from additional depreciation on recent property acquisitions 
general and administrative expense increased by  in fiscal  due primarily to higher compensation expense 
inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive a scheduled base rent increases and b percentage rents based upon tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise 
in addition  many of the company s non anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
environmental matters based upon management s ongoing review of its properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the company s properties that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that a the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  b changes in law  c the conduct of tenants or d activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the company s properties  will not expose the company to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the company s tenants  which would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
the following table sets forth the company s long term debt obligations by principal cash payments and maturity dates  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value at october  amounts in thousands  except weighted average interest rate for the years ended october  estimated thereafter total fair value mortgage notes payable         weighted average interest rate for debt maturing as of october   the company had no outstanding variable rate debt 
during the year ended october   the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate debt during the period was approximately 
a hypothetical increase of in interest rates would have had an immaterial effect on the company s interest expense 
there were no variable rate borrowings in fiscal the company believes that its weighted average interest rate of on its fixed rate debt is not materially different from current market interest rates for debt instruments with similar risks and maturities 
the company has not planned  and does not plan  to enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
