item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ensco international incorporated and subsidiaries ensco or the company is an international offshore contract drilling company with a current operating fleet of drilling rigs  including jackup rigs  one ultra deepwater semisubmersible rig  one platform rig and one barge rig 
additionally  the company has two ultra deepwater semisubmersible rigs and one ultra high specification jackup rig under construction 
the company s offshore contract drilling operations are integral to the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas and the company is one of the leading providers of offshore drilling services to the international oil and gas industry 
the company drills and completes oil and gas wells under contracts with major international  government owned and independent oil and gas companies 
the drilling services provided by the company are conducted on a day rate contract basis  under which the company provides its drilling rigs and rig crews and receives a fixed amount per day for drilling wells 
the customer bears substantially all of the ancillary costs of constructing the wells and supporting drilling operations  as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the wells 
financial operating results in the offshore contract drilling industry have historically been very cyclical and are primarily related to the demand for drilling rigs and the available supply of rigs 
demand for rigs is directly related to the regional and worldwide levels of offshore exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  which is beyond the control of the company 
offshore exploration and development spending may fluctuate substantially from year to year and from region to region 
such spending fluctuations result from many factors  including demand for oil and gas  regional and global economic conditions and expected changes therein  political  social and legislative environments in the us and other major oil producing countries  production levels and related activities of opec and other oil and gas producers  technological advancements that impact the methods or cost of oil and gas exploration and development  and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
the supply of drilling rigs is limited and new rigs require a substantial capital investment and a long period of time to construct 
in addition  it is time consuming and costly to move rigs between markets 
accordingly  as demand changes in a particular market  the supply of rigs may not adjust quickly  and therefore the utilization and day rates of rigs could fluctuate significantly 
certain events  such as hurricanes  may impact the supply of rigs in a particular market and cause rapid fluctuations in rig demand  utilization and day rates 
since factors that affect offshore exploration and development spending are beyond the control of the company and rig demand can change quickly  it is difficult for the company to predict industry conditions or trends in operating results 
periods of low demand result in excess rig supply  which generally reduces rig utilization levels and day rates  periods of high demand tighten rig supply  generally resulting in increased rig utilization levels and day rates 

table of contents the company s drilling rigs are deployed throughout the world  with drilling operations concentrated in the major geographic regions of north america  europe africa  asia pacific which includes asia  the middle east  australia and new zealand and south america caribbean 
the company competes with other offshore drilling contractors on the basis of price  quality of service  operational and safety performance  equipment suitability and availability  reputation and technical expertise 
competition is usually on a regional basis  but offshore drilling rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from one region to another in response to demand 
business environment the company s north america offshore drilling operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
the us natural gas market and trends in oil and gas company spending largely determine offshore drilling industry conditions in this region 
during the first half of  the supply of jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico was in excess of a declining demand as oil and gas companies focused more of their spending on international projects 
this imbalance led to a further reduction of day rates from already reduced historical levels 
during the second half of  day rates for gulf of mexico jackup rigs began to improve as the supply of jackup rigs declined after some of the company s competitors mobilized rigs to international markets in response to contract opportunities 
in  the supply of jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico declined further as the company and some of its competitors mobilized additional rigs to international markets 
additionally  demand improved significantly during the second half of due to increased spending by oil and gas companies 
even though day rate trends were mixed during the first six months of  with day rates for the larger premium jackup rigs decreasing slightly from year end levels due to a modest oversupply of larger rigs  average day rates for jackup rigs in the gulf of mexico improved significantly during the second half of  due to both the reduced supply of rigs and increased spending by oil and gas companies 
during  day rates of gulf of mexico jackup rigs continued to increase as a result of a further reduction in the supply of available rigs in the region and increased demand 
the supply of jackup rigs began to tighten in mid as several of the company s competitors announced the planned departure of rigs contracted outside the region 
these rigs became unavailable during the latter half of to prepare for mobilization outside the region 
additionally  hurricane katrina and hurricane rita disrupted drilling operations and severely damaged or destroyed several rigs operating in the region thereby reducing the number of available rigs even further 
the demand for gulf of mexico jackup rigs continued to strengthen during as oil and gas companies increased spending due to an increasing global demand for oil coupled with record level oil and natural gas prices 

table of contents the company s europe africa offshore drilling operations are mainly conducted in northern europe where jackup rig demand and day rates remained fairly stable over the first half of  as the impact of reduced spending by oil and gas companies was offset by a reduction in the supply of rigs after some of the company s competitors mobilized rigs to stronger markets 
during the second half of  reduced oil and gas company spending resulted in limited term work opportunities and jackup day rates in europe declined 
during  demand and day rates for jackup rigs in this region generally remained at reduced levels until the fourth quarter when demand and day rates began to improve 
during  day rates continued to improve as high oil and natural gas prices as well as an increasing global demand for oil have resulted in increased spending by oil and gas companies 
demand for jackup rigs in most asia pacific region markets was strong during and  as many of the major international and government owned oil companies increased spending in those markets 
however  asia pacific region day rates remained relatively stable during this period as the company and some of its competitors mobilized additional rigs to the region in response to the increased demand 
demand continued to strengthen during and increased activity levels absorbed the additional rigs mobilized to the region and improved day rates 
results of operations in recent years  the company has disposed of several assets  including the sale of its vessel marine transportations fleet in  the exchange of three rigs in connection with a construction agreement in  the sale of six barge rigs and a platform rig in  and the loss of two rigs as a result of damage caused by hurricanes  one in and the other in the operating results of these assets have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for each of the years in the three year period ended december  see discontinued operations below for further information regarding the operating results and disposal of these assets

liquidity the company s liquidity position at december   and is summarized in the table below in millions  except ratios cash and short term investments working capital current ratio 
table of contents management expects to fund the company s short term liquidity needs  including an aggregate million of contractual obligations and anticipated capital expenditures during  as well as any working capital requirements  from its cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow 
management expects to fund the company s long term liquidity needs  including contractual obligations and anticipated capital expenditures  from its cash and cash equivalents  investments  operating cash flow and  if necessary  funds drawn under the credit facility or other future financing arrangements 
the company has historically funded the majority of its liquidity from operating cash flow 
the company anticipates a substantial amount of its cash flow in the near to intermediate term will continue to be invested in the expansion and enhancement of its fleet of drilling rigs 
as a substantial amount of such expenditures are elective  the company expects to be able to maintain adequate liquidity throughout future business cycles through the deferral or acceleration of its future capital investments  as necessary 
accordingly  while future operating cash flow cannot be accurately predicted  management believes its long term liquidity will continue to be funded primarily by operating cash flow 
market risk the company has net assets and liabilities denominated in numerous foreign currencies and uses various methods to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company predominantly structures its drilling contracts in us dollars  which significantly reduces the portion of the company s cash flows and assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also employs various strategies  including the use of derivative instruments  to match foreign currency denominated assets with equal or near equal amounts of foreign currency denominated liabilities  thereby minimizing exposure to earnings fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december   the company had contracts outstanding to exchange an aggregate million us dollars for various foreign currencies  all of which mature during the next twelve months 
based on a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the net unrealized loss associated with the company s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and related foreign currency exchange contracts as of december  would approximate million 

table of contents the company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the company occasionally uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the variable interest rate on debt to a fixed rate or the fixed rate on debt to a variable rate  and interest rate lock agreements to hedge against increases in interest rates on pending financing

table of contents outlook changes in industry conditions and the corresponding impact on the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted because of the short term nature of many of the company s contracts and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which impact expenditures for oil and gas drilling  rig utilization and day rates 
it is not determinable whether recent levels of regional and worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling and drilling activity will increase  decrease or remain unchanged 
accordingly  future rig demand and trends in average day rates and utilization levels are uncertain 
management s current plans and expectations relative to its major areas of operations and near term industry conditions are detailed below 
rig construction on january   the company accepted delivery of ensco  an ultra high specification jackup rig that is scheduled to commence drilling operations in march in malaysia 
the company also has two ultra deepwater semisubmersible rigs and one ultra high specification jackup rig currently under construction by kfels in singapore 
ensco will be an enhanced kfels mod v b design jackup rig modified to ensco specifications and nearly identical to the recently delivered ensco ensco commenced construction in april and is expected to be delivered during the second quarter of in september  the company entered into an agreement with kfels in singapore to construct ensco  with delivery anticipated in the second quarter of the total construction cost of the rig is currently expected to be approximately million 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with kfels in singapore to construct ensco for a total construction cost of approximately million 
delivery of ensco is expected during the second quarter of the ensco series tm ultra deepwater semisubmersibles are an enhanced version of the ensco and will be capable of drilling in up to  feet of water  and can readily be upgraded to  feet water depth capability if required 
enhancements over ensco  the company s existing ultra deepwater semisubmersible rig  include a two million pound quad derrick  offline pipe handling capability  increased drilling capacity  greater variable deck load  and improved automatic station keeping ability 
with these features  the ensco series tm rigs will be especially well suited for deepwater development drilling 
the ensco and ensco are subject to long term drilling contracts of four years and three and one half years  respectively 

table of contents rig enhancements and relocations ensco entered a shipyard in november for enhancement and contract preparation work 
in march  the rig is expected to mobilize to offshore venezuela to commence a long term contract 
ensco entered a shipyard in october for enhancement procedures and is projected to return to service in the gulf of mexico during april ensco entered a shipyard in may for enhancement procedures and is expected to return to service in the gulf of mexico during march enhancement procedures were recently completed on ensco and it is currently en route to new zealand where it is expected to commence a long term contract in march ensco is scheduled to continue its commitment for work in the gulf of mexico through early when it is expected to mobilize to tunisia for an estimated two year contract  plus options 
industry conditions demand for offshore drilling rigs is strong  and utilization and day rates are generally improving  in all of the major geographical markets in which the company currently operates 
the company has substantial contract backlog and the durations of recently executed contracts are generally greater than historical average contract durations in all of the company s major geographical markets 
while it is not possible to project the period of time for which current industry conditions will be sustained or predict long term trends in industry conditions  the company does not anticipate significant changes in current industry conditions in the near term 
hurricane damage during the third quarter  ensco sustained minor damage during hurricane katrina 
the rig was repaired in early in conjunction with minor enhancement and preparatory work for its pending two year contract 
the company believes the insurance claim for the ensco hull repairs will be finalized by the end of the second quarter of with no significant gain or loss realized 
additional information regarding the resolution of insurance claims relating to hurricane damage is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
although several of the company s jackup rigs were in the paths of hurricane katrina and or huricane rita  the company has detected only minor damage to those rigs and the associated repair costs incurred  or expected to be incurred  are not significant 
in addition  none of the company s jackup rigs experienced  or is expected to experience  significant downtime in order to complete damage repairs as a result of these hurricanes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the company s management in their application  have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies are those related to property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and income taxes 
property and equipment at december   the carrying value of the company s property and equipment totaled  million  which represents of total assets 
this carrying value reflects the application of the company s property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgments by management relative to the capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of the company s rigs 

table of contents the company develops and applies property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to appropriately and consistently capitalize those costs incurred to enhance  improve and extend the useful lives of its assets and expense those costs incurred to repair or maintain the existing condition or useful lives of its assets 
the development and application of such policies requires judgment and assumptions by management relative to the nature of  and benefits from  expenditures on company assets 
the company establishes property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to depreciate or amortize its assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments used by management in determining the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of its assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives of the company s rigs  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions  and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its rigs on a periodic basis  considering operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
the company s most recent change in estimated useful lives occurred in january  when the company extended the useful lives of its drilling rigs by an average of five to six years 
under the company s depreciation policy  the fleet of jackup rigs as of december   which comprise in excess of of both the gross cost and net carrying amount of the company s property and equipment at december   is depreciated over useful lives ranging from to years 
the company s ultra deepwater semisubmersible rig is depreciated over a year useful life 
the following table provides an analysis of estimated increases and decreases in depreciation expense that would have been recognized for the year ended december  for various assumed changes in the useful lives of the company s drilling rigs effective january  increase decrease in useful lives of the company s drilling rigs estimated increase decrease in depreciation expense that would have been recognized in millions 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment  primarily its drilling rigs  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable 
generally  extended periods of idle time and or inability to contract rigs at economical rates are an indication that a rig may be impaired 
however  the offshore drilling industry is highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change 
likewise  during periods of supply and demand imbalance  rigs are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods of time until demand comes back into balance with supply 
impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs  groups of rigs  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or rigs in a certain geographic location 
the company s rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from markets with excess supply  if economically feasible 
the company s jackup rigs and ultra deepwater semisubmersible rig are suited for  and accessible to  broad and numerous markets throughout the world 
however  there are fewer economically feasible markets available to the company s barge rig and platform rig 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify reporting units and estimate the fair value of those units as of the testing date 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  its goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the company estimates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess 
in the event the company disposes drilling rig operations that constitute a business  goodwill would be allocated in the determination of gain or loss on sale 
based on the company s goodwill impairment analysis performed as of december   there was no impairment of goodwill 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
in most instances they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by the company s drilling rigs  and are based on management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and operations  as well as management s estimates of future expected utilization  contract rates  expense levels and capital requirements of the company s drilling rigs 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments used by management in the application of the company s asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational  industry  economic and political environments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  judgments and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes the company conducts operations and earns income in numerous foreign countries and is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries  as well as us federal and state tax laws 
at december   the company has a million net deferred income tax liability and million of accrued liabilities for income taxes currently payable 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of the company s income tax accounting policies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgments regarding the interpretation of the provisions of sfas carryforwards and tax credits are assessed for realization as a reduction of future taxable income by using a more likely than not determination 
a us deferred tax liability has not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is not practicable to estimate 
should the company elect to make a distribution of foreign earnings  or be deemed to have made a distribution of foreign earnings through application of various provisions of the internal revenue code  it may be subject to additional us income taxes 
the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretation of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes  especially those involving the deployment of tax planning strategies  may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations 

table of contents the company operates in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to the offshore drilling industry are not well developed 
in jurisdictions where available statutory law and regulations are incomplete or underdeveloped  the company obtains professional guidance and considers existing industry practices before deploying tax planning strategies and meeting its tax obligations 
tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through a negotiation process 
while the company has historically not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns  there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise in the future 
in addition  there are several factors that could cause the future level of uncertainty relating to the company s tax liabilities to increase  including the following during recent years the portion of the company s overall operations conducted in foreign tax jurisdictions has been increasing and the company currently anticipates this trend will continue 
in order to deploy tax planning strategies and conduct foreign operations efficiently  the company s subsidiaries frequently enter into transactions with affiliates  which are generally subject to complex tax regulations and frequently are reviewed by tax authorities 
the company may conduct future operations in certain tax jurisdictions where tax laws are not well developed and it may be difficult to secure adequate professional guidance 
tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties change frequently  requiring the company to modify existing tax strategies to conform to such changes
