the outstanding shares of the merging corporations were cancelled and no shares of ablest inc were issued in exchange 
the outstanding shares of ablest inc remain outstanding and were not affected by the merger 
for financial reporting purposes  the company s former industrial maintenance business is reported as a discontinued operation 
the following discussions and analysis of operations and financial condition pertain to the company s staffing services business  which constitutes the continuing operations 
a separate section labeled discontinued operations is included at the end of this discussion and pertains to the disposal of the industrial maintenance business 
overview we derive our revenues from providing clerical  industrial  technical  and finance and accounting staffing services in the united states 
we currently provide our staffing services principally through company owned service locations in the eastern united states and selected southwestern markets 
we fill positions in data entry  office administration  telemarketing  light industrial assembly  order picking and shipping  network administration  database administration  program analyst both mainframe and client server  web development  project management  technical writing  accounting  financial analysis  and internal auditing  among others 
we do not service any specific industry or field  instead  our services are provided to a broad based customer list 
during the twelve fiscal months ended december   the company placed approximately  workers and provided approximately million hours of staffing services to approximately clients 
substantially all of our revenues are driven by hours billed and billing rates 
our billing rates are generally negotiated and invoiced on a per hour basis 
accordingly  as we place temporary employees  we record revenue 
table of contents based on their hours worked 
our gross margins are determined by deducting temporary employee pay  related taxes  benefits and other direct placement costs such as drug screens  background and reference checks 
piecework contracts are billed to the customer on a cost per unit basis versus an hourly basis 
revenue from piecework contracts is recognized at the time service is performed 
permanent placement services are fee based services to recruit and fill regular staff positions for customers 
revenue from permanent placement services is recognized when a candidate begins full time employment 
customer demand for our employment services depends significantly on the overall strength of the labor market 
improving economic growth typically results in increased demand for labor  resulting in greater demand for our services 
correspondingly  during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction  the demand for our services typically declines 
due to the dependence of the staffing industry growth on economic factors  the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short term nature of staffing assignments  it is difficult to forecast future demand for our services with any certainty 
as a result  we monitor a number of economic indicators  as well as recent business trends  in an effort to predict demand for temporary staffing services 
based upon these anticipated trends  we determine whether changes in personnel or other adjustments to our business are appropriate 
historically  our business has expanded through both internal growth of existing branch offices and opening new branch offices 
during and  we opened new branch office locations and focused on increasing revenues of existing branch offices 
during  we intend to open strategically located branches that we believe will enhance our current customer relationships as well as facilitate establishing new ones 
we believe that the amount of capital required to open new branches is less than the amount of capital required to consummate acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully open new branches or that  if opened  such branches will result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
we continue to try to improve our gross margins by working closely with our customers to minimize costs associated with workers compensation claims 
we have implemented safety training and education programs at all branch locations and key customer locations 
we also review the risk profiles of certain clients to assess the potential workers compensation claims liabilities as compared to their potential profitability level 
in addition  we expanded our return to work program closely monitoring each employee s injury status to enable the employees to return to work as soon as medically advisable 
we attempt to manage unemployment insurance costs through aggressive claim adjudication and actively offering displaced employee s alternative job assignments 
additionally  in we implemented a new incentive compensation program for our staff associates  which we believe will result in improved pricing decisions 
the new plan compensates associates for achieving return on revenue target levels as well as higher profit levels 
we cannot assure you that our continued efforts to manage workers compensation claims and unemployment insurance costs or our new compensation plan will result in increased operating margins 
we entered into a services agreement and license support agreement with vcg  inc for the installation  maintenance and support of a new front office system  staffsuite  to be utilized in connection with our commercial and professional staffing operations 
in addition  we entered into a professional services agreement including proposal for implementation with ideal consulting  inc for the installation of great plains software for use in connection with our back office systems  including our corporate accounting  finance  human resources and customer service processes 
these two systems will replace our existing management information systems to support future growth of the company 
this implementation of a new management information system has required a significant investment in software  hardware  outside consultant assistance and internal personnel resources 
although we believe this technology initiative will increase productivity  improve operating efficiencies and lower long term operating costs  there is no assurance that such an initiative will yield its intended results 
the failure to implement new management information systems or  if implemented  delays in completing or an inability to successfully complete implementation of a new management information system could adversely affect our growth plans  operations  liquidity and financial condition 

table of contents the following table sets forth for the last five fiscal years  the number of company owned offices and its associated revenues 
average revenues per office are computed by dividing the relevant revenues by the number of offices 
our long term revenue growth depends in part upon our ability to continue to attract new clients  retain existing clients  open new company owned offices  as well as our ability to enhance the sales of existing offices beyond historical levels 
for the fiscal years ended dollars in thousands number of offices total hours billed average hours billed per office total revenue average revenue per office for the fiscal year ended december   compared to december  fiscal year was comprised of weeks  as was fiscal results of operations net service revenues totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal net service revenue increased million  or  due to the expansion of our customer base through the opening of new offices as well as the focus of the existing branches to increase account penetration and improve pricing 
the opening of new branches added million in revenues 
gross profit was million for fiscal and million for fiscal gross profit increased million  or over prior year 
gross profit for fiscal year as a percent of revenue was as compared to for fiscal year this improvement is due to increased revenue levels  management s decision to eliminate higher risk and lower margin business and the increase in direct hire and temporary to permanent business 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal these expenses were in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year as a percent of revenue 
during the fiscal year  the company and its former chief financial officer entered into a settlement agreement and complete and permanent release  dated september   pursuant to which  the company agreed to pay severance of  in addition   of this increase was attributable to our new branch openings 
the remaining variance in these expenses is due to increased compensation costs and hiring additional workforce for the higher sales volume 
the company continues to closely manage expense levels to leverage its cost structure as business volume increases 
other income expense  net  increased to  in expense for fiscal from  in income for fiscal this increase is materially due to  interest expense paid as the company had borrowings against its revolving credit facility in only the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal year included a  state incentive payment to the company 
the internal revenue service the irs has completed and closed its examinations of the company s tax returns for all years through in connection with these examinations  in january  the irs issued the company an assessment related to the previously filed tax return  which disallowed  of net operating loss nol carryfowards 
these nols represented  of the company s deferred tax 
table of contents assets  and were derived from the sale of the industrial maintenance business 
therefore  the effective tax rate for fiscal was  which resulted in tax expense of  this is compared to our fiscal tax expense of  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the company has notified the irs of their acceptance of the irs findings and we are awaiting the final irs ruling letter 
as a result of this ruling  the company has reduced the deferred tax asset to reflect this settlement and has exhausted the deferred tax asset related to the sale 
however  this adjustment did not impact revenues or operating expenses for and resulted in no cash impact for the fiscal year 
accordingly  for future periods  the company anticipates that cash outlays will occur for income tax purposes 
discontinued operations at december   there were no reserves relating to the industrial maintenance business 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii 
for the fiscal year ended december   compared to december  fiscal year was comprised of weeks  as was fiscal results of operations net service revenues totaled million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal net service revenue increased million  or  due to the addition of several large industrial customers as well as expanding services to pre existing customers 
the opening of new branches added million in revenues  with information technology related revenue increasing by  gross profit was million for fiscal and million for fiscal gross profit increased  or  despite higher state unemployment costs of  and an increase in workers compensation self insurance of  over the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for fiscal as compare to fiscal of this increase   was attributable to our new branch openings 
the company continues to closely manage expense levels and leverage its cost structure as business volume increases 
other income expense  net  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease is partly due to a  reduction in interest expense as the company had no borrowings against its revolving facility in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was  which resulted in tax expense of  this is compared to our fiscal tax benefit of million which included the reversal of a previously provided deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal without the deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal would have been

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analyses of the company s financial condition and results of operations were based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company has identified the policies below as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company s management reviews and evaluates these estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  goodwill  other long lived assets  income taxes including the deferred tax assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those most significantly affected by the judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
a allowance for doubtful accounts the company must make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
b self insurance reserves the company is self insured for the deductible amount of its general liability and workers compensation coverages 
to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability  established loss development factors are applied to current claims information 
the company maintains reserves for its workers compensation using actuarial methods to estimate the remaining undiscounted liability for the deductible portion of these claims  including those incurred but not reported 
an annual  independent actuarial study calculates an estimated ultimate liability and determines loss development factors for future periods 
the calculated ultimate liability is then reduced by cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserve 
management evaluates the accrual on a quarterly basis and adjusts as needed to reflect the required reserve calculation 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may differ from projected loss rates  which could materially affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
c goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
at december   the company did not have indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill and did not have any intangible assets with definite lives 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective december   the first day of fiscal sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase  required to be completed by june   screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary  required to be completed by december   measures the impairment 
factors included in the impairment analysis include expected revenue and ebitda growth rates  working capital needs  discount rates and earnings multiples 
these assumptions are based on management s best estimate of the current and expected economic environment 
as prescribed  the company screened for impairment of goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarters 
table of contents of and and found no instances of impairment of its recorded goodwill 
d deferred tax assets income taxes are accounted for by the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers  within each taxing jurisdiction  whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the years in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  the company has determined that the tax asset will be realizable

e revenue recognition the company generates revenue from the sale of temporary staffing and direct hire services by its operations 
temporary staffing revenues and the related labor costs and payroll taxes are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
direct hire revenues are recognized when the direct hire candidate begins full time employment 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations through existing cash balances  operating cash flows and a revolving line of credit 
the principal uses of cash are capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the nature of the staffing business requires payment of wages to temporary employees and consultants on a weekly basis  while payments from customers are generally received days after billing 
the quick ratio was to at december  and december   respectively  and the current ratio was to for the same respective periods 
the primary source of funding is generated from results of operations 
net working capital increased by million during fiscal as a result of operations 
contributing to this was an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the higher level of revenue being generated during this period and an increase in cash of  this was offset by an increase in accrued expenses of  cash flows as of december   the company had total cash resources available of million all held in the united states 
on august   the company entered into a modification agreement with manufacturers and traders trust company m t that extends for three years the  committed revolving credit facility facility originally signed on august  the company elects the interest rate on borrowings under the facility at the time of borrowing at either the bank s prime rate or the thirty  sixty or ninety day libor as defined in the agreement plus basis points  a reduction of basis points from the expiring agreement 
the facility expires on august  and is renewable with the consent of both parties 
the facility requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants including a tangible net worth ratio among other restrictions 
the most restrictive covenant is the limitation of total indebtedness which caps total funded indebtedness to times the four most recent quarter s ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  the company had  in borrowings against the facility and subsequently paid all of the borrowings back 
table of contents within this same quarter 
during this time and throughout  the company was in compliance with all covenants 
it is anticipated that existing funds  cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to cover working capital requirements  organic growth and capital expenditure requirements 
operating cash flows operating cash flows for of million are primarily comprised of earnings   of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  stock compensation of  and a non cash deferred income tax benefit of million offset by working capital usage of million 
days sales outstanding dso for increased to days from days in the prior year 
each one day increase in dso approximates a source of  of working capital 
operating cash flows for of  are primarily comprised of earnings   of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  stock compensation of  and a non cash deferred income tax benefit of  offset by the working capital usage of millions 
working capital for was used primarily to fund accounts receivable as dso decreased to days from days in the prior year 
operating cash flows for of  are primarily comprised of earnings   of non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  and stock compensation of  offset by a non cash deferred income tax loss of million and by the working capital usage of millions 
working capital for was used primarily to fund accounts receivable as dso decreased to days from days in the prior year 
investing cash flows investing cash flows for of million are related to capital expenditures 
the reason for the increase is due to the company entering into a services agreement and license support agreement with vcg  inc for the installation  maintenance and support of a new front office system  staffsuite  to be utilized in connection with the company s commercial and professional staffing operations 
in addition  the company entered into a professional services agreement including proposal for implementation with ideal consulting  inc for the installation of great plains software for use in connection with the company s back office systems  including its corporate accounting  finance  human resources and customer service processes 
these two systems will replace its existing management information systems to support future growth of the company 
this implementation of a new management information system has required a significant investment in software  hardware  outside consultant assistance and internal personnel resources 
investing cash flows for of  are related to capital expenditures 
investing cash flows for of  are related to capital expenditures 
the company expects the total capital expenditures to be between million and million and to be funded through operating cash flow or through borrowings under the existing revolving line of credit 
a significant portion of the expenditures will be related to the continuation of the implementation of the systems previously mentioned as well as affiliated with the move of the corporate headquarters office and its build out in late march financing cash flows the net financing cash outflows for  are zero 
the  change in net cash used by financing activities in is attributable to the company s repurchase of  outstanding common stock shares 
in and  the company borrowed against the existing line of credit and repaid the line back within the same fiscal year 
the company believes that a combination of our existing cash balances  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  
table of contents and existing revolving line of credit  taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  however  our operating cash flow could be impacted by factors outside of our control
