customers the company s current business is the outsourcing of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery 
table of contents services 
the company typically provides the gamma knife equipment  as well as planning  installation  reimbursement and marketing support services 
customers usually pay the company on a fee per use basis 
the market for these services primarily consists of major urban medical centers 
the gamma knife business is capital intensive 
the total cost of a gamma knife facility usually ranges from million to million  including equipment  site construction and installation 
the company pays for the gamma knife and the medical center generally pays for site and installation costs

table of contents the ucsf contract has been extended with a current expiration date in the company currently has no sites under development 
the company s fee per use agreement is typically for a ten year term 
the fixed fee per use reimbursement amount that the company receives from the customer is based on the company s cost to provide the service and the anticipated volume of the customer 
the contracts signed by the company typically call for a fee ranging from  to  per procedure 
there are no minimum volume guarantees required of the customer 
typically  gkf is responsible for providing the gamma knife and related ongoing gamma knife equipment expenses ie  personal property taxes  insurance  equipment maintenance and also helps fund the customer s gamma knife marketing 
the customer generally is obligated to pay site and installation costs and the costs of operating the gamma knife 
the customer can either renew the agreement or terminate the agreement at the end of the contractual term 
if the customer chooses to terminate the agreement  then gkf removes the equipment from the medical center for possible placement at another site 
the company s revenue sharing agreements retail are for a period of eight to fifteen years 
instead of receiving a fixed fee  the company receives all or a percentage of the reimbursement exclusive of physician fees received by the customer less the operating expenses of the gamma knife 
the company is at risk for any reimbursement rate changes for gamma knife services by the government or other third party payors 
the company is also at risk if it inefficiently operates the gamma knife 
there are no minimum volume guarantees required of the customer 
no individual customers accounted for more than of the company s revenue in  and marketing the company markets its services through its preferred provider status with elekta and a direct sales effort 
from april to march  the direct sales effort was executed by the company s chief executive and chief operating officers 
since march  the company has had a director of sales to lead the direct sales effort 
the major advantages to a health care provider in contracting with the company for gamma knife services include the medical center avoids the high cost of owning the equipment 
by not acquiring the gamma knife unit  the medical center is able to allocate the funds required to purchase and or finance the gamma knife to other projects 
the medical center avoids the risk of gamma knife under utilization 
the company does not have minimum volume requirements 
the medical center pays the company only for each gamma knife procedure performed on a patient 
the medical center transfers the risk of technological obsolescence to the company 
the medical center and its physicians are not under any obligation to utilize technologically obsolete equipment 

table of contents the company provides planning  installation  operating and marketing assistance and support to its gamma knife customers 
financing the company s gamma knife business is operated through gkf 
through  gkf funded its existing gamma knife units with loans from a single lender  dvi financial services inc dvi  for of the cost of each gamma knife  plus any sales tax  customs and duties 
alternative lenders were utilized for financing the company s gamma knife units that opened during and the loans are predominantly fully amortized over an month period 
the loans are collateralized by the gamma knife  customer contracts and accounts receivable  and are without recourse to the company and elekta 
dvi filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during  and all the company s loans with dvi were subsequently assumed by another lender as successor servicer 
the company continues to make payments to the successor servicer on these outstanding note balances 
management believes that the financial condition of dvi has not had a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
competition conventional neurosurgery is the primary competitor of gamma knife radiosurgery 
gamma knife surgery is gaining acceptance as an alternative and or adjunct to conventional surgery due to its more favorable morbidity outcomes for certain procedures as well as its non invasiveness 
utilization of the company s gamma knife units is contingent on the acceptance of gamma knife radiosurgery by the customer s neurosurgeons  radiation oncologists and referring physicians 
in addition  the utilization of the company s gamma knife units is impacted by the proximity of competing gamma knife centers and providers using other radiosurgery modalities 
the company s ability to secure additional customers for gamma knife services is dependent on its ability to effectively compete against i elekta  the manufacturer of the gamma knife  ii manufacturers of other radiosurgery devices primarily modified linear accelerators  and iii other companies that outsource gamma knife services 
the company does not have an exclusive relationship with elekta and has previously lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a gamma knife directly from elekta 
the company may continue to lose future sales to such customers and may also lose sales to the company s competitors 
government regulation the company s gamma knife customers receive payments for patient care from federal government and private insurer reimbursement programs 
currently in the united states  gamma knife services are performed on an in patient and on an out patient basis 
gamma knife patients with medicare as their primary insurer and treated on either an in patient or out patient basis  comprise an estimated to of the total gamma knife patients treated 

table of contents a prospective payment system pps is utilized to reimburse hospitals for care given to hospital in patients covered by federally funded reimbursement programs 
patients are classified into a diagnosis related group drg in accordance with the patient s diagnosis  necessary medical procedures and other factors 
patient reimbursement is limited to a predetermined amount for each drg 
the reimbursement payment may not necessarily cover the cost of all medical services actually provided because the payment is predetermined 
effective october   gamma knife services for medicare hospital in patients are predominantly reimbursed under either drg or drg in and again in  congress enacted legislation requiring the department of health and human services dhhs to develop proposals for a pps for medicare out patient services 
dhhs proposed a new payment system  ambulatory product classifications apc  which affects all out patient services performed in a hospital based facility 
apc implementation took place in the third quarter of the apc consists of clinically  homogenous classifications or groupings of codes that are typically used in out patient billing 
out patient services are bundled with fixed rates of payment determined according to specific regional and national factors  similar to that of the in patient pps 
the gamma knife apc rate is modified periodically but the total reimbursement amount has remained fairly constant 
however  effective january   the medicare outpatient reimbursement rate for gamma knife procedures is scheduled to increase approximately compared to the rate of reimbursement 
the company has four contracts from which its revenue is directly affected by changes in payment rates under the apc system 
some of the company s fee per use customers treat patients on an out patient basis and may also experience an increase in medicare payment in the payment of remuneration to induce the referral of health care business has been a subject of increasing governmental and regulatory focus in recent years 
section b b of the social security act sometimes referred to as the federal anti kickback statute provides criminal penalties for individuals or entities that knowingly and willfully offer  pay  solicit or receive remuneration in order to induce referrals for items or services for which payment may be made under the medicare and medicaid programs and certain other government funded programs 
the social security act provides authority to the office of inspector general through civil proceedings to exclude an individual or entity from participation in the medicare and state health programs if it is determined any such party has violated section b b of the social security act 
the company believes that it is in compliance with the federal anti kickback statute 
additionally  the omnibus budget reconciliation act of  often referred to as stark ii  bans physician self referrals to providers of designated health services with which the physician has a financial relationship 
the term designated health services includes  among others  radiation therapy services and in patient and out patient hospital services 
on january   the physician ownership and referral act of became effective in california 
this legislation prohibits physician self referrals for covered goods and services  including radiation oncology  if the physician or the physician s immediate family concurrently has a financial 
table of contents interest in the entity receiving the referral 
the company believes that it is in compliance with these rules and regulations 
a range of federal civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities 
one of the most significant is the federal false claims act  which prohibits the submission of a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure a reimbursement from a government sponsored program 
in recent years  the federal government has launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices which violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws 
claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government  through a whistleblower or qui tam action 
the company believes that it is in compliance with the federal false claims act  however  because such actions are filed under seal and may remain secret for years  there can be no assurance that the company or one of its affiliates is not named in a material qui tam action 
legislation in various jurisdictions requires that health facilities obtain a certificate of need con prior to making expenditures for medical technology in excess of specified amounts 
four of the company s existing customers were required to obtain a con or its equivalent 
the con procedure can be expensive and time consuming and may impact the length of time before gamma knife services commence 
con requirements vary from state to state in their application to the operations of both the company and its customers 
in some jurisdictions the company is required to comply with con procedures to provide its services and in other jurisdictions customers must comply with con procedures before using the company s services 
the company s gamma knife units contain cobalt radioactive sources 
the medical centers that house the company s gamma knife units are responsible for obtaining possession and user s licenses for the cobalt source 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with the various rules and regulations that affect its businesses 
insurance and indemnification the company s contracts with equipment vendors generally do not contain indemnification provisions 
the company maintains a comprehensive insurance program covering the value of its property and equipment  subject to deductibles  which the company believes are reasonable 
the company s customer contracts generally contain mutual indemnification provisions 
the company maintains general and professional liability insurance 
the company is not involved in the practice of medicine and therefore believes its present insurance coverage and indemnification agreements are adequate for its business 

table of contents employees at december   the company employed twelve people on a full time basis 
none of these employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement and there is no union representation within the company 
the company maintains various employee benefit plans and believes that its employee relations are good

risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors could affect our future business  results of operations  cash flows or financial position  and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward looking statements contained in this report 
the company s capital investment in each gamma knife unit is substantial each gamma knife unit requires a substantial capital investment 
in some cases  we contribute additional funds for capital costs and or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing  maintenance  insurance and property taxes 
due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers  there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment 
the market for the gamma knife is limited there is a limited market for the gamma knife 
due to the substantial costs of acquiring a gamma knife unit  we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of gamma knife procedures 
as of december  there were operating gamma knife units in the united states  of which units are owned by us  and units in operation worldwide 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at a significant number of sites in the future 
the company has a high level of debt the company s business is capital intensive and it has traditionally financed each gamma knife with debt 
the combined long term debt and present value of capital leases totals  and is collateralized by the gamma knife units and other assets  including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the company and any end user of the financed equipment 
this high level of debt may adversely affect the company s ability to secure additional credit in the future  and as a result may affect operations and profitability 
if default on debt occurs in the future  the company s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan  to seize the gamma knife unit with respect to which default has occurred  and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default 
the market is competitive there are currently three companies in addition to our company that actively provide alternative  non conventional gamma knife financing to potential customers 
we believe there are no competitor companies that currently have more than six gamma knife units in operation 
the company s relationship with elekta  the manufacturer of the leksell gamma knife unit  is non exclusive  and in the past the company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a gamma knife unit directly from elekta 
in addition  the company may continue to lose future sales to such customers and may also lose future sales to its competitors 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units 
there are alternatives to the gamma knife there are several methods of radiosurgery including the modified linear accelerator as well as conventional neurosurgery that compete against the gamma knife 
each of the medical centers targeted by the company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery modality instead of a gamma knife 
in addition  neurosurgeons who are primarily responsible for referring patients for gamma knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons  instead opting for invasive surgery 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or gamma knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth 
the company s revenue could decline if federal reimbursement rates are lowered the amount reimbursed to medical centers for each gamma knife treatment may decline in the future 
the reimbursement decrease may come from federally mandated programs ie  medicare and medicaid or other third party payor groups 
fifteen of the company s existing contracts are reimbursed by the medical center to the company on a fee per use basis 
the primary risk under this type of contract is that the actual volume of procedures could be less than projected 
however  a significant reimbursement rate reduction may result in the company restructuring certain of its existing contracts 
there are also six contracts where the company receives revenue based directly on the amount of reimbursement received for procedures performed 
revenue under those contracts and any future contracts with revenue based directly on reimbursement amounts will be impacted by any reimbursement rate change 
some of the company s future contracts for gamma knife services may have revenue based on such reimbursement rates instead of a fee for service basis 
there can be no assurance that future changes in healthcare regulations and reimbursement rates will not directly or indirectly adversely affect the company s gamma knife revenue 
new technology and products could result in equipment obsolescence there is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment 
new and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the gamma knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate 
during  elekta introduced an upgraded gamma knife which costs approximately million plus applicable tax and duties 
this upgrade includes an automatic positioning system aps  and therefore involves less health care provider intervention 
in early  elekta introduced a new upgrade  the model c 
twelve of our existing gamma knife units include aps and eight of our existing gamma knife units are upgradeable 
the cost to upgrade existing units to the new model c gamma knife with aps is estimated to be approximately  to  depending on the current gamma knife configuration 
the failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our contract with elekta may limit our activities ashs owns of gkf and the minority interest is owned by elekta 
the operating agreement governing gkf contains restrictions on our ability to engage in financing 
table of contents alternative stereotactic radiosurgery equipment to the gamma knife 
in the past  we and elekta have had different interpretations of the scope of this restriction in the operating agreement 
if elekta s position were to prevail  this provision may limit the activities that ashs undertakes in the future 
item properties the company s corporate offices are located at four embarcadero center  suite  san francisco  california  where it subleases approximately  square feet for  per month 
this sublease runs through may a portion of the office space is subleased through may to two third parties for approximately  per month 
the company anticipates that it will remain in its current office space through a new direct lease upon the expiration of its current sublease

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation 
table of contents reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition to be two areas that required the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the following are our critical accounting policies in which management s estimates  assumptions and judgments most directly and materially affect the financial statements revenue recognition the company has only one revenue generating activity  which is the operation of gamma knife units by gk financing  llc gkf  an owned subsidiary of the company 
revenue is recognized when services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured  on either a fee per use or revenue sharing basis 
the company has contracts with fee per use hospitals and six retail hospitals 
under both of these types of agreements  the hospital is responsible for billing patients and collection of fees for services performed 
revenue associated with installation of the gamma knife units  if any  is a part of the negotiated lease amount and not a distinctly identifiable amount 
the costs  if any  associated with installation of the units are amortized over the period of the related lease to match revenue recognition of these costs 
for fee per use agreements  revenue is not estimated because these contracts provide for a fixed fee per procedure  and are typically for a ten year term 
revenue is recognized at the time the procedures are performed  based on each hospital s contracted rate 
there is no guaranteed minimum payment 
costs related to operating the units are charged to costs of operations as incurred  which approximates the recognition of the related revenue 
revenues under fee per use agreements are recorded on a gross basis 
gkf has six agreements that are based on revenue sharing 
these can be further classified as either turn key arrangements or net revenue sharing arrangements 
for the four turn key sites  gkf is solely responsible for the costs to acquire and install the gamma knife 
in return  gkf receives payment from the hospital in the amount of its reimbursement from third party payors 
revenue is recognized by the company during the period in which the procedure is performed  and is estimated based on what can be reasonably expected to be paid by the third party payor to the hospital 
the estimate is primarily determined from historical experience and 
table of contents hospital contracts with third party payors 
these estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the expected payment amount 
the company also records an estimate of operating costs associated with each procedure during the period in which the procedure is performed 
costs are determined primarily based on historical treatment protocols and cost schedules with the hospital 
the company s estimated operating costs are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the actual operating costs 
revenue for turn key sites is recorded on a gross basis  and the operating expenses the company reimburses to the hospital are recorded in other operating costs 
under net revenue sharing arrangements the hospital shares in the responsibility and risk with gkf for the capital investment to acquire and install the gamma knife 
unlike our turn key arrangement  gkf s lease payment under a net revenue sharing arrangement is a percentage of revenue less operating costs 
payments are made by the hospital  generally on a monthly basis  to gkf based on an agreed upon percentage allocation of income remaining after all operating expenses are deducted from cash collected 
revenue is recognized during the period in which the procedure is performed  and is determined based on the net reimbursement amount that gkf expects to receive from the hospital for each gamma knife procedure 
under the net revenue sharing arrangement  the percent of revenue received by gkf is recorded net of costs to provide a gamma knife treatment 
this estimate is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted as necessary to more accurately reflect the expected payment amount 
revenue from retail arrangements amounted to approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on possible losses relating to the company s revenue sharing customers 
the company receives reimbursement from the customer based on the customer s collections from individuals and third party payors such as insurance companies and medicare 
receivables are charged against the allowance in the period that they are deemed uncollectible 
if the company s net accounts receivable estimates for revenue sharing customers as of december  changed by as much as based on actual collection information  it would have the effect of increasing or decreasing revenue by approximately  general during the years ended december   and  of the company s revenue was derived from its gamma knife business 
total revenue 
table of contents increase increase decrease decrease medical services revenue in thousands number of gamma knife procedures average revenue per procedure medical services revenue increased in compared to and increased in compared to the increase in both and is due to an increase in the number of gamma knife units in operation 
the company had twenty one  eighteen and seventeen gamma knife units in operation at december   and  respectively 
gamma knife revenue increased  and  in and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
the increase was due to three new gamma knife units that began operation during and the full year inclusion of one new gamma knife unit that began operation during  which offset a decrease in revenue from gamma knife units in operation more than one year 
the increase compared to was primarily due to one new gamma knife units that began operation during and the full year inclusion of three new gamma knife units that began operation during  which offset a decrease in revenue for gamma knife units in operation more than one year 
the number of gamma knife procedures in increased by compared to due to the increase in the number of gamma knife units in operation  as well as a increase in procedures from gamma knife units in operation more than one year 
the increase in the number of gamma knife procedures in compared to was due to the increase in the number of gamma knife units in operation  which offset a decrease in procedures from gamma knife units in operation more than one year 
revenue per procedure decreased in and increased in compared to the prior years 
the company s contracts generally have different procedure rates because their investment basis varies  so revenue per procedure can vary year to year depending primarily on the mix of procedures performed at certain locations 
the decrease per procedure in is primarily due to lower average procedure rates collected at two of the company s retail sites

maintenance and supplies costs increased  in compared to  and increased  in compared to the increase in compared to was primarily due to the expiration of the warranty period on one gamma knife unit and the full year inclusion of maintenance on two gamma knife units whose warranty period expired during the previous year 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the expiration of the warranty period on two gamma knife units and the full year inclusion of three gamma knife units whose warranty period expired during depreciation and amortization increased  in compared to  and increased  in compared to the increase in was primarily due to the addition of three new gamma knife units that commenced operation during first  second and third quarters of and a full year of depreciation on one new gamma knife units that started operation during the increase in was due to the addition of one new gamma knife unit that commenced operation during third quarter and a full year s depreciation on three gamma knife units that started operation in other direct operating costs as a percentage of medical services revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase of  in compared to was primarily due to increased operating costs related to the company s two additional retail gamma knife units that started operation during and higher insurance costs due to additional gamma knife units in operation  which were partially offset by lower marketing and promotion costs

table of contents interest expense increase increase in thousands decrease decrease interest expense percentage of revenue the company s interest expense decreased  in compared to  and decreased  in compared to the decrease in was due to lower interest expense on the company s more mature gamma knife units and the completion of debt service on two gamma knife units 
this was partially offset by additional interest expense on the financing of the company s three new gamma knife units that started operation during  and the refinancing of one gamma knife unit that had previously been paid off
