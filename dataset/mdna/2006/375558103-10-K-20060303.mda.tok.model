item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of gilead 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
executive summary gilead experienced another year of increasing revenues  profits and cash flows due to the successful launches and adoption of our drugs for the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the hepatitis b virus hbv  as well as the maintenance of our product sales for ambisome 
we have been able to increase market share due to the favorable and consistent safety and efficacy profile that has been demonstrated to date on our products  including viread  truvada and emtriva 
the increase in market share on our hiv products helped contribute to a increase in hiv product sales to billion from  while the continued adoption of hepsera increased product sales to million  an increase of from we intend to build upon the successes of these products by continuing to engage in long term clinical studies to differentiate our products 
additionally  within the hiv franchise  we intend to work with patients  physicians and key opinion leaders to educate them on the benefits of earlier treatment that is expected to help expand the treated patient population 
as we continue to gather positive data on the safety and efficacy of truvada  which we launched in various european countries in  we believe that the uptake of truvada will continue to be a driving force in increasing our hiv product sales 
over the last few years  we have also focused on creating what we believe is a solid foundation for long term growth by looking for opportunities to acquire or in license innovative technologies or drug candidates and developing those technologies alongside our in house initiatives 
in  we entered into a collaboration with japan tobacco inc japan tobacco and made advances on the phase clinical trial based on the hiv integrase inhibitor we licensed from them 
additionally  we demonstrated bioequivalence on a formulation of the fixed dose combination of truvada and bristol myers squibb company s bms sustiva the triple product as well as began dosing patients in a phase study with the hcv drug candidate we licensed from achillion pharmaceuticals 
internally  we made significant progress in the enrollment of two phase studies comparing the efficacy and safety of tenofovir versus hepsera in patients with hbv 
we also filed an investigational new drug application in december for gs  one of our internal integrase clinical candidates  and initiated a phase clinical study in healthy volunteers in february we intend to sustain the long term growth of our business by continuing to discover and commercialize new drugs in the antivirals area  especially in the hiv and hepatitis c virus hcv areas 
we also plan on exploring other therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs for licensing or acquisition opportunities that fit with our core competencies and complement our long term growth strategy 
part of our ability to grow consists of building a strong global organization 
during the year  we relocated our european commercial  medical and administrative headquarters from france to the united kingdom  thereby uniting these functions with the regulatory  safety and information technology groups already headquartered in the united kingdom 
we also made strategic expansion of our global sales and marketing activities for as our revenues continued to increase  and as we continued to see collection improvements in certain european regions over the last two years  cash and investment management continued to be an important priority 
in addition to re examining our cash and investments portfolio  investment policies and strategies  we also used our cash for various collaborative activities 
during the third quarter of  along with royalty pharma  we purchased the royalty interest owned by emory university in emtricitabine for million 
furthermore  in december  leveraging our strong financial position and results  we entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the term loan  which we used to facilitate a one time repatriation of qualified foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act ajca  resulted in a million income tax benefit that we recorded in we have not yet drawn any amounts under the revolving facility but the facility will give us flexibility to use our 
table of contents funds for future corporate development initiatives  including licensing opportunities and potential acquisitions  while allowing us to meet our ongoing working capital and infrastructure needs 
our focus for will be to continue building upon our current infrastructure  continuing to advance our drug candidates through the clinic and executing on our operational goals of promoting our products safety and efficacy data to drive higher patient adoption 
we also intend to build a stronger working relationship with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd roche with respect to tamiflu under our amended agreement to jointly drive more effective marketing and supply chain strategies to meet the increasing demand for tamiflu 
we will also focus significant resources in preparing for the launch of the co formulated truvada sustiva product in the united states 
moreover  we are working with merck co  inc merck and bms on arrangements to launch the co formulated product outside of the united states 
finally  we will continue to strengthen our global infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base  including expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities as well as upgrading our facilities and information systems 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals and our tax provision 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products  distributor fees  government rebate programs such as medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment 
estimates for distributor fees are based on contractually determined fixed percentages of sales 
estimates for government rebate programs and cash discounts are based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates and our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs 
estimates for product returns  including new products  are based on an on going analysis of industry and historical return patterns 
this includes monitoring the feedback that we receive from our sales force regarding customer use and satisfaction  reviewing inventory data available to us through our inventory management agreements with us wholesalers to assist us in monitoring channel inventory levels  purchasing third party data to monitor prescriptions as well as  for new products  comparing these products against our other products with same or similar sales channels 
further  we monitor the activities and clinical trials of our key competitors and assess the potential impact on our future sales and return expectations where necessary 
expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf lives for these products in the united states ranges from months for truvada and hepsera  and up to months for viread and ambisome 
if conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives 
this would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or new incentives are offered 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and where there is no continuing involvement by gilead  are recognized on the earlier to occur of when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents revenues from non refundable up front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product are recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed 
in accordance with the specific terms of gilead s obligations under these types of arrangements  revenues are recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development or manufacturing period 
revenues associated with substantive at risk milestones are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we record write downs of the value of our inventory based on review of the historical quantity of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process and expectations of production and inventory levels 
we also perform quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches 
we generally do not record inventory write offs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations 
prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected levels of our product sales incorporating the emtricitabine technology 
the net book value of our prepaid asset was determined using our best estimate of relevant future product sales available at the time we consummated the transaction  however  we review at least annually  the expected future performance of our products and indicators that would support a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset 
we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense 
we review our royalty rate at least annually and would adjust the rate based on any significant new facts or circumstances that may arise 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during 
table of contents  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros on a straight line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cro 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
gilead extensively outsources its clinical trial activities and usually performs only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose phase study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of viread  truvada  hepsera and emtriva 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro at any point in time during the contract  regardless of payment status 
amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we would have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
such adjustments were made in the fourth quarter of and when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore  we released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in an income tax benefit for and of approximately million and million  respectively 
similarly  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets for which we have no valuation allowance  we would increase the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  changes in our international organization  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of gilead s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them 

table of contents results of operations total revenues we had total revenues of billion in  billion in and million in included in total revenues are product sales  royalty revenue and contract revenue including revenue earned from manufacturing collaborations 
product sales product sales consisted of the following in thousands change change hiv products viread truvada emtriva hiv products ambisome hepsera vistide daunoxome total product sales total product sales increased by in compared to and in compared to  in each case  primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of our hiv products 
a significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
we use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in euro 
this reduces  but does not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
hiv products viread  truvada and emtriva were approved for sale in the united states in october  august and july  respectively 
viread  truvada and emtriva were approved for sale in the european union in february  february and october  respectively 
sales of truvada commenced in the united states in the third quarter of and country specific launches in europe began in hiv product volume increased by in compared to and by in compared to hiv product volume growth in the united states were and in and  respectively  whereas volume increases outside the united states were and in and  respectively 
viread sales of viread in remained relatively consistent with sales levels in  resulting from the continued strong performance of viread offset by the impact of patients switching from a viread containing regimen to one containing truvada in countries where truvada is available 
sales of viread in increased by compared to  primarily driven by volume increases in the united states and across most european countries 
truvada sales of truvada increased in the united states in  the first full year of truvada sales 
truvada patients come primarily from patients new to therapy  and secondarily  from patients switching from other regimens  including those containing viread or emtriva 

table of contents emtriva sales of emtriva in decreased by compared to  primarily driven by the impact of patients switching from an emtriva containing regimen to one containing truvada in countries where truvada is available 
in  we expect sales from our hiv products to be in the range of billion to billion 
this does not include future product sales  if any  that may result should the triple product be approved for commercial sale in the united states  as we cannot predict whether the triple product will be approved by the us food and drug administration fda 
ambisome ambisome product sales increased by in compared to  primarily driven by an increase in overall sales volume of  partially offset by lower pricing in most regions outside of the united states 
product sales increased by in over the prior year due primarily to higher sales volume outside of the united states and a stronger european currency  partially offset by lower pricing in many regions outside of the united states 
our discussion of us ambisome product sales relates solely to our sales of ambisome to astellas pharma inc astellas  as successor to fujisawa usa  inc  which are recorded at our manufacturing cost 
in  due to greater manufacturing efficiencies  our per unit manufacturing cost for ambisome decreased  thereby decreasing revenues reported for our sales to astellas 
royalties that we earn on sales of ambisome by astellas are discussed under royalty revenue below 
as a result of pricing pressures in europe and increased competition  we expect ambisome product sales for to be in the range of million to million 
hepsera sales of hepsera increased by in compared to and by in compared to  primarily driven by sales volume growth in both europe and the united states 
volume also increased with respect to our sales of hepsera to glaxosmithkline gsk 
we sell hepsera to gsk at our manufacturing cost in connection with gsk s distribution activities in asia 
royalties we earn on sales of hepsera by gsk are recorded as royalty revenue 
we expect hepsera sales for to be in the range of million to million  which takes into account the impact of existing and potential competitor products in the united states and europe 
royalty revenue we recorded royalty revenues of million in  compared with million in and million in during this three year period  our most significant sources of royalty revenues were from sales of tamiflu by roche and sales of ambisome in the united states by astellas 
in november  gilead resolved its dispute with roche relating to our development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between gilead and roche 
as part of the terms of the dispute resolution  gilead and roche have established joint committees to oversee manufacturing  commercial and pandemic planning for the product and we have the option to co promote tamiflu in specialized areas in the united states 
related to the dispute resolution  roche also paid us million that we recognized as royalty revenue in  which consisted of million relating to disputed royalties from to  million relating to the reimbursement of the contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties  and million relating to the updating of royalties payable to gilead for the first nine months of based on current year royalty rates instead of the prior year s effective royalty rate 
excluding the amounts received in connection with the dispute resolution  the significant year over year increase for tamiflu royalties in was primarily due to higher royalties received from roche for higher tamiflu sales caused by the significant flu season  particularly in japan  and the fulfillment of orders for pandemic 
table of contents readiness supplies in certain countries in royalty revenues earned from roche  including the amounts recognized from the dispute resolution in  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
comparing to  royalty revenues earned from sales of tamiflu by roche also increased substantially due to a severe influenza epidemic in the united states from late through early increased awareness and discussion about the supply of influenza treatments in also increased roche s sales of tamiflu and consequently  our royalties in as it is difficult to estimate third party product sales  similar to our other out licensing arrangements other than our arrangement with astellas  under which royalties are recorded one month in arrears  we record royalty revenue from roche one quarter in arrears 
royalty revenue earned on sales of ambisome by astellas have remained consistent at million for both and  a slight increase from million in contract revenue total contract revenues were million in  compared with million in and million in in  contract revenues consisted primarily of a million milestone payment earned from osi pharmaceuticals  inc osi  as successor to eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc  upon its first commercial sale of macugen in the united states in as well as revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects 
in  contract revenues consisted primarily of million in research and milestone revenue earned from osi  which included million recognized upon the filing of new drug applications by osi in europe and the united states for macugen 
cost of goods sold and product gross margin the following table indicates total product sales and cost of goods sold in thousands and product gross margin change change total product sales cost of goods sold product gross margin our product gross margin for was slightly lower than that for due to product mix changes as patients continue to switch from viread  a higher margin product  to truvada 
our product gross margin was relatively consistent from to as the positive impact of improvements in certain manufacturing processes and a favorable foreign currency environment in was offset by changes in product sales mix 
as a result of royalty pharma and our purchase of the royalty interest owned by emory in emtricitabine in july  we capitalized million in prepaid royalties  representing our share of the million purchase price 
in the third quarter of  we have begun to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales 
we recorded royalties to royalty pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to royalty pharma s ownership interest in the underlying emory royalty interest 
although we expect this transaction to have a favorable impact on our emtricitabine product gross margin in the long term  the impact to our overall product gross margin in was not significant 
we expect our product gross margin in to be generally consistent with that of this excludes the impact of the potential launch of the triple product as we cannot predict whether or when the triple product will be approved by the fda 
although we expect the launch of the triple product will decrease our product gross margin percentage  there will be no impact to our net profit 
this is due to the fact that as the majority owner of 
table of contents our joint venture with bms  we will consolidate of the triple product revenue 
however  we will earn the full product margin of the truvada portion of the triple product but earn zero product margin on the sustiva portion of the triple product 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes our r d expenses into these major components in thousands change change research clinical development pharmaceutical development total r d expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  clinical studies performed by cros  materials and supplies  licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our r d activities are separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs 
clinical development costs include costs for phase   and clinical trials 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis costs 
the million increase in r d expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to a million payment made to emory in connection with the amendment of our existing license agreement with emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis b indication  a million payment made to japan tobacco related to the execution of our hiv integrase license agreement for gs  increased salaries from additional headcount of million and increased clinical and product development activities associated with our hcv  hbv and hiv programs 
the payments made to emory and japan tobacco were expensed as the underlying technology was incomplete and had no alternative future use  and in the case of emory  no significant r d activities are expected in the next several years 
the million increase in r d expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  million in research and license fees paid in relation to the hcv collaboration agreements we entered into with achillion pharmaceuticals achillion and genelabs technologies genelabs during  as well as increased cro costs of million associated with increased clinical activities 
the payments made to achillion and genelabs were expensed as the underlying technology had no alternative future use 
the increase in r d expenses compared to was partially offset by a decrease in spending due to the discontinuation of our two internal programs  gs and gs  that focused on the development of certain hiv investigational products 
our r d expenses included a reimbursement to gilead of million from the settlement of a contractual dispute with a vendor 
in  we expect r d expenses to increase over levels reflecting increased spending on our internal and collaborative r d efforts relating to our expectation that pipeline products will progress into more advanced clinical trials  increased headcount as well as the impact of expensing share based payments 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes our sg a expenses in thousands change change selling  general and administrative 
table of contents sg a expenses for were million  an increase of million compared to the significant increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  an increase in market research  speaker s programs and symposia costs of million  million of severance and relocation expenses associated with the relocation of our european commercial  medical and administrative headquarters from france to the united kingdom  an increase in medical education costs of million  an increase in journal advertising costs of million  as well as a general expansion of our sales and marketing activities worldwide 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million as a result of higher collections in certain european countries 
sg a expenses in were million compared to million for  which includes the reclassification of phase clinical trial expenses to r d as mentioned above 
the significant increase in expenses in compared to is primarily related to an increase in salaries of million due largely to higher headcount  an increase in consulting fees of million related to sarbanes oxley compliance and business strategy consulting  as well as an increase in costs of million relating to speaker s programs  grants and journal advertising 
the remainder of the increase in sg a expenses in as compared to was generally due to our increased global marketing efforts and expanded infrastructure required to support the growth of our business 
during  as part of our infrastructure investments  we implemented a reorganization of our sales and marketing functions into a newly created commercial division 
in conjunction with this reorganization  we created and filled the new position of executive vice president  commercial operations responsible for global commercial operations and strategy for our product portfolio 
in  we expect sg a expenses to increase primarily due to the anticipated costs associated with launching and supporting truvada in various countries  costs related to our ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through hiring and promotional programs as well as the impact of expensing share based payments 
purchased in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of the net assets of triangle pharmaceuticals  inc triangle completed in january  we recorded purchased in process r d expenses of million in the first quarter of the charge was due to triangle s incomplete r d programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the value of the purchased in process r d was determined by estimating the related future net cash flows between and using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of 
this discount rate is a significant assumption and is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted upward for the risks associated with the projects acquired 
the projected cash flows from the acquired projects were based on estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects considering the stage of development of each potential product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of each product  the life of each potential commercialized product and associated risks including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound including obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 

table of contents a summary of these programs at the acquisition date follows  updated for subsequent changes in status of development program description status of development estimated acquisition date fair value in millions emtricitabine for hiv a nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of hiv replication in patients 
four phase studies were completed prior to the acquisition date 
us marketing approval received from the fda in july for emtriva and european union approval received from the european commission in october emtricitabine tenofovir df fixed dose combination for hiv therapy a fixed dose co formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine 
as of the acquisition date  work had not commenced on the potential co formulation except to the extent that work on emtricitabine as a single agent was progressing 
in march  applications for marketing approval were submitted in the united states and european union and in august marketing approval in the united states was received from the fda for truvada  the fixed dose co formulation of tenofovir and emtricitabine 
marketing approval in the european union was received in february and sales commenced later during the first quarter 
amdoxovir for hiv a purine dioxolane nucleoside that may offer advantages over other marketed nucleosides because of its activity against drug resistant viruses as exhibited in patients with hiv infection 
this program was in phase trials at acquisition date 
in  we terminated the licensing agreement with emory university and the university of georgia research foundation  inc and development was discontinued 
clevudine for hbv a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that has been shown to be an inhibitor of hbv replication in patients chronically infected with hbv 
this program was in phase trials at acquisition date 
in august  the licensing agreement with bukwang pharm 
ind 
co  ltd was terminated and development was discontinued 
emtricitabine for hbv an inhibitor of hbv replication in patients chronically infected with hbv 
this program was in phase trials at acquisition date but was completed as of december  we continue to evaluate our strategy for the development of emtricitabine for the hepatitis b indication 
we currently do not expect to undertake any significant r d activities in the next several years 

table of contents asset impairment during  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million on certain of our long lived assets  primarily leasehold improvements  manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
this non cash charge was driven by the decision in december to terminate our liposomal r d activities in san dimas and discontinue the daunoxome product line 
the impairment was based on our analysis of the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the affected assets as compared to their carrying value 
as the carrying value exceeded the related estimated undiscounted cash flows  we wrote the carrying value of the long lived assets down to their estimated fair value 
in  subsequent to our decision to discontinue the daunoxome product line  we received unanticipated requests in europe asking gilead to reconsider selling daunoxome 
as a result of these requests  management decided to continue selling this product in certain countries although we are evaluating our supply and sales strategy with respect to daunoxome 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  the new cost basis for the impaired assets was not adjusted for these new facts and circumstances 
gain on warrant pursuant to our agreement with eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc eyetech  as predecessor to osi  that we entered into in march  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share 
in january  eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of million 
at that time  the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the black scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of and a discount rate of 
at the end of the first quarter of  we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held  shares of eyetech common stock 
in the second quarter of  we sold all of the eyetech shares we owned and realized a gain of approximately million  which is included in interest and other income  net  in make whole payment on convertible debt redemption in october  we called for the redemption of all our outstanding convertible senior notes due december  on november  the convertible senior notes were called under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of gilead common stock exceeding certain thresholds 
the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes was million 
the convertible senior notes were redeemable at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus a cash payment equal to accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and a cash make whole payment equal to per  principal value of the notes less interest actually paid or accrued and unpaid from the date of issuance of the notes to the redemption date 
interest on the convertible senior notes ceased to accrue on the redemption date  and the only remaining right of the holders thereafter was to receive the redemption payment  including accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date and the make whole payment 
alternatively  note holders could elect to convert their notes into shares of gilead common stock at a price of per share  or shares of gilead common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
holders of substantially all of the outstanding notes converted their notes into shares of gilead common stock prior to the november  redemption date 
as a result of these conversions   shares of common stock were issued to these note holders 
in connection with the redemption  we made aggregate make whole payments of million to note holders 
interest and other income  net we recorded interest and other income  net of million in  million in and million in the increases in and are primarily attributable to the higher cash balances over the previous year 
interest income in will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates and the level of our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 

table of contents interest expense we incurred interest expense of million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in over is primarily attributable to the conversion of our million convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock in november the decrease in over is primarily due to the conversion of our million convertible subordinated notes into shares of our common stock in december we expect interest expense in to increase as a result of the interest we will be paying under the million five year term loan that we entered into in december minority interest in joint venture the minority interest reflects bms s interest in the operating results of our joint venture with bms in the united states 
the operations of the joint venture commenced in with activities primarily focusing on the the triple product and achieving bioequivalence with the various co formulations 
with the achievement of a successful formulation in the fourth quarter of  we expect a significant increase in activities during  especially if fda and commercial approval is obtained 
provision for benefit from income taxes our provision for benefit from income taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate of differs from the us federal statutory rate of due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the united states and in jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states and the benefit derived from the qualifying dividend made under the american jobs creation act ajca  partially offset by state taxes 
on october   the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca allows for a deduction of of certain qualified foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
we elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings that were repatriated in the earnings repatriation resulted in a one time tax provision benefit of approximately million  which includes the reversal of the deferred tax liability previously accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of million at december  the effective income tax rate of differs from the us federal statutory rate of due generally to the recognition of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and certain earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the united states and in jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states  partially offset by state taxes 
the tax benefit in includes the reversal of our valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets 
in december  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit related to our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance against the assets and recorded a tax benefit of million 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows 
partially offsetting our recorded tax benefit was income tax expense associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries  foreign losses at lower tax rates and the non tax deductibility of purchased in process r d 
we had significant net operating loss carryforwards that were used to reduce our us tax liability 
excluding the benefit relating to the reversal of our valuation allowance and the write off of purchased in process r d  our effective tax rate for was

these increases were partially offset by million increase in income taxes payable primarily due to higher profitability partially offset by tax benefits from employee stock plans  million increase reflecting the current portion of the million term loan that we entered into in december  and 
table of contents million increase in other accrued liabilities including increases in accruals related to medicaid rebates  royalty expenses  sales and marketing expenses and rent expenses  partially offset by the decrease in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the us dollar strengthened against the euro 
working capital at december  was billion compared to billion at december  significant factors that resulted in an increase in working capital were million increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales of viread in the united states and europe and sales from our new product  truvada  launched in the united states in the latter half of  and million increase in inventories primarily due to an increase in the purchase of raw materials and the production of viread and truvada inventory to meet increasing sales demand 
the increases in the working capital were partially offset by million decrease in current deferred tax assets that was primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income  and million increase in current liabilities including million increase in medicaid rebate obligations  million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to royalties received from roche  million increase in the liability associated with the fair value of our forward currency contracts as the us dollar continued to weaken against the euro  and million increase in accounts payable primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of viread and truvada sales growth 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increases in our net income  which has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of cash 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  of million is primarily attributed to our product sales growth  increased cash collections from customers as well as payments received related to the resolution of our dispute with roche  partially offset by the million of prepaid royalties that we made to emory 
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities primarily related to purchases  sales and maturities of available for sale securities and capital expenditures 
we used million of cash for investing activities during  compared to million during and million in increases in cash used in investing activities were primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents balances year over year 
net cash used in investing activities for purchases of available for sale securities increased in to million  compared to million in and million in cash used in investing activities was higher in compared to  due to the million we paid for the acquisition of triangle s net assets and the million paid for the purchase of our foster city facilities 
capital expenditures made in related primarily to expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities as well as upgrading our facilities 
our capital expenditures in were primarily for facilities improvements  including approximately million associated with the completion of our pilot plant in foster city to be used to develop our drug processes and prepare materials to supply clinical trials  as well as additional spending for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to accommodate our growth 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to proceeds from our million term loan as well as stock option exercises and stock purchases made under our employee stock plans 
we also received million  million and million in  and  respectively  relating to stock option exercises and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our r d efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies  and defense costs associated with  settlements of and adverse results of litigation 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings  such as from our universal shelf registration statement filed in december for the potential issuance of up to million of our securities 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure that it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in december  we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks  to provide for a five year million senior credit facility 
the million facility comprised an uncollateralized million term loan and an uncollateralized million revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from the term loan were used in december to facilitate a qualified intercompany cash dividend distribution of million from gilead biopharmaceutics ireland corporation gbic  a wholly owned irish subsidiary of gilead  to the us parent company  gilead sciences  inc  as part of the repatriation of our qualified foreign earnings under the provisions of the ajca 
under the terms of the million term loan  the minimum principal payments to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter  beginning march   are million 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the million revolving credit facility 
the capacity of the revolving credit facility will increase to a maximum of million as the million term loan is repaid 
we have the ability to irrevocably cancel any unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility  in whole or in part 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of capital and operating leases  as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments  purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items and clinical trials contracts 
the following table summarizes our enforceable and legally binding obligations  future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless 
table of contents of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  the following table summarizes these contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years term loan capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital commitments purchase obligations clinical trials total at december   we had long term debt which consists of the million  year term loan that we entered into in the fourth quarter of at december   we had firm capital project commitments of approximately million relating to facilities improvement 
in addition  we have budgeted significant capital expenditures for  mainly due to anticipated increased infrastructure needs and higher r d spending 
we may have more capital spending in future years 
at december   we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items 
the amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements 
actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
although most of our contracts with cros are cancelable  we generally have not cancelled such contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  beginning with the first quarterly period after june   with early adoption permitted 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance date for sfas r such that we are allowed to adopt the new standard effective january  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition under sfas r 
we adopted sfas r on january  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have determined that we will adopt the modified prospective method and continue to use the black scholes option valuation model 
based on our preliminary analysis  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our income statement and earnings per share 
we currently estimate the impact to be approximately to per diluted share for sfas r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported in the statement of cash flows as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our sales denominated in foreign currency  as well as foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
we use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
in recent years  foreign currency exchange fluctuations have both positively and negatively impacted product sales and gross margin  however  the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedge program 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  all contracts have maturities of one year or less 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per us dollar 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands currency notional amount average rate fair value british pound euro australian dollar total the total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  compares with a total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  the significant increase in the notional amount of outstanding contracts from to is primarily attributed to the projected increase in product sales over the forecasted periods 
interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to the investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  
table of contents liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 
the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest generating assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  dollars in thousands years ending december  total fair value at december  thereafter assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt  including current portion average interest rate other long term obligations  including current portion average interest rate long term debt consists of the million  year term loan that we entered into in the fourth quarter of the average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
under the terms of the loan  the minimum principal amount to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter  beginning march   is million 
interest is accrued at a rate of libor plus a tiered contractual rate of up to basis points 
we can prepay the term loan at any time in whole or in part  together with accrued interest on the prepaid principal  without penalty or premium 
any outstanding interest or principal at december is payable on demand 
other long term obligations consist of capital leases and operating leases net of noncancelable subleases 
the interest portion of payments due is included 
international credit risk our accounts receivable balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales for viread and truvada in the united states and europe 
in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  italy  portugal and spain  our accounts receivable balances are significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled million  of which million was more than days past due based on contractual terms of the receivables 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally have not required collateral
