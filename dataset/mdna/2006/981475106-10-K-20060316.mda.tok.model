item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data  and with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion may contain forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward looking statements 
some factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward looking statements are described in item a risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the marketing and sale of marine and aviation fuel products and related services on a worldwide basis 
in our marine segment  we offer marine fuel and related services to a broad base of maritime customers  including international container and tanker fleets and time charter operators  as well as to the united states and foreign governments 
in our aviation segment  we offer aviation fuel and related services to major commercial airlines  second and third tier airlines  cargo carriers  regional and low cost carriers  corporate fleets  fractional operators  private aircraft  military fleets and to the united states and foreign governments 
we compete by providing our customers value added benefits including single supplier convenience  competitive pricing  the availability of trade credit  price risk management  logistical support  fuel quality control and fuel procurement outsourcing 
our revenue and cost of sales are significantly impacted by world oil prices as evidenced by our revenue and cost of sales increases year over year 
however  our gross profit is not necessarily impacted by the change in world oil prices as our profitability is driven by gross profit per unit which is not directly correlated to the price of fuel 
therefore  in a period of increasing or decreasing oil prices  our revenue and cost of sales would increase or decrease proportionately but our gross profit may not be negatively or positively impacted by such price changes 
as such  we believe that gross profit  rather than revenue  is the better indicator of our business performance 
in our marine segment  we purchase and resell fuel  and act as brokers for others 
profit from our marine segment is determined primarily by the volume and gross profit achieved on fuel resales and by the volume and commission rate of brokering business 
profit from our aviation segment is directly related to the volume and the gross profit achieved on fuel sales 
we do not act as brokers for our aviation segment 
our profitability in both segments also depends on our operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debts 
we may experience decreases in future sales volume and margins as a result of deterioration in the world economy  or in the shipping or aviation industries  natural disasters such as the impact of hurricane katrina and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  because fuel costs represent a significant part of a vessel s and airline s operating expenses  volatile and or high fuel prices can adversely affect our customers businesses  and consequently the demand for our services and our results of operations 
see item a risk factors of this form k 
in april  we acquired tramp oil 
this acquisition forms part of our marine segment and was accounted for as a purchase 
accordingly  the results of operations of this acquisition were included with our 
table of contents results since the date of acquisition 
in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement with signature flight support corporation through the acquisition of a equity interest in pafco 
from january  to december   we used the equity method of accounting to record our share of the earnings and losses of this aviation joint venture 
in addition  the amortized interest expense on the non interest bearing promissory note was also included in net income from this aviation joint venture 
effective january   with the implementation of fin no 
 we consolidated pafco s financial position and results of operations  after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts  transactions and profits 
reportable segments we have two reportable operating segments marine and aviation 
corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage  where possible  or on other factors according to the nature of the activity 
financial information with respect to our business segments is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenue and related costs of sales  bad debts  deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
accounts and notes receivable and allowance for bad debts credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed by each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee 
the credit committees are responsible for approving credit limits above certain amounts  setting and maintaining credit standards  and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon a customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to most of our customers 
accounts receivable are deemed past due based on contractual terms agreed with our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market and industry conditions affecting our customers  and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
accounts and notes receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see item a risk factors of this form k 

table of contents derivatives we enter into derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in marine and aviation fuel  and to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs 
we also enter into derivatives in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuation in interest rates 
all derivatives are recognized as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the balance sheet at fair market value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for fair value hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge and the hedged item are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
for cash flow hedges  changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income oci in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when the hedging relationship over an extended period of time is determined to be ineffective 
we assess hedge effectiveness based on total changes in the fair market value of our hedging instruments and hedged items and any ineffectiveness is recognized in the statement of income 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
for additional information on derivatives  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this form k 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents our cost in excess of net assets of the acquired companies and the joint venture interest in pafco 
we recorded identifiable intangible assets for customer relationships existing at the date of the acquisitions 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over their useful lives that range from five to seven years 
we account for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other provisions  sfas no 
states that goodwill shall not be amortized prospectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed annually at year end or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit  which is the same as our reporting segment  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting segment is estimated using discounted cash flow and market capitalization methodologies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when fuel deliveries are made and title passes to the customer  or as fuel related services are performed  provided that there is a persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
income taxes income tax expense is provided for using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation 
table of contents allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as compared to million at december  additionally  at december   we had short term investments of million with duration of typically less than days 
our primary use of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  is to fund the purchase of inventories and increased receivables to support business growth relating to sales of fuel to our customers 
we are usually extended unsecured trade credit from our suppliers for our fuel purchases  however  certain suppliers require us to provide a letter of credit 
our ability to fund fuel purchases  obtain trade credit from our suppliers  and provide letters of credit is critical to our business 
increases in oil prices negatively affect liquidity by increasing the amount of cash needed to fund fuel purchases as well as reducing the amount of fuel which can be purchased on an unsecured credit basis from our suppliers 
historically  we have not required significant capital investment in fixed assets for our businesses as we subcontract fueling services and maintain inventory at third party storage facilities 
however  we have committed to an enterprise integration project which will result in a new company wide information system conversion to support our business growth and complexity of global activities 
the total capital expenditures related to this project are currently estimated to be million of which million was incurred in and the balance of million is expected to be incurred in the estimated capital expenditures include capitalized internal resources in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
our business is funded through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our cash on had fluctuate primarily based on operating cash flow  most significantly  the timing of receipts from our customers and payments to our suppliers 
our revolving credit facility permits borrowings of up to million with a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are 
table of contents reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility totaled million and our issued letters of credit totaled million 
the revolving credit facility contains certain operating and financial covenants with which we are required to comply 
our failure to comply with the operating and financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party  and impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facility 
we also have a separate million credit line for the issuance of letters of credit from one of the banks participating in our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million under this credit line 
higher interest rates can have a negative effect on our liquidity due to higher costs of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
to mitigate this risk  in part  we entered into interest rate swaps in march in the amount of million  which reduces our exposure to increase in interest rates 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate on borrowing under the revolving credit facility adjusting for the interest rate protection arrangements was per annum 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for as compared to million for this positive change in cash flows from operating activities of million was primarily due to an increase in our net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily as a result of the timing of cash receipts from customers and cash payments to suppliers 
during  net cash used in investing activities was million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for this million negative change in cash flows from investing activities was due to million purchase of short term investments  million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures and net cash received in april of million as a result of the acquisition of tramp oil 
partially offsetting was million proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
for  net cash provided in financing activities was million as compared to million for this positive change in cash flows from financing activities of million was primarily due to net proceeds of million from our public offering of shares  million decrease in the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the million repayment of assumed bank loans and bank overdrafts from tramp oil in partially offsetting was a million decrease in the borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million lower proceeds from exercise of stock options 
working capital at december  was million  representing an increase of million from working capital at december  our accounts and notes receivable amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in accounts and notes receivable of million was due to increases in fuel prices and sales volume 
at december   the allowance for bad debts of million increased by million as compared to december  inventories of million  at december   decreased million from december  this decrease was entirely due to a decrease in our inventory levels since our inventory carrying cost per unit increased significantly from to as of december   prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million primarily due to increases in receivables related to transaction taxes and derivative contracts  prepaid fuel and deferred tax assets 
our current liabilities  other than short term debt  increased million primarily due to an increase in accounts payable related to increased fuel prices  an increase in payables related to derivatives  and an increase in 
table of contents accrued compensation expenses  partially offset by a decrease in customer deposits 
short term and long term debt decreased by million  primarily due to net repayments of million under our revolving credit facility 
stockholders equity amounted to million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity of million was mainly due to net proceeds of million from the public offering of our common stock and million in earnings  million in exercise of stock options and related income tax benefit  and million amortization of unearned deferred compensation  partially offset by the declaration of dividends 
we believe that available funds from existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility  together with cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to obtain financing are based on currently available information 
to the extent this information proves to be inaccurate  or if circumstances change  future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity would be adversely affected 
factors that may affect the availability of trade credit  or other financing  include our performance as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities  the state of worldwide credit markets  and our levels of outstanding debt 
in addition  we may decide to raise additional funds to respond to competitive pressures or changes in market conditions  to fund future growth  or to acquire businesses 
we cannot guarantee that financing will be available when needed or desired on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our significant contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements are set forth below

recent accounting pronouncements accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
in september  the emerging issues task force issued issue no 
eitf  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
the eitf concluded that inventory purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty should be combined for accounting purposes if they were entered into in contemplation of each other 
the eitf provided indicators to be considered for purposes of determining whether such transactions are entered into in contemplation of each other 
guidance was also provided on the circumstances under which nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value 
eitf will be effective in reporting periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf will cause inventory purchases and sales under buy sell transactions  which were recorded gross as purchases and sales  to be treated as inventory exchanges in consolidated statements of income 
we do not expect the affects of the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position
