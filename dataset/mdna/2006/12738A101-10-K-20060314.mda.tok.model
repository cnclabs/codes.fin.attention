item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
another area that requires subjective and complex judgments is the liability and expense relating to the corporation s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the assumptions used in the determination of pension liability  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation  are evaluated by management  reviewed with the plan actuaries and updated as appropriate 
notes a and m in the notes to consolidated financial statements contain additional information relating to these issues 
the corporation s postretirement benefit plans are also discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a third area of the financial statements requiring difficult  subjective  and complex judgments is the review of the investments in the securities portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
in  the eitf of the fasb issued  the meaning of other than temporary impairment in its application to certain investments 
as a result of this release  the corporation is required to review its investment portfolio and determine if it has impairment losses that are other than temporary 
in making its determination  management considers the following items the length of time and extent to which the current market value is less than cost  evidence of a forecasted recovery  financial condition and the industry environment of the issuer  downgrades of the securities by rating agencies  whether there has been a reduction or elimination of dividends or interest payments  and whether the corporation has the intent or ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery of fair value 
notes a and c in the notes to consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain additional information relating to this issue 
sources and availability of funds the materials essential to the business of the corporation and its subsidiaries consist primarily of funds derived from deposits and other borrowings in the financial markets 
the availability of funds is primarily dependent upon the economic policies of the government  the economy in general and the institution s ability to compete in its markets

item a risk factors there are many risks and uncertainties related to the corporation s business that may impair our business operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
any of the following risks could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed 
see forward looking statements above 
our loan portfolio mix may subject us to greater operational and financial risk 
commercial real estate cre is cyclical and poses risks of possible loss due to concentration levels and similar risks of the asset  especially since the corporation has approximately of its portfolio in cre loans 
our cre loans have also grown approximately since the banking regulators are giving cre lending greater scrutiny  and may require banks with higher levels of cre loans to implement improved underwriting  internal controls  risk management policies and portfolio stress testing  as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for possible losses and capital levels as a result of cre lending growth and exposures 
see supervision and regulation 
competition in the banking industry is intense 
in our primary market areas  we compete with other commercial banks  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  mortgage companies and insurance companies operating locally and elsewhere 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than us and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
our profitability depends on our continued ability to compete effectively in our market areas 
our success depends on local economic conditions 
to a certain extent  our success depends on the general economic conditions of the geographic markets we serve in the states of mississippi  alabama and tennessee 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
adverse changes in the economic conditions of the southeastern united states in general or any one or more of our local markets could negatively impact our results of operations and our profitability 
changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses could affect our profitability 
management maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses based upon  among other things  historical experience  an evaluation of local and national economic conditions  regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality  current trends regarding the volume and severity of past due and problem loans  the existence and effect of concentrations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of credit  and results of regulatory examinations 
based on such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectibility of the respective loan portfolios 
although we believe that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future losses 
future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ or adverse developments arise with respect to nonperforming or performing loans 
material additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would result in a decrease in our net income and our capital 
the banking industry is heavily regulated 
we are subject  in certain respects  to regulation by the federal reserve  the fdic  the occ  and the state banking departments in the states in which our branches are located 
our success depends not only on competitive factors but also on state and federal regulations affecting banks and bank holding companies 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors  not shareholders 
the ultimate effect of recent and proposed changes to the industry s regulations cannot be predicted 
regulations now affecting us may be modified at any time  and there is no assurance that such modifications  if any  will not adversely affect our business 
changes in monetary policy could adversely affect our profitability 
our results of operations are impacted by credit policies of monetary authorities  particularly the federal reserve board 
in light of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets  particularly the continuing threat of terrorist acts and the current military operations in the middle east  no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates  deposit levels  loan demand or the business and earnings of the corporation 
furthermore  the actions of the united states and other governments in response to terrorist threats may result in currency fluctuations  exchange controls  market disruption and other adverse effects 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our income 
our profitability depends to a significant extent on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments 
changes in interest rates could also adversely affect the income of some of our non interest income sources 
for example  if mortgage interest rates increase  the demand for residential mortgage loans will likely decrease  having an adverse effect on our mortgage loan fee income 
we may face risks with respect to future expansion and acquisitions or mergers 
we continuously seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions and may engage in de novo branch expansion  acquisitions or mergers in the future 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance that such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities  including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock  in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisition  our integration efforts will be successful or that our company  after giving effect to the acquisition  will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 

table of contents 
index to financial statements combining acquired companies may be more difficult  costly  or time consuming than we expect 
our current growth plans include the acquisition of other financial institutions 
it is possible that the integration process for these acquisitions could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  procedures and policies that would adversely affect the corporation s ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
if the corporation has difficulties with the integration process  it might not achieve the economic benefits expected to result from the acquisition 
as with any merger of banking institutions  there also may be business disruptions that cause the corporation to lose customers or cause customers to remove their deposits or loans from the corporation s bank and move their business to competing financial institutions 
our ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends 
our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital 
the ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to national banks that are regulated by the occ 
if we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock

loans and risk descriptions real estate loans the bank originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled million or approximately of the loan portfolio 
the bank originates commercial real estate loans of up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the corporation s policy to originate these loans only to carefully selected borrowers and on properties in the market area 
of primary concern in commercial real estate lending are the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in commercial real estate lending  cadence  nbc and enb have historically sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
the bank originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in its lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these loans 
loans for multi family or more units residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income generating properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans cadence offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million  or of total loans  at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers and because the terms and normally higher interest rates on such loans help maintain a profitable spread between the average loan yield and the cost of funds 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
cadence intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
the bank makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms generally not exceeding five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed

introduction and management overview nbc capital corporation is a financial holding company that owns cadence bank  na cadence or the bank  formerly national bank of commerce nbc  which operates in eastern mississippi  tuscaloosa and hoover  alabama  and memphis  tennessee 
we provide full financial services  including banking  trust services  mortgage services  insurance and investment products 
our stock is listed on the american stock exchange amex under the ticker symbol of nby 
for purposes of the following discussion  the words the corporation  we  us and our refer to the combined entities of nbc capital corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  cadence  unless the context suggests otherwise 
early in  the board of directors adopted a six point strategic plan that provided management with its primary direction during this plan focused on growing our corporate footprint  earning assets and net income 
the key points of this plan included improving margins  supplementing several management slots to support overall growth  launching a de novo bank in a high growth market  continuing acquisition activity  reviewing opportunities to expand the equity base  and changing the bank s name so that it could operate under one name throughout its entire market area 
during  we accomplished four of the six strategic items listed in the previous paragraph 
we were able to fill the management slots referenced in item above 
during the year  management improved margins from for to for on october   we changed the name of the bank to cadence 
the name was changed primarily to allow us to continue to expand into growth markets and to operate under a single bank structure 
we selected the name cadence because it is unique in our current and future markets and eliminates the confusion in those markets over the former nbc name 
also  on october   we opened a de novo branch of cadence in hoover  alabama  a part of the birmingham msa 
finally  effective after the close of business on november   enterprise national bank enb in memphis  which we acquired in through the acquisition of enterprise bancshares  inc  merged into cadence 
this merger allowed the achievement of operational and marketing efficiencies and provided cadence customers with a seamless branch system in alabama  mississippi and tennessee 
these last three events were significant steps in our strategic plan to expand into more rapidly growing markets 
the one time charges associated with these strategic objectives reduced our fully diluted earnings per share by approximately nine cents during during  four major external factors significantly impacted our operating results 
first  the federal reserve continued to raise short term interest rates 
second  the overall economy in the mississippi market remained somewhat soft  however  the tennessee and alabama markets provided good loan growth for the year 
this loan growth was especially strong during the second half of the fourth quarter 
third  the overall credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio improved during fourth  discover card acquired the pulse card clearing network  of which the bank was a member 
the first two factors impacted our net interest income for the year 
the increase in rates improved the yield on earning assets 
also  we experienced a increase in average earning assets 
the third factor  related to the credit quality of the bank s loan portfolio  allowed us to reduce the provision for loan losses during the year below the levels that were budgeted 
the fourth factor  relating to the sale of the pulse card clearing network  provided a one time pre tax gain of approximately  which is included in other income and resulted in a six cent increase in fully diluted earnings per share 
during the third quarter of  hurricanes katrina and rita badly damaged the gulf coast region of mississippi 
the damage was widespread and extended as far north as interstate we do not have operations in that part of the state 
as a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements result  other than a brief period of power outage and some slight water damage from the heavy rain  we did not experience any significant damage or disruption of operations 
however  the impact of the storms on the region s economy  including the cost of fuel and natural gas  is affecting and will continue to affect our entire area of operations for an unknown period of time 
also  building materials and labor costs are expected to rise as construction activity increases in the gulf area 
at the date of this report  we have not seen any negative impact from these factors on our customer base  however  we took such factors into account in determining the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended december  we will continue to monitor this situation closely during for  our net interest margin was  compared to for increasing interest rates during improved the yields on loans  as the loan portfolio  which is composed of approximately variable rate loans and fixed rate loans  repriced upward 
to a lesser extent  the improved rate environment also had a positive impact on the return on our investment portfolio  as the yields on the investment portfolio increased by basis points over our overall cost of funds also increased during as the rising rate environment put pressure on deposit and other borrowing rates 
however  the increase in the cost of funds did not increase as much as the improvement to our yields on average earning assets 
until the fourth quarter of  the overall loan demand  especially in the mississippi market  had been relatively low due to low rates and a soft local economy 
even though loan demand was not robust  we did not compromise our underwriting standards 
therefore  as of december   management regarded the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio as very good  evidenced by the lower provision for loan losses during the year  which is discussed more fully below 
during  non interest income  exclusive of gains on securities  decreased from million in to million in the growth of non interest income has been and continues to be one of our major strategic goals 
the components and reasons for the decline in this category are discussed more fully below 
non interest income accounted for of revenues in and in this change was impacted more by the growth in total interest income in approximately  than by the slight decline in non interest income 
another goal of management in was to continue to control the level of non interest expenses 
during  total non interest expenses increased by million  or 
approximately million of the increase came from the non interest expenses of enb 
we included enb s non interest expenses for all of  however  for  we only included them for the period of april through december also  the name change and the merger of enb into cadence added another million in one time pre tax charges in during  we reported net income of million  or per fully diluted share  compared to million  or per fully diluted share  for currently  management expects  based on available information  that interest rates will continue to trend upward during the first half of and then level out for the remainder of the year 
management also anticipates that the overall economy in our mississippi markets will improve  because there have been several recent announcements concerning new companies that have expanded or are planning to expand and or begin production in the near future 
also  some of our markets qualify for significant tax credits for facilities and equipment constructed or purchased in as a result of the hurricane katrina relief act 
we expect strong growth to continue in both the memphis and tuscaloosa markets and anticipate that our october entry into the birmingham msa will provide us with another strong growth market 
we based our projections  budgets and goals on these expectations 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  they could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of our operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and the provision for loan losses 
we have a number of strategic objectives set for at the regular shareholder meeting later this year  we plan to ask shareholders to change our corporate name to cadence financial corporation 
the change will align our corporate name with that of the bank and further leverage the brand being created in our markets 
the new cadence brand is part of an overall marketing and business strategy that we expect to create both operational and marketing efficiencies 
during  we plan to open two new branches in the memphis market and one in the birmingham market 
we have identified another high growth market and plan to add a de novo bank in that market during see the section entitled  subsequent events 
also  as we have noted in the past  we are continuing to review potential acquisition candidates to increase our share in existing markets and to expand our footprint into new markets 
finally  we will continue to assess the possibility of issuing additional equity in to support our growth objectives 
in addition  we will continue our current efforts to grow loans and increase our margin in with the potential improvement in the mississippi market  the continued strong growth in tennessee and alabama and the addition of a de novo bank in another growth market  management believes that we will be able to achieve solid loan growth in the expansion of the margin  however  will be a more difficult objective to obtain 
the flat yield curve presents a significant 
table of contents 
index to financial statements obstacle 
also  as is normal in a rising rate environment  the cost of deposits lagged behind the increase in yield on the asset side of the balance sheet 
during the fourth quarter we began experiencing pressure on the deposit pricing as the need to grow deposits increased with the growth in our loan portfolio 
however  management believes that we can continue to improve our margin in in addition  we will continue to look for ways to grow non interest revenues 
the planned growth in the memphis market and the expansion into the birmingham msa should provide a new customer base for our other banking products and services 
we will also continue our efforts to control non interest expenses in and will look for ways to improve our efficiency ratio 
however  management estimates that strategic growth plans will cost approximately nineteen cents per fully diluted share in subsequent events on february   we filed an application to open a de novo bank in the nashville  tennessee msa 
this bank will be located in the cool springs area of williamson county  just south of nashville 
pending approval by the office of the comptroller of the currency  the bank should open during the first quarter of and will operate as a branch of cadence bank  n 
a 
this is in keeping with our strategy of continuing to expand our franchise into fast growing markets 
significant events on october   we changed the name of the bank to cadence  and on october   we opened a cadence branch in hoover  alabama the fifth largest city in alabama and a part of the birmingham msa 
we changed the bank s name primarily to allow us to continue to expand into new growth markets  as nbc is a common bank name throughout the southeastern region 
we chose the name cadence because it is unique in our current markets and it eliminates the confusion with the nbc name in our current and future metropolitan markets 
the name change also allows us to operate under a single bank structure 
effective after the close of business on november   enb was merged into cadence 
this merger allows for the achievement of operational and marketing efficiencies and provides cadence customers with a seamless branch system in alabama  mississippi and tennessee 
critical accounting policies our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to united states generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in our annual report  including management s letter to shareholders and this management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand our financial condition and results of operations 
it is management s opinion that the areas of the financial statements that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and therefore contain the most critical accounting estimates  are the provision for loan losses and the resulting allowance for loan losses  the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  and issues relating to other than temporary impairment losses in the securities portfolio 
our provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
the allowance is maintained at a level deemed adequate by the board of directors after its evaluation of the risk exposure contained in our loan portfolio 
the senior credit officers and the loan review staff perform the methodology used to make this determination of risk exposure on a quarterly basis 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of our ability to collect the loan and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value 
if the senior credit officers and loan review staff determine that impairments exist  specific portions of the allowance are allocated to these individual loans 
we group all other loans into homogeneous pools and determine risk exposure by considering the following list of factors this list is not all inclusive and the factors reviewed may change as circumstances change historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
additionally  management looks at specific external credit risk factors that bring additional risk into the portfolio 
for the period ended december   we identified the following five external risk factors increasing fuel energy cost  potential slowdown in the real estate market  increased risk associated with commercial real estate credits  the still undetermined impact of the storms on consumers  and continuing higher unemployment rates in certain counties in the mississippi market 
these external risk factors will be re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
management makes its estimates of the credit risk in the portfolio and the amount of provision needed to keep the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level using what management believes are the best and most current sources of information available at the time of the estimates  however  many of these factors can change quickly and with no advance warning 
if management significantly misses its estimates in any period  it can have a material impact on the results of operations for that period and for subsequent periods 

table of contents 
index to financial statements another area that requires subjective and complex judgments is the liability and expense relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we maintain several benefit plans for our employees 
they include a defined benefit plan  a defined contribution plan  a k plan and a deferred compensation plan 
we make all contributions to these plans when due and  at the end of the year  we had no unfunded liabilities under any of these plans 
the defined benefit plan is the only plan that requires multiple assumptions to determine the liability under the plan 
this plan has been frozen to new participants for several years 
management evaluates  reviews with the plan actuaries  and updates as appropriate the assumptions used in the determination of pension liability  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and increases in future compensation 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on the plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future benefits that is recorded on the financial statements as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
in selecting the expected rate of return  management  in consultation with the plan trustees  selected a rate based on assumptions compared to recent returns and economic forecasts 
we consider the current allocation of the portfolio and the probable rates of return of each investment type 
in selecting the discount rate  management  in consultation with actuarial consultants  selected rates based on rates of return on long term  high quality bonds having maturity dates corresponding as closely as possible to the expected retirement dates of the employees and the subsequent payout periods of the respective plans 
to reflect the appropriate rate  based on the corresponding bonds  management reduced the discount rate from in  to in and to in we used an expected rate of return of for and and for this equates to an average rate of return over the three year period of 
from a historical perspective  the rates of return on the plan were for  for and for this equates to an average actual rate of return of over this three year period 
in summary  the plan outperformed expectations over the last three years 
additionally  our philosophy has been to fund the plan annually to the maximum amount deductible under the internal revenue service rules 
as a result  as of december   the plan has a prepaid benefit cost of million 
at december   we had a current accumulated benefit obligation of approximately million and plan assets with a fair value of approximately million 
detailed information on our pension plan and the related impacts of these changes on the liability and expense recorded in our financial statements can be found in note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the third area that requires subjective and complex judgments on the part of management is the review of the investments in the securities portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
in  the eitf of the fasb issued  the meaning of other than temporary impairment in its application to certain investments 
as a result of this release  we must review our investment portfolio and determine if it has impairment losses that are other than temporary 
in making its determination  management considers the following items the length of time and extent to which the current market value is less than cost  evidence of a forecasted recovery  financial condition and the industry environment of the issuer  downgrades of the securities by rating agencies  whether there has been a reduction or elimination of dividends or interest payments  and whether we have the intent or ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery of fair value 
on november   the fasb issued fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp fas will be effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after december  in making our review under this pronouncement  based on the market values provided by a third party  we had a significant number of securities that were impaired  by definition 
we reviewed each of these securities to determine if any of the impairments were other than temporary 
using the criteria listed above  management made the determination that as of december   none of the impairments were other than temporary 
in the normal course of business  our wholly owned subsidiary bank  cadence  makes loans to related parties  including our directors and executive officers and their relatives and affiliates 
we make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  the loans are consistent with sound banking practices and within applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
please see note o in the notes to consolidated financial statements and our proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of generally prohibits loans to executive officers 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans that the bank makes to executive officers are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act

r  share based payment 
this statement requires compensation expense related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements 
because of this required change  during the third quarter of  the compensation committee of the board of directors reviewed our stock option plan and the options outstanding 
at the time of the review  all outstanding options that were not vested were out of the money 
this situation existed for much of in the opinion of the committee  the options were not achieving their intended purposes of incentive compensation and employee retention 
as a result  the committee recommended to the board of directors that all outstanding options be vested to avoid recognizing future expense for options that were not achieving their intended results 
at its august meeting  the board of directors voted to vest all outstanding options  effective august  results of operations net income for was million  or per diluted share  an increase from million  or per diluted share in and million  or per diluted share in return on average equity was in  in  and in return on average assets was in and  and in net interest income nii  the primary source of our earnings  represents income generated from earning assets  less the interest expense of funding those assets 
nii increased by in and in changes in nii may be divided into two components  first  the change in average earning assets volume component and second  the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  nii increased by million  or  from million in to million 
the inclusion of enterprise for the full year of versus only nine months of accounted for million of the increase 
during  the net interest margin was  compared to for net interest margin is net interest income divided by average earning assets 
this represents an increase of basis points in margin for also  average earning assets increased from billion in to billion in this increase amounted to million  or 
in analyzing the rate component of nii  from to  we gained basis points of yield on our earning assets 
however  during this period  the cost of funds increased by basis points 
as the federal reserve continued to raise rates during  our loan portfolio  which is composed of approximately variable rate loans  was positively impacted 
from to  the yield on loans increased from to 
the increases in interest rates also had a positive impact on other earning assets as the yield on federal funds sold increased from to  and the yield on the investment securities portfolio increased from to 
the increase in average earning assets is composed of the following average loans increased from million during to million during  average federal funds sold and other interest bearing cash accounts decreased from million during to million during  and the average balance in investment securities increased from million during to million during from to  the average balance of interest bearing deposits increased from million to million  and the cost of these deposits increased from to 
during this same period  the average balance of other borrowings declined from million to million  however  the cost of these borrowings increased from to 
please see the following table for more details 
in  nii increased by million  or  from million in to million 
for the last nine months of  enb contributed approximately million to the total 
during  net interest margin declined from to 
as yields on earning assets continued to decline during the year  the extended period of low rates made it impossible to reduce the cost of funds in an amount sufficient to offset the loss of asset yields 
even though rates began to increase during the second half of  we did not get the full impact of the increase in our loan portfolio approximately of which are variable rate loans because many of our variable rate loans had floor rates 
only with the final rate increase of did the prime rate exceed the level 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the following table shows  for the periods indicated  an analysis of nii  including the average amount of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding during the period  the interest earned or paid on such amounts  the average yields rates paid and the net yield on earning assets on both a book and tax equivalent basis in thousands average balance year ended year ended earning assets loans federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets securities taxable tax exempt totals interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits borrowed funds  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other interest bearing liabilities totals interest for yields earned and rates paid year ended year ended year ended year ended earning assets loans federal funds sold and other interest bearing assets securities taxable tax exempt totals interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits borrowed funds  federal funds sold  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other totals net interest income net yield on earning assets note yields on a tax equivalent basis would be tax exempt securities total earning assets net yield on earning assets we utilized the provision for loan losses to replenish the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet 
after an evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the loan portfolio  management and the board of directors believe that the level of the allowance is adequate 
this is an ongoing process  and we review and determine the amount of the provision quarterly  
table of contents 
index to financial statements using a methodology that over the years has proven to be sound 
the provision for loan losses increased from  in to  in  and decreased in to  of the  increase in   came from the provision for enb 
the decrease in the provision for resulted from an overall improvement in the credit quality in the portfolio 
the details of these improvements are shown in more detail in the following section  entitled financial condition  under the discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
management expects significant loan growth in as the markets in memphis and birmingham continue to expand and a de novo branch is established in another growth market 
considering this expected growth and unknown external factors  management intends to increase the provision for loan losses in at this time  management expects the level of the provision to protect us from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
however  if during the year  any or all of these factors change in direction or speed  we will make the necessary adjustments in the provision to reflect these changes 
non interest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions we collected  including insurance commissions earned by galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cadence 
it has been  and continues to be  one of our strategic focuses to diversify our other income sources so that we can be less dependent on net interest income 
other income has declined slightly from million in to million in and to in the changes in the major categories between and are as follows change service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income mortgage loan fees security gains losses  net bank owned life insurance income other total non interest income declined by  or  from to this decrease resulted from a decline in service charges on deposit accounts of  or  a decline in mortgage loan fees of  or  and a decline in bank owned life insurance income of  or 
the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts largely resulted from an increase in the number of free checking accounts and an overall reduction in the amount of non sufficient funds nsf fees that were generated from our non interest bearing deposit accounts 
as the industry moves toward more free accounts  the service charges generated by these accounts will continue to decline 
the nsf fees declined significantly in january and february  however  they returned to a more normal level following those two months 
it appeared that there was more available cash in our market during the first two months  as people filed their tax returns and received their refunds earlier 
also  several of the tax preparation firms were making loans against tax refunds  thereby getting cash in the hands of the consumer quicker 
two other factors that are having an effect on nsf fee income are the use of debit cards is increasing  which reduces the number of checks written  and many retail establishments are becoming more careful about taking checks at the point of sale 
mortgage fee income continued its decline during the demand for new home loans continues to be strong  however  this has not been enough to offset the decline in the demand to refinance existing mortgage loans 
we are looking for some improvement in this area in as we expand this service into the higher growth markets 
bank owned life insurance income declined as the insurance companies continued to lower their crediting rates as the yields on their general account portfolios continued to decline as older  higher yield assets matured and were replaced by securities with lower yields 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other categories of non interest income 
income from fiduciary activities increased by  or  insurance commissions and fee income increased by  or  other non interest income increased by  or  and other service charges and fees increased by  or 
the increase in income from fiduciary activities resulted from the amount of assets under management and the overall improvement in the equity markets over the past year 
the increase in insurance commissions and fee income resulted from an improvement in both sales volume and the level of profit sharing received from the insurance carriers based on loss experience 
the increase in other service charges and fees and other non interest income was due to a one time gain of  related to our interest in the pulse card clearing network  which was sold during the first quarter of  an increase of  in check card income and a  settlement from the state of mississippi on a road construction project affecting a branch bank 
the increase in check card income resulted from increased usage  as more transactions are processed electronically 
this gain was partially offset by a  decline in income from retail investments and a decline of  in gain on sale of repossessed assets 
all other changes in the other accounts were not material in amount

all of the comparison and discussion concerning the accounts in this paragraph will be exclusive of enb 
as noted in the table above  the largest declines came in the categories of mortgage loan fee income and securities gains 
we will discuss the decline in security gains in the following paragraph 
mortgage loan fee income declined by million  or 
this decline resulted from a significant reduction in mortgage loan refinancing 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased account activity  more uniform application of account based fees and selected fee increases 
insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or 
this increase resulted from a slight increase in sales volume 
other service charges and fees increased by  or 
the majority of this increase came from a  or  increase in fees associated with credit  debit and atm cards 
this resulted from increased usage as the retail customer base grew during the year from the introduction and marketing of free checking accounts 
the other large increase in this category came from retail investment sales  which increased by  or  driven mainly by increased sales volume 
trust department income increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from higher fees related to the impact of the improvement in the equity markets on the value of the assets under management and a increase in the number of accounts under management 
bank owned life insurance income declined by  or  as the insurance companies continued to lower their crediting rates as the yields on their general account portfolios continued to decline as older  higher yield assets matured and were replaced by securities with lower yields 
the decline in the other account was composed of changes in several accounts  none of which were considered material 
we recognized  in securities gains during compared to  in the gains came primarily from selling certain securities that were pre refunded and were within one year of maturity and from some securities being called at a level above their recorded book value 
approximately of the gain was recognized in the first six months of the year 
with a large portion of the available for sale securities portfolio composed of mortgage backed securities  we took advantage of a unique interest rate environment that developed during that period 
that rate environment allowed certain securities to be sold at a gain and replaced with similar securities with yields at or above the level of the securities sold 
this opportunity resulted from the rapid prepayment of some mortgage backed securities  which reduced their yields and average lives and made them attractive at premium prices to short term investors 
we took advantage of this opportunity to improve portfolio yields without extending maturities beyond acceptable levels  and at the same time recognizing gains 
non interest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses  including salaries  bonuses and benefits 
we maintain a formal salary administration program that considers extensive comparative salary data and other indices supplied by a leading outside consulting firm 
this data is utilized to assure that salaries are competitive with comparable jobs in the marketplace 
incentive bonuses were expensed in and paid to employees based on the attainment of predetermined profit goals 
the predetermined profit goals were not reached in and  therefore  no significant bonuses were accrued in either of these years 
overall  we have been successful in our efforts to limit the growth in non interest expenses  as these expenses increased from million in to million in the following table shows the detailed changes in the category 
expenses from enb are included for nine months in and all of  however  enb was merged into cadence in november as a result  separate numbers for enb for are not available

without this bonus accrual  this expense category would have increased only by  or 
this is the result of our continued efforts to control employee cost 
during  employee benefits increased by  or 
approximately of this increase came from the accrued payroll taxes and k contribution matches related to the bonuses and year end incentives 
net occupancy expense increased  or 
this increase came primarily from three sources 
first  included a full year of enb expense while included only nine months 
this accounted for approximately of the increase 
second  was the first full year of the data center expansion depreciation 
third  there were rental increases on some of the properties in memphis and rental expenses associated with the opening of the birmingham de novo branch in october expenses associated with furniture and equipment increased by  or  primarily resulting from the fact that enb s expenses were included for twelve months in and only nine months in other non interest expenses increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from  of expenses associated with the merger of enb and cadence and  of expenses associated with the name change 
additionally during  we incurred approximately  of increased expenses associated with computer services and software amortization  because we changed the core operating system from an ibm environment to a sun micro systems environment 
also during  we incurred approximately  in losses as a result of enb repurchasing loans sold in these increases were partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in accounting and professional fees 
this reduction came from the elimination of one time direct expense to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
also in  we incurred approximately  in expenses associated with the closing of four under performing branches in the mississippi market 
none of the changes in the other expense categories were individually considered to be material 
in comparing and  the fact we purchased enb at the end of the first quarter of must be taken into account

approximately of this increase came from an increase in pension expense 
even though improvement in the equity markets enhanced the returns earned on the plan assets during  the impact of low interest rates on the present value calculation caused the total expense of the plan  as computed by the actuary  to increase 
also  as disclosed in note m in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the discount rate used by the actuary was for and for and the expected rate of return was reduced from in to for net occupancy expense remained relatively unchanged during furniture and equipment expense increased by  or

finally  insurance expense increased by approximately  or 
during  we were insured under a three year policy purchased in we renewed this policy in under a one year contract at a substantially higher premium 
the other accounts included in this category did not have material changes during changes in our income tax expense have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
our effective tax rates were in  in  and in these changes in both years resulted primarily from the mix of income from tax exempt investments and the percentage relationship of tax exempt income to total pre tax income 
the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and our normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements limit our ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments 
in summary  net income decreased from million  or per diluted share  in  to million  or per diluted share  in  and increased to million  or per diluted share  in approximately five cents per diluted share of the decline in came from the enterprise acquisition and approximately three cents came from the expenses incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and the closing of four branches 
in  because of the cost associated with the bank s name change and the merger of cadence and enb  fully diluted earnings per share were reduced by approximately nine cents per share 
this was partially offset by approximately six cents per share from the gain on the sale of the pulse card clearing network and the settlement with the state of mississippi on the impact of a road construction project affecting a bank branch 
all of this netted to a three cent per share reduction in financial condition during  our balance sheet showed an increase in total assets from billion at december   to billion at december  this was an increase of approximately million  or

this was a decline of million  or 
the loan portfolio increased from million at the end of to million at december  the increase during the year was million  or 
the growth in the loan portfolio came during the fourth quarter of as loans increased from million at september  to million at december  this represents an increase of million  or 
this growth came from the memphis  tuscaloosa and birmingham markets 
our mississippi market continues to produce little loan growth 
there were four areas of our loan portfolio that declined during in the area of consumer loans  the softness in the economy  growing non bank competition  the continuation of zero rate loans on new autos and the normal cycling of our student loan portfolio resulted in an overall decline in the consumer loan portfolio of approximately million  or 
in the area of real estate loans  the adjustable rate and purchased mortgage loan portfolios declined by approximately million  or  as adjustable rate mortgages continued to payoff or refinance into fixed rate mortgages 
these declines in the portfolio were more than offset by increases in the commercial real estate portfolio of approximately million  or  in the real estate construction portfolio of approximately million  or  and in the business loan portfolio of approximately million  or 
during  the investment securities portfolio decreased from million to million 
this represented a decrease of million  or 
of this decrease  approximately million represents declines in market values 
the remainder resulted from management only replacing a portion of securities that matured  were paid down or sold in and deploying the remaining funds toward loan growth 
during  the allowance for loan losses decreased by million  or  from million to million 
even though there has been increased competition for good quality credits in our markets  we did not reduce our underwriting standards  and as a result  the quality of the portfolio remains strong

table of contents 
index to financial statements the liability side of the balance sheet increased from billion at december  to billion at december   an increase of million  or 
during  deposits increased by million  or  to billion 
the growth came in the area of non interest bearing deposits  as interest bearing deposits declined during the decline in interest bearing deposits came primarily from the memphis market because we decided not to aggressively pursue deposits in the areas of interest bearing checking and money market savings 
the rates on these accounts have increased more rapidly in this market than in our mississippi and alabama markets 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million  or  from million to million 
approximately million of the increase came from a term repurchase agreement executed in the secondary market 
this term repurchase agreement has a floor and was entered into to protect us against an unexpected downturn in interest rates 
also during  fhlb advances decreased by million  or 
this decline was primarily the result of regularly scheduled principal payments 
as loan demand increases with the continued growth of the memphis and tuscaloosa markets and the establishment of the new birmingham market  we will be a more aggressive seeker of deposits and will continue to look to the wholesale market for appropriate additions to funding 
capital resources and shareholders equity shareholders equity increased from million at the end of to million at the end of during  we generated net income of million  from which we declared approximately million in dividends 
also during the year  the interest rate trends continued upward  causing the market value of the available for sale securities to decrease 
as a result  accumulated other comprehensive income changed from an unrealized loss of  at december  to an unrealized loss of  at december  the million loss in value and the million in dividends offset a substantial portion of the million added to equity by net income 
the capital to asset ratio increased from at december  to at december  peer organizations are traditionally in the to range

current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
at the end of  we maintained an leverage ratio  significantly exceeding the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized financial institution is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes allowance for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes allowance for loan losses of 
at the end of  we had a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
liquidity  inflation and asset liability management liquidity may be defined as our ability to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
we have not experienced any problems with liquidity during and anticipate that all liquidity requirements will be met in the future 
our traditional sources of funds from deposit growth  maturing loans and investments and earnings have generally allowed us to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet our daily operational liquidity needs 
as the result of a million increase in loans and a million increase in deposits  our loan deposit ratio increased from in to in our total funding sources include not only deposits  but also federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
when we include these sources of funding with deposits  our loans to total funding ratio increased in from to 
management s target of loans to total funding ratio is in the range of 
at the current level  we have the ability to fund approximately million in additional loans and remain at the target loans to total funding ratio 
we offer retail repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of our larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
retail repurchase agreements  which we view as a source of funds  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of retail repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts and our asset liability funding policy 
because of the limited amount of retail repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under our control  we do not consider the exposure for this service material 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional fhlb borrowings  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow us to meet our obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   we had the ability to borrow approximately million from the fhlb under the blanket line and had other unused short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
additionally  in december  we entered into a secured line of credit with an upstream correspondent to provide additional liquidity  if needed 
the term of this line of credit is two years 
under the line of credit  we have the ability to borrow up to million for general corporate purposes 
this line increases up to million for acquisition funding 
we have no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the fhlb borrowings 
we do not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity 
we allowed our announced stock repurchase plan to lapse during at december   we did not have the authority to purchase stock in the open market  however  at its january meeting  the board of directors reactivated the plan 
under this plan  management has the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of our common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
any purchases under this program will be made over an unknown period of time  and the necessary funds will be provided from internal sources 
under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  the bank is limited in the amount it can lend to our holding company  and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no loans between the bank and the holding company 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
fluctuations in interest rate and actions of the federal reserve board to regulate the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the higher costs for goods and services 
we believe the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our ability to react to changes in interest rates 
we have maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during this policy focuses on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
we utilize an asset liability management committee that evaluates and analyzes our pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  funding  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for its decision making 
modeling techniques are also utilized to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  our goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
at year end  our balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of total assets and would indicate that we are slightly asset sensitive 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
management believes that interest rates will increase during the first half of and that our current position places us in the correct interest rate risk posture for a rising rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in our best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  they could also be put at significant risk if interest rates move against predictions 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations during the first half of  we did not engage in any non exchange traded contracts such as currency or interest rate swaps 
on september   we entered into a million structured repurchase transaction in the secondary market 
this was a term repurchase transaction with a embedded floor 
the term of the transaction was three years 
it was priced at three month libor plus basis points and reprices every three months 
this transaction is in line with our asset liability strategy and was entered into to help protect us against an unexpected downturn in short term interest rates 
this derivative instrument was accounted for as an embedded derivative under fasb statement no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the corporation does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
during the first half of  the corporation did not engage in any non exchange traded contracts such as currency or interest rate swaps 
on september   the corporation entered into a million structured repurchase transaction 
this was a term repurchase transaction with a embedded floor 
the term of the transaction was three years

this transaction is in line with our asset liability strategy and was entered into to help protect the corporation against an unexpected downturn in short term interest rates 
this derivative instrument was accounted for as an embedded derivative under fasb no 
as the corporation continues to enhance its asset liability management  it will continue to look for opportunities to protect itself from unexpected changes in interest rates 
this is likely to be done by using interest rate swaps 
finally  the corporation has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which can either reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels

index to financial statements in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative within months within months within years total of interest earning assets interest earning assets loans investment and mortgage backed securities federal funds sold and other interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowed funds sensitivity gap dollar amount percent of total interest earning assets the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a positive cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider effective interest rate management an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor its irr  the corporation s risk management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
the corporation first prepares a base strategy  which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or most likely interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
interest rate risk is managed based upon the corporation s tolerance for interest rate exposure and the resulting effect on net interest income and the economic value of equity 
a balance sheet and income statement simulation model is prepared monthly  using current month end data 
a base case simulation is prepared monthly using current month growth trends  projected forward and a flat rate forecast 
two additional interest rate shock simulations are prepared  one showing rates 
table of contents 
index to financial statements rising basis points and one showing a basis point decline in rates 
it is the policy of the corporation that a basis point shock in rates should not cause the projection of net interest income to change by more than and cause the economic value of equity to change by more that than and 
the december model reflects net interest income under this scenario increasing by with a basis point upward shock of rates and decreasing if rates are shocked down basis points 
at december   a basis point immediate increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decline in market value of equity  and a basis point instant decrease would have resulted in a decrease in market value of equity 
at december   the corporation is within policy on both of these tests and management believed that changes in net interest income and market value of equity  as reflected in the corporation s models  were acceptable
