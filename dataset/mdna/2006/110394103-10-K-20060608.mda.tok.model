risk factors and our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years  and  and the related notes thereto  all of which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview this executive overview only includes what management considers to be the most important information and analysis for evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
it provides the context for the discussion and analysis of the financial statements which follows and does not disclose every item bearing on our financial condition and operating performance 
general we are a leading provider of helicopter transportation services to the worldwide offshore oil and gas industry with major operations in the us gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we also have operations  both directly and indirectly  in most of the other major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including alaska  australia  brazil  china  egypt  kazakhstan  malaysia  mexico  nigeria  russia  trinidad and turkmenistan 
additionally  we are a leading provider of production management services for oil and gas production facilities in the us gulf of mexico 
as of march   we owned or leased aircraft including eight aircraft held for sale  and our unconsolidated affiliates operated an additional aircraft throughout the world excluding those aircraft leased from us 
we conduct our business in two segments helicopter services and production management services 
the helicopter services segment conducts its operations through seven business units north america  south and central america  europe  west africa  
table of contents southeast asia  other international  and eh centralized operations 
during fiscal year  our north america  south and central america  europe  west africa  southeast asia  other international and eh centralized operations business units contributed      and  respectively  of our gross revenue 
our production management services segment contributed the remaining of our gross revenue in fiscal year our operating revenue depends on the demand for our services and the pricing terms of our contracts 
we measure the demand for our helicopter services in flight hours 
demand for our services depends on the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
we believe that our customers exploration and development activities are influenced by actual and expected trends in commodity prices for oil and gas 
exploration and development activities generally use medium size and larger aircraft on which we typically earn higher margins 
we believe that production related activities are less sensitive to variances in commodity prices  and accordingly  provide more stable activity levels and revenue stream 
we estimate that a majority of our operating revenue from helicopter services is related to the production activities of the oil and gas companies 
helicopter services are seasonal in nature  as our flight activities are influenced by the length of daylight hours and weather conditions 
the worst of these conditions typically occurs during the winter months when our ability to safely fly and our customers ability to safely conduct their operations  is inhibited 
accordingly  our flight activity is generally lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our helicopter contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
generally  our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics 
in addition  our standard rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally charged to the customer 
we also derive revenue from reimbursements for third party out of pocket costs such as certain landing and navigation costs  consultant salaries  travel and accommodation costs  and dispatcher charges 
the costs incurred that are rebilled to our customers are presented as reimbursable expense and the related revenue is presented as reimbursable revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
our helicopter contracts are for varying periods and in certain cases permit the customer to cancel the charter before the end of the contract term 
these contracts provide that the customer will reimburse us for cost increases associated with the contract and are cancelable by the customer with notice of generally days in the us gulf of mexico  to days in europe and days in west africa 
in north america  we generally enter into short term contracts for twelve months or less  although we occasionally enter into longer term contracts 
in europe  contracts are longer term  generally between two and five years 
in south and central america  west africa  southeast asia and other international  contract length generally ranges from three to five years 
at the expiration of a contract  our customers often negotiate renewal terms with us for the next contract period 
in other instances  customers solicit new bids at the expiration of a contract 
contracts are generally awarded based on a number of factors  including price  quality of service  equipment and record of safety 
an incumbent operator has a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on its relationship with the customer  its knowledge of the site characteristics and its understanding of the cost structure for the operations 
maintenance and repair expenses  training costs  employee wages and insurance premiums represent a significant portion of our overall expenses 
our production management costs also include contracted transportation services 
we expense maintenance and repair costs  including major aircraft component overhaul costs  as the costs are incurred 
as a result  our earnings in any given period are directly impacted by the amount of our maintenance and repair expenses for that period 
in certain instances  major aircraft components  primarily engines and transmissions  are maintained by third party vendors under contractual arrangements 
under these agreements  we are charged an agreed amount per hour of flying time 

table of contents as a result of local laws limiting foreign ownership of aviation companies  we conduct helicopter services in many foreign countries through interests in affiliates  some of which are unconsolidated 
generally  we realize revenue from these foreign operations by leasing aircraft and providing services and technical support to those entities 
we also receive dividend income from the earnings of some of these entities 
for additional information about these unconsolidated affiliates  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
market outlook worldwide demand for hydrocarbons is expected to continue to grow for the foreseeable future 
this growth  driven largely by economic expansion  is expected to result in sustained strength in oil and natural gas prices  driving further increases in offshore exploration and development activity by our customers 
we believe this increase in offshore exploration and development activity is also likely to lead to growth in production related activities as these development projects come on stream 
as a result of the current commodity price environment  we have experienced an increase in aircraft fleet utilization in all of our present markets and expect this trend to continue 
in addition  as operators increasingly pursue prospects in deepwater and push further offshore  we expect demand for medium and large helicopters to be further stimulated 
in particular  we expect growth in demand for additional helicopter support in north and south america  west africa and asia  including the caspian sea region 
we expect that the relative importance of our southeast asia and other international business units will continue to increase as the major oil and gas companies increasingly focus on prospects outside of north america and the north sea 
this growth will provide us with opportunities to add new aircraft to our fleet  as well as opportunities to redeploy aircraft from weaker markets into markets that will sustain higher rates for our services 
currently  helicopter manufacturers are indicating very limited supply availability during the next three years 
we expect that this tightness in aircraft availability from the manufacturers and the lack of suitable aircraft in the secondary market  coupled with the increase in demand for helicopter support  will result in upward pressure on the rates we charge for our services 
at the same time  we believe that our recent aircraft acquisitions and commitments position us to capture a portion of the upside created by the current market conditions 
current activity levels in the gulf of mexico are at or near all time highs 
in the near term  we also believe that the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita will continue to result in higher activity levels as operators repair facilities and work to bring production back on line 
while contracts in the north sea are generally long term  we have experienced a trend of increased spot market contracting of helicopters as exploration activity has increased in the north sea 
our other international operations have experienced high customer demand for aircraft to support new and ongoing operations  and we expect this trend to continue 
due to the current high levels of fleet utilization  we have experienced  along with other helicopter operators  some difficulty in meeting our customers needs for short notice exploration drilling support  particularly in remote international locations 
despite our expectations of growth in demand for helicopter support  our operations in nigeria and a south american country may be negatively affected as a result of our remedial actions taken in connection with the internal review  as discussed in more detail below under investigations 

table of contents overview of operating results the following table presents our operating results and other income statement information for the applicable periods fiscal year ended march  in thousands gross revenue operating revenue reimbursable revenue total gross revenue operating expense direct cost reimbursable expense depreciation and amortization general and administrative gain on disposal of assets curtailment gain total operating expense operating income earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net interest expense  net loss on extinguishment of debt other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross revenue increased to million  an increase of  for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in gross revenue was noted in both our helicopter services segment and our production management services segment 
helicopter services contributed to most of the increase with improvements for north america  resulting from an increase in flight hours and rates  and improvements in europe  resulting from higher rates and new contracts 
our operating expenses for fiscal year increased to million  an increase of  from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher costs associated with higher activity levels  higher labor costs  higher fuel rates which are generally recovered from our customers and higher professional fees related to the internal review and doj investigations 
in addition  we had a gain on disposal of assets of million for fiscal year compared to a gain on disposal of assets of million for fiscal year as a result of the higher professional fees and lower gains on disposals of assets  our operating income and operating margin for fiscal year decreased to million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  for fiscal year net income for fiscal year of million represents a million increase from fiscal year this increase primarily resulted from the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from to primarily due to the reversal of reserves for tax contingencies in fiscal year and foreign exchange gains of million in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange losses of million in fiscal year 
table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross revenue increased to million  an increase of  for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in gross revenue for our helicopter services segment was primarily due to higher third party revenue from rate increases in our north america business unit and a favorable change in the mix of aircraft in our other helicopter services business units as compared to fiscal year gross revenue from our production management services segment increased due to additional activity from a major customer 
our operating expense for fiscal year increased to million  an increase of  from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher labor and maintenance costs in fiscal year and a million curtailment gain reflected in operating expense for fiscal year our operating income and operating margin for fiscal year decreased to million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  in fiscal year however  excluding the curtailment gain of million in fiscal year  our operating income and operating margin for fiscal year increased compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of higher revenue 
net income for fiscal year was million  compared to net income of million in fiscal year excluding the curtailment gain discussed above  our net income for fiscal year increased by million compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of higher revenue and a decrease in other expense 
other expenses decreased due to lower foreign exchange losses in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and the million loss on extinguishment of debt charged to expense during fiscal year internal review in february  we voluntarily advised the staff of the sec that the audit committee of our board of directors had engaged special outside counsel to undertake a review of certain payments made by two of our affiliated entities in a foreign country 
the review of these payments  which initially focused on foreign corrupt practices act matters  was subsequently expanded by such special outside counsel to cover operations in other countries and other issues 
in connection with this review  special outside counsel to the audit committee retained forensic accountants 
as a result of the findings of the internal review  our fiscal year annual report reflected our restated financial statements 
for further information on the restatements  see our fiscal year annual report 
the sec then notified us that it had initiated an informal inquiry and requested that we provide certain documents on a voluntary basis 
the sec thereafter advised us that the inquiry has become a formal investigation 
we have responded to the sec s requests for documents and intend to continue to do so 
the internal review is complete 
all known required restatements were reflected in the financial statements included in our fiscal year annual report  and no further restatements were required in this fiscal year annual report 
as a follow up to matters identified during the course of the internal review  special counsel to the audit committee is completing certain work  and may be called upon to undertake additional work in the future to assist in responding to inquiries from the sec  from other governmental authorities or customers  or as follow up to the previous work performed by such special counsel 
for additional discussion of the sec investigation  the internal review  and related proceedings  see item legal proceedings internal review included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have communicated the audit committee s conclusions with respect to the findings of the internal review to regulatory authorities in some  but not all  of the jurisdictions in which the relevant activities took place 
we are in the process of gathering and analyzing additional information related to these matters  and expect to disclose the audit committee s conclusions to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions once this process has been completed 
such disclosure may result in legal and administrative proceedings  the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us and or current or former employees  officers and or directors who are within the jurisdictions of such authorities  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  including precluding us from participating in business operations in their countries 
to the extent that violations of the law may have occurred in several countries in which we operate  we do not yet know whether such violations can be cured merely by the payment of fines or whether other actions may be taken against us  including requiring us to curtail our business operations in one or more such countries for a period of time 
in the event that we 
table of contents curtail our business operations in any such country  we then may face difficulties exporting our aircraft from such country 
as of march   the book values of our aircraft in nigeria and the south american country where certain improper activities took place were approximately million and million  respectively 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the sec investigation  nor can we predict whether other applicable us and foreign governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations 
the outcome of the sec investigation and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us and or current or former employees  officers and or directors  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  modifications to business practices and compliance programs and or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions 
it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when matters relating to the sec investigation will be completed  the final outcome of the sec investigation  what if any actions may be taken by the sec or by other governmental agencies in the us or in foreign jurisdictions  or the effect that such actions may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in view of the findings of the internal review  we are likely to encounter difficulties in the future conducting business in nigeria and a south american country  and with certain customers 
it is also possible that certain of our existing contracts may be cancelled although none have been cancelled as of the date of filing of this annual report and that we may become subject to claims by third parties  possibly resulting in litigation 
the matters identified in the internal review and their effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to respond to the sec investigation and other governmental authorities and take other actions relating to improper activities that have been identified in connection with the internal review  there can be no assurance that restatements  in addition to those reflected in our fiscal year annual report  will not be required or that our historical financial statements included in this annual report will not change or require further amendment 
in addition  new issues may be identified that may impact our financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in this annual report and lead us to take other remedial actions or otherwise adversely impact us 
during fiscal year  we incurred approximately million in legal and other professional costs in connection with the internal review 
during fiscal year  we incurred an additional million in legal and other professional costs related to the internal review 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the internal review  which will be expensed as incurred and which could be significant in the fiscal quarters in which they are recorded 
as a result of the disclosure and remediation of a number of activities identified in the internal review  we expect to encounter difficulties conducting business in certain foreign countries and retaining and attracting additional business with certain customers 
we cannot predict the extent of these difficulties  however  our ability to continue conducting business in these countries and with these customers and through these agents may be significantly impacted 
we have commenced actions to disclose activities in nigeria identified in the internal review to affected customers  and one or more of these customers may seek to cancel their contracts with us 
one of such customers already has commenced its own investigation 
among other things  we have been advised that such customer intends to exercise its rights to audit a specific contract  as well as to review its other relations with us 
although we have no indication as to what the final outcome of the audit and review will be  it is possible that such customer may seek to cancel one or more existing contracts if it believes that they were improperly obtained or that we breached any of their terms 
since our customers in nigeria are affiliates of major international petroleum companies  with whom we do business throughout the world  any actions which are taken by certain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations  and these customers may preclude us from bidding on future business with them either locally or on a worldwide basis 
in addition  applicable governmental authorities may preclude us from bidding on contracts to provide services in the countries where improper activities took place 
in connection with the internal review  we also have terminated our business relationship with certain agents and have taken actions to terminate business relationships with other agents 
one of the terminated agents and his 
table of contents affiliated entity have commenced litigation against two of our foreign affiliated entities claiming damages of million for breach of contract 
we may be required to indemnify certain of our agents to the extent that regulatory authorities seek to hold them responsible in connection with activities identified in the internal review 
in a south american country where certain improper activities took place  we are negotiating to terminate our ownership interest in the joint venture that provides us with the local ownership content necessary to meet local regulatory requirements for operating in that country 
we may not be successful in our negotiations to terminate our ownership interest in the joint venture  and the outcome of such negotiations may negatively affect our ability to continue leasing our aircraft to the joint venture or other unrelated operating companies  to conduct other business in that country  to export our aircraft from that country  or to recover our investment in the joint venture 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will recover the value of our investment in the joint venture  and therefore we recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal year to reduce the recorded value of our investment in the joint venture 
during fiscal years and  we derived approximately million and million  respectively  of leasing and other revenues from this joint venture  of which million and million  respectively  was paid by us to a third party for the use of the aircraft 
in addition  during fiscal year  approximately million of dividend income was derived from this joint venture 
without a joint venture partner  we will be unable to maintain an operating license and our future activities in that country may be limited to leasing our aircraft to unrelated operating companies 
our joint venture partners and agents are typically influential members of the local business community and instrumental in aiding us in obtaining contracts and managing our affairs in the local country 
as a result of terminating these relationships  our ability to continue conducting business in these countries where the improper activities took place may be negatively affected 
many of the improper actions identified in the internal review resulted in decreasing the costs incurred by us in performing our services 
the remedial actions we are taking will result in an increase in these costs and  if we cannot raise our prices simultaneously and to the same extent as our increased costs  our operating income will decrease 
for additional information regarding the internal review  see item legal proceedings internal review 
document subpoena from us department of justice on june   we issued a press release disclosing that one of our subsidiaries had received a document subpoena from the antitrust division of the doj 
contemporaneously  similar subpoenas were served on two of our former executive officers 
the subpoena relates to a grand jury investigation of potential antitrust violations among providers of helicopter transportation services in the us gulf of mexico 
we are continuing to investigate this matter and are providing the information that the doj has requested from us in the investigation 
the outcome of the doj investigation and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include civil injunctive or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  referral to other governmental agencies and or the payment of damages in civil litigation 
it is not possible to predict accurately at this time when the government investigation described above will be completed 
based on current information  we cannot predict the outcome of such investigation or what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj or other us agencies or authorities or the effect that they may have on us 
to date  we have not identified any material adjustments to our financial statements in connection with the investigation and do not expect  based on information developed to date  that any such adjustment is likely to be required 
we expect to incur costs associated with this investigation  which will be expensed as incurred and which could be significant in the fiscal quarters in which they are recorded 
for additional information regarding the doj investigation  see item legal proceedings document subpoena from us department of justice 

table of contents other matters fiscal year and following in may  we extended our contract with a major customer to march   under which we will provide and operate two large and two medium helicopters 
the contract is not cancelable by the customer during the first months and days cancelation notice is required in the second months 
on december   we sold nine aircraft for million in aggregate to a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation and then leased back each of the nine aircraft under separate operating leases with terms of ten years expiring in january there was a deferred gain on the sale of the aircraft in the amount of approximately million in aggregate  which is being amortized over the lease term 
see liquidity and capital resources financing activities for further information related to this transaction 
in december  we were informed that we were not awarded the contract extension commencing in mid to provide search and rescue services using seven s aircraft and operate four helicopter bases for the uk maritime and coastguard agency mca 
the mca has the option to extend our agreement through july  and we expect that the transition of work will take place  one base at a time  over a period of at least one year 
at the end of the agreement and any transition period  we expect that we will either be able to employ these aircraft for other customers or trade the aircraft in for new aircraft being purchased 
we are currently evaluating our options related to these aircraft 
in fiscal years and  we had million and million  respectively  in operating revenues associated with this contract 
in may  bristow aviation was awarded a three year extension to the integrated aviation consortium iac contract 
this extension began on july  and will continue the utilization of five large aircraft 
as previously discussed  we employ approximately pilots in our north american operations who are represented by the opeiu under a collective bargaining agreement 
we and the pilots represented by the opeiu ratified an amended collective bargaining agreement on april  the terms under the amended agreement are fixed until october  and include a wage increase for the pilot group and improvements to several benefit plans that we do not expect to have a material effect on our future operating expenses 
we are currently involved in negotiations with the unions in nigeria and anticipate that we will increase certain benefits for union personnel as a result of these negotiations 
we do not expect these benefit increases to have a material impact on our results of operations 
prior to fiscal year in january  bristow aviation was awarded two contracts to provide helicopter services in the north sea 
the first is a seven year contract that began on july  and is for a total of two large and four medium aircraft 
the second contract is a five year contract that began on april  and utilizes two large aircraft 
additionally  bristow aviation was awarded the renewal of a contract in nigeria with an international oil company in january for a minimum of five medium aircraft 
the contract term is for five years beginning on april  in november  we sold certain contracts held by one of our technical services subsidiaries to an existing joint venture 
the remaining operations of the subsidiary were downsized by ceasing to perform certain services for third parties that had generated poor financial results during the prior two years 
as a result of the downsizing  we reduced staffing levels by positions in our europe business unit over a nine month period ended on december  approximately million in severance costs and approximately  in other related costs have been incurred as of march  on july   bristow aviation  through certain wholly owned subsidiaries  acquired an interest in an operation in russia in an arm s length transaction with previously unrelated parties 
this transaction included the purchase of a interest in aviashelf  a russian helicopter company that owns five large twin engine helicopters 
simultaneously  through two newly formed owned companies  bristow aviation purchased two large twin engine helicopters and two fixed wing aircraft  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method  and we have consolidated the results of aviashelf from the date of acquisition 
the acquisition was financed with million of existing cash and the assumption of 
table of contents million in debt 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon estimated fair values 
no goodwill was recorded 
the pro forma effect on operations of the acquisition as of the beginning of the periods presented was not material to our consolidated statements of income 
in january  we amended our defined benefit pension plan covering certain united kingdom and other overseas employees 
the amendment  which was effective february   essentially removed the defined benefit feature for a participant s future services and replaced it with a defined contribution arrangement 
under the new defined contribution feature  we contribute a maximum of of a participant s non variable salary to a defined contribution section of the plans 
the participant is required to contribute a minimum of of non variable salary for us to match the contribution 
participants were also given the option to transfer out of the plans 
the net impact on our statement of income as a result of these changes was a reduction in pension expense of approximately million million for our fourth quarter of fiscal year the above change to the plans constitutes a curtailment of benefits and  accordingly  all previously deferred service gains or losses are immediately recognized in the statement of income 
at the date of the amendment  we had a deferred prior service gain of million million  or per diluted share  related to prior plan amendments  which was recognized as a curtailment gain in fiscal year results of operations the following tables set forth certain operating information  which forms the basis for discussion of our helicopter services and production management services segments  and for the seven business units comprising our helicopter services segment 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year information to conform to the current presentation of the helicopter services segment s business units

operating margin is calculated as gross revenues less operating expenses divided by gross revenues 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of the results of operations of our segments and business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under executive overview overview of operating results above 
helicopter services gross revenue for helicopter services increased to million  an increase of  for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  and operating expense increased to million  an increase of  from million for fiscal year this resulted in an operating margin of for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year helicopter services results are further explained below by business unit 
north america gross revenue for north america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year and flight activity increased by 
this increase in gross revenue is due to an increase in the number of aircraft on month to month contracts for fiscal year  as is reflected in the increase in flight activity  the effect in fiscal year of an rate increase for the us gulf of mexico that was phased in beginning in may and  to a lesser extent  an additional rate increase for certain contracts that was effective on march  that will be phased in over the next fiscal year  and an increase in fuel surcharges as fuel prices have increased 
operating expense for north america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance and salary costs due to increased flight activity and higher fuel costs associated with both the increase in flight activity and a higher average cost per gallon 
in addition  direct costs for fiscal year include a million charge related to obsolete inventory 
operating margin for north america increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to the increase in rates discussed above 

table of contents south and central america gross revenue for south and central america decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to a reduction in flight activity in mexico and brazil  offset in part by increased activity in trinidad 
in mexico  flight activity decreased and revenue decreased during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the reduction in flight activity and revenue is due to the conclusion of the contract with pemex in february as a result  our owned unconsolidated affiliates  hemisco and heliservicio  have experienced difficulties in meeting their obligations to make lease rental payments to us and to rlr 
during fiscal year  the company and rlr made a determination that because of the uncertainties as to collectibility  lease revenues from hc would be recognized as they were collected 
for fiscal year  million of amounts billed but not collected from hc have not been recognized in our results  and our share of the equity in earnings of rlr has been reduced by million for amounts billed but not collected from hc 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we recognized revenue of million upon receipt of lease rental payments from hc 
since the conclusion of the petrole s mexicanos pemex contract in february  we have taken several actions to improve the financial condition and profitability of hc  and as discussed further in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  on august   a recapitalization of heliservicio was completed 
we have also reduced the number of aircraft to a lower level based on current utilization  and we are actively seeking other work in mexico  and we are exploring other markets in which to redeploy the aircraft in mexico that are currently operating on an ad hoc basis 
although not anticipated or known at this time  such actions could result in future losses 
brazil s flight activity and revenue decreased and  respectively  due to the conclusion of contracts for two aircraft  one in august and the other in october we are negotiating the termination of our ownership interest in the joint venture that operates in brazil 
nevertheless  upon such termination  we anticipate continuing to lease additional aircraft to helicopter service operators in brazil 
to the extent we are not able to continue such leases  we expect to experience a substantial reduction in business activity in brazil in future periods 
operating expense for south and central america decreased in fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year primarily due to decreased maintenance expense resulting from the decrease in flight activity from fiscal year as a result of the decrease in gross revenue  the operating margin for this business unit decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year europe gross revenue for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the million increase in gross revenue for europe is net of a million decrease relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in gross revenue primarily relates to an increase in flight activity related to the start of one new contract in the north sea  which commenced in april as discussed under other matters above  in december  we were informed that we were not awarded the contract extension commencing in mid to provide search and rescue services using seven s aircraft and operate four helicopter bases for the mca 
the mca has the option to extend our agreement through july  and we expect that the transition of work will take place  one base at a time  over a period of at least one year 
at the end of the agreement and any transition period  we expect that we will either be able to employ these aircraft for other customers or trade the aircraft in for new aircraft being purchased 
operating expense for europe were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the million increase in operating expense for europe is net of a million decrease relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in operating expense primarily relates to an increase in maintenance costs and salaries resulting from the increase in flight activity in our north sea operations  and higher fuel rates 
salaries also increased during fiscal year the operating margin in europe decreased slightly to for fiscal year from for fiscal year 
table of contents west africa gross revenue for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity 
this increase in flight activity primarily related to an increase in drilling activity by two customers in nigeria  which resulted in higher demand for our services 
operating expense for west africa increased in fiscal year to million from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily attributable to increased salary costs  increased aircraft hire costs due to increased activity  and a general increase in local operating costs and overhead 
the operating margin for west africa decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year as a result of the increase in costs 
approximately of our total gross revenue for fiscal year were derived from nigeria 
as a result of the potential cancellation by customers of their contracts with us resulting from the findings of the internal review although none have been cancelled as of the date of filing of this annual report  we may experience a substantial reduction in business activity in nigeria in future periods 
southeast asia gross revenue for southeast asia increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the higher revenue resulted from increased flight activity primarily in australia 
australia s flight activity and revenue increased and  respectively  from fiscal year primarily due to the utilization of an additional large aircraft and more ad hoc flying 
china s flight activity and revenue for fiscal year decreased and  respectively  from fiscal year primarily due to having one less aircraft on contract  which was relocated to malaysia during the year

similar reversals of reserves are expected to occur in the next year  but to a more limited extent

the decrease in net cash provided by operations between fiscal years and was primarily due to cash used to fund working capital requirements in fiscal year resulting from the expansion of our business through purchases of additional aircraft and increases in flight hours from our existing aircraft fleet 
these requirements are likely to continue in the future as we expand our fleet further 
in addition  operating cash flow declined due to a decrease of million in dividends in excess of earnings from unconsolidated affiliates

we guaranteed of the rlr note million and the other shareholder guaranteed the remaining of the rlr note million 
in addition  we have given the bank a put option which the bank may exercise if the aircraft are not returned to the us within days of a default on the rlr note 
any such exercise would require us to purchase the rlr note from the bank 
we simultaneously entered into a similar agreement with the other rlr shareholder which requires that  in event of exercise by the bank of its put option to us  the other shareholder will be required to purchase of the rlr note from us 
as of march   a liability of million representing the fair value of this guarantee was reflected in our balance sheet in other liabilities and deferred credits 
we used the proceeds received from the sale of the aircraft to rlr to repay the million short term note to the aircraft manufacturer in july no gain or loss was recognized on the sale 
as of june   we were in default of various financial information reporting covenants under the rlr note for not providing financial information for fiscal year when due  and also for not providing similar information to other creditors

uk facilities as of march   bristow aviation had a million million facility for letters of credit  of which million million was outstanding  and a million million net overdraft facility  under which no borrowings were outstanding 
both facilities are with a uk bank 
the letter of credit facility is provided on an uncommitted basis  and outstanding letters of credit bear a rate of per annum 
borrowings under the net overdraft facility are payable on demand and bear interest at the bank s base rate plus a spread that can vary between and per annum depending on the net overdraft amount 
the net overdraft facility was scheduled to expire on august   but has been extended to august  the facilities are guaranteed by certain of bristow aviation s subsidiaries and secured by several helicopter mortgages and a negative pledge of bristow aviation s assets 
revolving credit facility as of march   we had a million revolving credit facility with a us bank that expires on august  this credit facility is subject to a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to one month libor plus a spread ranging from to 
the rate of the spread depends on a financial covenant ratio under the credit facility 
borrowings under this credit facility are unsecured and are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
we had no amounts drawn under this facility as of march   but did have million of letters of credit utilized which reduced availability under the facility 
we were in default of various financial information reporting covenants for not providing financial information for fiscal year when due  and also for not providing similar information to other creditors 
the bank provided a waiver through january  upon payment of a fee of  in january  the default was cured 
as of march   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under this credit facility new credit facilities we are in the process of arranging new bank credit facilities with a group of lenders to replace the million revolving credit facility described above 
the financing has not gone to the syndication market yet  but we have selected an agent bank to lead the syndication process and executed a commitment letter and term sheet 
we intend to seek a million revolving credit facility to be used primarily for borrowings and  as needed  letters of credit  and a separate letter of credit facility in the amount of million together  the facilities

table of contents grid based on our senior unsecured public debt ratings 
the financing is expected to close in june after the filing of this annual report 
however  definitive agreements for this financing have not been executed  and we may not be able to complete this financing 
capital commitments as shown in the table below  we expect to make additional capital expenditures over the next seven fiscal years to replace certain of our aircraft and to upgrade strategic base facilities 
as of march   we had million remaining to be paid under several aircraft purchase agreements 
to the extent they occur  any sales and trade ins of older aircraft will reduce these projected expenditures 
we plan to use internally generated funds and alternative financing sources  if needed  to meet our obligations under these agreements 
on may   we entered into an agreement to purchase two large aircraft for approximately million  deliverable in early calendar year the agreement provides us with the option to purchase up to thirteen additional large aircraft 
of these options  five relate to aircraft deliverable in the second fiscal quarter of  and the remaining eight relate to aircraft deliverable in calendar year we have also made an arrangement with the manufacturer pursuant to which we may delay our existing purchase commitments for up to million of medium aircraft upon the exercise of the first option

other obligations pension plan as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability and a million prepaid pension asset related to the bristow helicopter group limited bristow helicopters  a wholly owned subsidiary of bristow aviation pension plan 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the asset represents the cumulative contributions made by bristow helicopters in excess of accrued net periodic pension cost 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by uk legislation within three years and funded within ten years 
in recognition of participants concerns regarding the under funded position of the plan as well as other changes we made to the plan as more fully described under executive overview other matters prior to fiscal year  on february   we contributed million million to the plan to reach the funded level  and agreed to monthly contributions of million million for the next ten years to comply with the funding requirement 
the million million contribution was made from existing cash balances and did not materially impact our working capital position 
in order to meet these funding requirements  we agreed  subject to our review every three years  to make contributions totaling million million per year for the next years beginning may and million million per year for the 
table of contents following years 
nevertheless  regulatory agencies in the uk may require us to further increase the monthly contributions 
in may  the pensions regulator tpr in the uk published a statement on regulating the funding of defined benefit schemes 
in this statement  tpr focused on a number of items including the use of triggers to determine the level of funding of the schemes 
based on this statement  it is possible that we will see an increase in the required level of our contributions in future periods 
we are not currently able to estimate what this increased level of funding will be and what impact it will have on our financial position in future periods 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments  interest payments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the table below 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of march  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings

these amounts are undiscounted and are based on the expectation that the pension will be fully funded in approximately years 
as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability and a million prepaid pension asset associated with this obligation 
since march   we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations of million for two additional aircraft not reflected in the table above  all of which is expected to be paid in fiscal year other purchase obligations primarily represent unfilled purchase orders for aircraft parts 
we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs and million of the debt of rlr  both unconsolidated affiliates 
relates to an indemnity agreement between us and afianzadora sofimex  sa to support issuance of surety bonds on behalf of hc from time to time

in january  a letter of credit was issued against the revolving credit facility for million in conjunction with the additional collateral for the sale and leaseback financing discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the letter of credit expires january  management does not expect these guarantees to become obligations that we will have to fund 
financial condition and sources of liquidity our future cash requirements include the contractual obligations discussed in the previous section and our normal operations 
normally our operating cash flows are sufficient to fund our cash needs 
however  as previously discussed under cash flows from operating activities  the expansion of our business through purchases of additional aircraft and increases in flight hours from our existing aircraft fleet in fiscal year  required and is likely to require in the future additional cash to fund the resulting increase in working capital requirements 
in addition  should we exercise our options to acquire aircraft in addition to those for which we have existing purchase commitments or should we elect to expand our business through acquisition  including acquisitions under consideration or negotiation  we would require additional cash 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that our existing cash  future cash flows from operations and the new credit facility we are seeking to establish will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future based on existing commitments 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to finance existing aircraft purchase commitments  and we likely will need to do so to fund any additional aircraft purchases or business acquisitions  including acquisitions under consideration or negotiation

working capital as of march   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital in fiscal year was primarily a result of an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in current deferred taxes  which was offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt and the decrease in cash and cash equivalents

exposure to currency fluctuations see our discussion of the impact of market risk  including our exposure to currency fluctuations  on our financial position and results of operations discussed under item a below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by 
table of contents generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oilfield service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market condition in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
our annual tax provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal years  and  we had net reversals of reserves for estimated tax exposures of million  million and million  respectively 
these reversals were made in the periods in which the statute of limitations for the related exposures expired 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for 
table of contents the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  primarily us foreign tax credit carry forwards was million 
we decreased the valuation allowance as of march  to million 
if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are permanently reinvested of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  signed into law october   provides for a special one time tax deduction equal to of dividends received out of qualifying earnings that are paid in either a company s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date 
the special deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements  one of which is to adopt a domestic reinvestment plan drip to document planned reinvestments of amounts equal to the foreign earnings repatriated under the jobs act 
in accordance with a drip approved by our board of directors  during fiscal year  we distributed million of earnings from foreign subsidiaries that were previously considered permanently invested 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as 
table of contents such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenue when it is both realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when the following conditions exist the persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally a customer contract  the services or products have been performed or delivered to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable within the contract  and collection is probable 
more specifically  revenue from helicopter services is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
the charges under these contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
these contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the contract before the end of the term 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than other helicopter contracts 
in order to offset potential increases in operating costs  our long term contracts may provide for periodic increases in the contractual rates charged for our services 
we recognize the impact of these rate increases when the criteria outlined above have been met 
this generally includes written recognition from our customers that they are in agreement with the amount of the rate escalation 
in addition  our standard rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally reimbursed by the customer 
revenue from production management is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
contracts are generally evergreen with a yearly review 
each party has a thirty day cancellation clause 
the rates charged to the customer are either monthly  based on services specified in the contract  or hourly if outside the scope of the contract 
typically hourly rates are charged for services provided beyond the basic level contemplated in the contract 
services provided include personnel and transportation 
any escalation in rates is agreed to in writing by the customer 
with respect to both our helicopter services and production management services segments  cost reimbursements from customers are recorded as revenue 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on 
table of contents historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these reserves  we consider our historical experience  changes in our customer s financial position  restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with customers regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
during fiscal years  and  we increased the allowance account through charges to expense of million  million and million  respectively  and decreased the allowance for write offs and recoveries of specifically identified uncollectible accounts by million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal year  we reduced revenue for a reserve of million against invoices billed to our unconsolidated affiliate in mexico  which have not been recognized in our results 
see discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
inventory reserve we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
during fiscal years and  we increased the valuation reserve through charges to expenses of million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
during fiscal years and  we decreased the valuation reserve for write offs of identified obsolete and excess inventory by million and million  respectively 
insurance we are self insured for our group medical insurance plans in the us in addition  we have several medical plans covering certain non us employee groups 
we must make estimates to record the expenses related to these plans 
we also have workers compensation programs in the us for work related injuries 
in addition  we have insurance for work related injuries covering certain non us employee groups 
we estimate the expenses related to the retained portion of that risk 
if actual experience under any of our insurance plans is greater than our original estimates  we may have to record charges to income when we identify the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if actual costs are lower than our estimates or return premiums are larger than originally projected  we may have to record credits to income 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent 
table of contents liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected flight hours and rates 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  we also test for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  this statement amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the similar productive assets concept and replace it with the concept of commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange shall be measured based on the fair value of the exchanged assets unless the exchange lacks commercial substance 
commercial substance occurs when the future cash flows of an entity are changed significantly due to the nonmonetary exchange 
the adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal year did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r becomes effective for our fiscal year beginning april  and will require us to expense stock options and other share based payments 
we adopted sfas no 
r on april  using the modified prospective application as prescribed under sfas no 
r  and its impact will be reflected in our fiscal year results 
based on our unvested stock option grants as of march   we estimate that the adoption of this statement in fiscal year will reduce net income for fiscal year by approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
this effect is consistent with our pro forma disclosure included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  except that estimated forfeitures will be considered in the calculation of compensation expense under sfas no 
r 
additionally  the actual effect on net income and earnings per share will vary depending upon the number of options granted and restricted stock units awarded in subsequent periods compared to prior years 
we estimate that expense recorded related to restricted stock units  which was already included in compensation expense prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  will further reduce net income for fiscal year by approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such tax benefits were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of to address the treatment of a special one time incentive provided in the jobs act for companies to repatriate foreign earnings 
signed into law on october   the jobs act provides for a special one time tax deduction equal to 
table of contents of dividends received out of qualifying foreign earnings that are paid in either a company s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the enactment date 
the special deduction is subject to a number of limitations and requirements  one of which is to adopt a drip to document planned reinvestments of amounts equal to the foreign earnings repatriated under the jobs act 
in september  we approved a drip that provides for the repatriation of up to million of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the jobs act 
the favorable us tax rate on such repatriations under the jobs act applied to million of qualifying distributions received by us through march  we have reflected the million of us tax liability associated with the total repatriated earnings in our provision for income taxes for fiscal year in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of sfas no

we have evaluated our leased and owned properties for potential asset retirement obligations under sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted by fin no 
based on this review  we identified obligations primarily related to the removal of fuel storage tanks upon the abandonment or disposal of facilities 
the operation of fuel storage tanks is monitored on an ongoing basis to prevent ground contamination and the cost of removing such tanks is not significant 
based on our evaluation of such obligations  such liabilities were deemed to be immaterial to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
becomes effective for our fiscal year and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
establishes the method of retrospective application as the required method of reporting a change in accounting principle  unless impracticable  or unless the new accounting principle explicitly states transition requirements and we expect that in the future there will be more instances of retrospective application of new accounting principles to prior periods whereas previously such applications were typically required to be reported as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the accounting principle was adopted 
with respect to reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements  sfas no 
carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
which requires the correction to be reflected as a prior period adjustment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  and interest rates as discussed below 
foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are in british pounds sterling 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 
because we maintain our financial statements in us dollars  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar and between other foreign currencies and the us dollar 
in preparing our financial statements  we must convert all non us dollar currencies to non us dollars 
the effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in a component of stockholders investment and foreign currency 
table of contents transaction gains or losses and translation of currency amounts not deemed permanently reinvested are credited or charged to income and reflected in other income expense 
in the past three fiscal years our stockholders investment has increased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
the british pound sterling is the currency in which most of bristow aviation s revenue and expenses are paid 
approximately of our operating revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pounds sterling into us dollars 
in addition  we receive other revenue that is not in us dollars or british pounds sterling  such as australian dollars  euros  nigerian naira  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
we can reduce or eliminate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we also have expenses that are payable in the same foreign currency as our revenue 
our principal exposure is to changes in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
during fiscal year  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us  with an average of one british pound us for the fiscal year 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us 
during fiscal year  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us  with an average of one british pound us for the fiscal year 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us 
during fiscal year  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us  with an average of one british pound us for the fiscal year 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us 
we occasionally use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  we will use forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
we have historically used these instruments primarily in the buying and selling of spare parts  maintenance services and equipment 
as of march   we did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of all our foreign currencies relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk the market for our services and products is primarily the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated international oil companies and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments in minimal 
interest rate risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  none of which carries a variable rate of interest 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions 
the estimated fair value of our total debt as of march  and was million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices for the publicly listed senior notes 
if prevailing market interest rates had been higher as of march   and all other factors effecting our debt remained the same  the fair value of our senior notes due would have decreased by million or 
under comparable sensitivity analysis as of march   the fair value of the senior notes due would have decreased by million or 
borrowings under our million revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to one month libor plus a spread ranging from to 
during fiscal year  there were no amounts drawn under this facility
