overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of rapid  accurate and cost effective nucleic acid probe based products used for the clinical diagnosis of human diseases and for screening of donated human blood 
we also develop and manufacture nucleic acid probe based products for the detection of harmful organisms in the environment and in industrial processes 
we have over years of nucleic acid detection research and product development experience  and our products  which are based on our patented nucleic acid testing  or nat  technology  are used daily in clinical laboratories and blood collection centers in countries throughout the world 
we have achieved strong growth in both revenues and earnings due principally to the success of our blood screening products which are used to detect the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and hepatitis c virus  or hcv  and hepatitis b virus  or hbv 
under our collaboration agreement with chiron corporation  or chiron  we are responsible for the research  development  regulatory process and manufacturing of our blood screening products  while chiron is responsible for marketing  sales  distribution and service of those products 
since  we have also experienced strong growth in clinical diagnostics for sexually transmitted diseases  or stds  due to the success of aptima combo recent events financial results product sales for were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
product sales in included approximately million due to the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to us blood screening products shipped to chiron s recently established third party warehouse  whereas in the past  we held such inventory in the virtual warehouse and deferred revenue recognition until products were shipped to chiron s end customers 
total revenues for were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
net income for the year was million per diluted share  compared to million per diluted share in  an increase of 
the prior year total revenue and net income included a contract milestone of million from chiron and a license fee of million earned in connection with our cross licensing agreement with tosoh corporation  or tosoh 
these amounts added approximately million to revenues and to diluted earnings per share 
corporate collaborations in october  we entered into a non exclusive collaboration with molecular profiling institute  inc  a private company  to accelerate market development for our pipeline of cancer diagnostics 
under the terms of 
table of contents the agreement  molecular profiling has agreed to validate  commercialize and undertake market development activities for up to four of our products  starting with our investigational pca assay  which is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of prostate cancer 
in addition  in october  we purchased from molecular profiling an aggregate of  shares of series b preferred stock at a purchase price per share of 
we have recorded this million investment on a cost basis  and will review the asset for impairment on an ongoing basis 
in august  we entered into a collaboration agreement with millipore corporation  or millipore  to develop  manufacture and commercialize nat products for rapid microbiological and viral monitoring for millipore s exclusive use or sale in process monitoring in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be primarily responsible for assay development and manufacturing  while millipore will manage worldwide commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration 
in july  we entered into a collaboration agreement with ge infrastructure water and process technologies  or gei  a unit of general electric company  to develop  manufacture and commercialize nat products designed to detect the unique genetic sequences of microorganisms for gei s exclusive use or sale in selected water testing applications 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be primarily responsible for assay development and manufacturing  while gei will manage worldwide commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration 
in june  we entered into a research agreement with smithkline beecham corporation  doing business as glaxosmithkline  and smithkline beecham cork ltd  together referred to as gsk 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to provide our investigational pca assay to test up to  clinical samples obtained from patients enrolled in gsk s reduce tm reduction by dutasteride of prostate cancer events clinical trial  which is designed to determine the efficacy and safety of gsk s drug dutasteride avodart in reducing the risk of prostate cancer in men at increased risk of this disease 
collection of urine samples from selected study sites will commence pending approvals by regulatory authorities and appropriate study sites ethics committees 
we agreed to reimburse gsk for expenses that gsk incurs for sample collection and related processes during the four year prospective clinical trial 
we also agreed to provide the pca assay without charge and to pay third party clinical laboratory expenses for using the assay to test the samples 
licensing in january and december  biom rieux s affiliates exercised options to develop diagnostic products for certain selected undisclosed disease targets using our patented ribosomal rna technologies pursuant to the terms of a september agreement 
in exchange for these rights  biom rieux s affiliates paid us million in license fees  and million as an option fee 
we recorded million of these fees as license revenue in  based on the number of targets selected and the total number of targets that may be selected by the end of the amount and timing of additional revenue that we record will depend on the number of additional targets  if any  selected by biom rieux s affiliates  which have options to develop diagnostic products for other disease targets that they may select by paying us up to an additional million by the end of we will receive royalties on the sale of any products developed by biom rieux s affiliates using our intellectual property 
in january  we entered into a license agreement with corixa corporation  or corixa  and received the right to develop molecular diagnostic tests for multiple potential genetic markers in the areas of prostate  ovarian  cervical  kidney  lung and colon cancers 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we paid corixa an initial access fee of million  an additional million in february and have agreed to pay an additional million on january   unless we terminate the agreement prior to that date 
we have recorded the collective million of license fees as an intangible asset which is being amortized on a straight line basis to research and development expense over the underlying life of the patents 
we also agreed to pay corixa milestone payments totaling an additional million on a product by product basis based on 
table of contents the occurrence of certain regulatory and or commercial events 
we agreed to pay corixa additional milestone payments and royalties on net sales of any products developed by us using corixa s technology 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with adnagen ag  or adnagen  to license from adnagen cell capture technology for use in our molecular diagnostic tests to detect prostate and other cancers 
under the terms of the agreement  we recorded license fees of million million in and million in  which have been recorded as research and development  or r d  expenses  since we have not yet determined technological feasibility and do not currently have alternative future plans to use this technology other than for our prostate cancer development program 
upon the occurrence of certain clinical  regulatory and or commercial events  we agreed to pay adnagen up to three milestone payments totaling an additional million 
further  we agreed to pay adnagen royalties on net sales of any products we develop using adnagen s technology 
in november  we entered into an agreement with qualigen  inc under which we have an exclusive option to develop and commercialize a nat instrument designed for use at the point of sample collection based on qualigen s fda approved fastpack immunoassay system 
if successfully developed  the portable instrument would use our nat technology to detect  at the point of sample collection  the presence of harmful microorganisms  genetic mutations and other markers of diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid qualigen million for an month option to license  on an exclusive worldwide basis  qualigen s technology to develop nat assays for the clinical diagnostics  blood screening and industrial fields 
during this period  we are evaluating the feasibility of adapting qualigen s immunoassay platform to perform nat using our proprietary technologies 
if we exercise this option  we will purchase shares of qualigen preferred stock convertible into approximately of qualigen s then outstanding fully diluted common shares 
the cost of acquiring this equity interest would be approximately million 
in addition  we may pay qualigen up to million in license fees based on development milestones  as well as royalties on any eventual product sales 
we recorded the million option fee as an intangible asset which is being amortized over the month evaluation period of the option or until execution of the license  whichever comes first 
in september  we entered into a settlement agreement and an amendment to our non exclusive license agreement with vysis  inc  or vysis  under which we withdrew our patent litigation against vysis and agreed to pay vysis which was acquired by abbott an aggregate of million 
this amount included million for a fully paid up license to eliminate all of our future royalty obligations to vysis under the collins patent covered by the license  and million for a fully paid up  royalty free license in additional fields under the collins patent 
we had been paying royalties under a pre existing license agreement which has since been amended 
the license now covers current and future products in the field of infectious diseases  as well as potential products in all other fields 
chiron reimbursed us million of the million allocated to the cost of the fully paid up license for the current field  commensurate with its obligation to reimburse us for a portion of the royalties due on the sale of blood screening products 
we recorded the million net payment million less chiron s million reimbursement to vysis as an intangible asset  which is being amortized to cost of goods sold over the patent s remaining economic life of months 
supply agreements in february  we entered into a supply and purchase agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
and its affiliate roche molecular systems  inc  or roche 
under this agreement  roche agreed to manufacture and supply to us dna oligonucleotides for human papillomavirus  or hpv 
we plan to use these oligonucleotides in molecular diagnostic assays 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid roche manufacturing access fees of million in may and agreed to pay million within days of the occurrence of certain future commercial events  but not later than december  we also agreed to pay roche transfer fees for the hpv oligonucleotides 
the initial million manufacturing fee has been recorded as an intangible asset which  upon commercialization of the our hpv products  is expected to be amortized to cost of product sales over the economic life of the products 

table of contents product development on december   the fda granted marketing approval for our west nile virus  or wnv  assay on the enhanced semi automated system  or esas  to screen donated human blood 
the k clearance of esas for use with the wnv assay was granted prior to the assay s approval 
we intend to submit for k clearance of the tigris instrument for use with the wnv assay in the first part of we plan to submit a post approval supplement to our wnv biologics license application  or bla  adding the tigris instrument  at approximately the same time 
in october  the fda notified us that it considers our tigris instrument for blood screening not substantially equivalent to our already cleared esas for screening donated human blood with the procleix ultrio assay 
the fda made this determination in response to our k application for the tigris instrument for blood screening 
also in october  we received a complete review letter from the fda setting forth questions regarding our bla for the procleix ultrio assay itself 
we anticipate submitting a bla amendment for the procleix ultrio assay for use on esas  responding to the fda s questions  by the end of the first quarter of we anticipate submitting a new k application for the tigris instrument for use with the procleix ultrio assay following clearance of the tigris instrument for use with the wnv assay 
we anticipate submitting a post approval bla supplement for the procleix ultrio assay  for use on the tigris instrument  following approval of the bla for the procleix ultrio assay on esas 
there can be no assurance that the procleix ultrio assay will receive regulatory approval by the fda or that the tigris instrument will receive fda clearance for use with the wnv or procleix ultrio assays 
in august  the fda granted marketing clearance to use the aptima combo assay to test for chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae from liquid pap specimens collected and processed with cytyc corporation s thinprep system 
this new use provides physicians the convenience of intercepting chlamydia infections and gonorrhea from the same sample collected for the thinprep pap test 
the pap test remains the most widely used screening test in the united states for the early detection of cervical cancer 
we anticipate filing for regulatory clearance in the united states of a similar application from tripath s liquid pap transport media in arbitration award in april  we received a tentative opinion and award in our arbitration with bayer healthcare  llc concerning the parties collaboration for the development and sale of nucleic acid diagnostic tests for viral organisms 
in june  the arbitrator issued an interim opinion and award that adopted all substantive rulings of the tentative opinion and award 
the arbitrator determined that we are entitled to a co exclusive right to distribute qualitative transcription mediated amplification  or tma  assays to detect hcv and hiv for the remaining term of the agreement 
bayer previously held the exclusive rights to market these products 
the arbitrator also determined that the collaboration agreement should be prospectively terminated  as we requested 
as a result of a termination of the agreement  we will have the right to develop and market future viral assays that had been previously reserved for bayer 
bayer will retain co exclusive rights to distribute two products that it currently markets 
further  the arbitrator determined that bayer will be required to reimburse us million for our legal fees and expenses related to the arbitration proceedings 
in the june interim opinion and award  the arbitrator also concluded that an additional hearing would be required to determine whether a royalty payment would be required as a result of our exercise of our co exclusive rights to distribute the qualitative tma assays for hcv and hiv  and  if so  the amount and beneficiary of such royalties 
the additional hearing took place in september on march   the arbitrator issued his tentative award following the additional hearing 
the arbitrator concluded that gen probe is licensed under the relevant hiv and hcv patents for qualitative assays during the term of the collaboration agreement and that the company is not obligated to pay bayer an initial license fee in connection with the sale of those assays 
the arbitrator further concluded that the company will be required to pay running sales royalties to bayer on the company s sales of the qualitative tma assays for hcv and hiv we believe the royalty rates are generally consistent with rates paid by other licensees of the relevant patents 
the march  tentative award is subject to revision by the arbitrator following comments by the parties 
the arbitrator s final decision in this matter is subject to a right to appeal to an arbitration appeal panel within the judicial 
table of contents arbitration mediation services  inc  or jams 
there can be no assurances as to the final outcome of the arbitration 
revenues we derive revenues from three primary sources product sales  collaborative research revenue and royalty and license revenue 
the majority of our revenues come from product sales  which consist primarily of sales of our nat assays tested on our proprietary instruments that serve as the analytical platform for our assays 
we recognize as collaborative research revenue payments we receive from chiron for the products provided under our collaboration agreements with chiron prior to regulatory approval  and the payments we receive from chiron  bayer corporation  or bayer  and other collaboration partners for research and development activities 
our royalty and license revenues reflect fees paid to us by third parties for the use of our proprietary technology 
in  product sales  collaborative research revenues and royalty and license revenues equaled  and  respectively  of our total revenues of million 
product sales our primary source of revenue is the sale of clinical diagnostic and blood screening products in the united states 
our clinical diagnostic products include our aptima combo  pace  accuprobe and amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test product lines 
during  we shipped approximately million tests for the diagnosis of a wide variety of infectious microorganisms  including those causing stds  tuberculosis  strep throat  pneumonia and fungal infections 
the principal customers for our clinical diagnostics products include large reference laboratories  public health laboratories and hospitals located in north america  europe and japan 
since  we have supplied nat assays for use in screening blood donations intended for transfusion 
our primary blood screening assay detects hiv and hcv in donated human blood 
our blood screening assays and instruments are marketed through our collaboration with chiron under the procleix and ultrio trademarks 
we recognize product sales from the manufacture and shipment of tests for screening donated blood at the contractual transfer prices specified in our collaboration agreement with chiron for sales to blood bank facilities located in countries where our products have obtained governmental approvals 
blood screening product sales are then adjusted monthly corresponding to chiron s payment to us of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net revenue from sales by chiron to the end user  less the transfer price revenues previously recorded 
net sales are ultimately equal to the sales of the assays by chiron to third parties  less freight  duty and certain other adjustments specified in our agreement with chiron  multiplied by our share of the net revenue 
our share of the net revenue was with respect to sales of assays that include a test for hcv beginning the second quarter of following fda approval in february upon implementation of commercial pricing  through april   after which our share of net revenues from sales of assays that include a test for hcv was adjusted to 
effective january   our share of net revenues from commercial sales of assays that include a test for hcv was permanently changed to under our agreement with chiron 
with respect to commercial sales of blood screening assays under our collaboration with chiron that do not include a test for hcv  such as possible future commercial tests for wnv  we will receive of net revenues after deduction of appropriate expenses 
our costs related to these products primarily include manufacturing costs 
collaborative research revenue we have recorded revenues related to use of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval as collaborative research revenue because of price restrictions applied to these products prior to fda license approval in the united states and similar approvals in foreign countries 
in and  we recognized million and million  respectively  as collaborative research revenue through our collaboration with chiron from deliveries of wnv tests on a cost recovery basis 
in and  we recognized million and million respectively  in reimbursements for expenses incurred for wnv development research as collaborative research revenue 
we expect to discontinue recognizing these sales as collaborative research revenue upon first shipment of the fda 
table of contents approved and labeled product 
in december  the fda granted marketing approval for our wnv assay on esas to screen donated human blood 
the k clearance of esas for use with the wnv assay was granted prior to the assay s approval 
we intend to submit for k clearance of the tigris instrument for use with the wnv assay in the first part of we plan to submit a post approval supplement to our wnv assay bla  adding the tigris instrument  at approximately the same time 
in march  we signed a definitive agreement with chiron for the development and commercialization of the procleix ultrio assay 
in each of and  we recognized million in reimbursements for expenses incurred related to the development of this assay 
we expect to receive further reimbursement from chiron for certain costs incurred during the development of the procleix ultrio and wnv assays 
in january  we commenced clinical trials of the procleix ultrio assay in the united states on our tigris instrument 
in september  we filed a bla with the fda for this assay 
in october  we received a complete review letter from the fda setting forth additional questions regarding our bla for the procleix ultrio assay 
we anticipate submitting a bla amendment for the procleix ultrio assay for use on esas  responding to fda s questions  by the end of the first quarter of we anticipate submitting a new k application for the tigris instrument for use with the procleix ultrio assay following clearance of the tigris instrument for use with the wnv assay 
we anticipate submitting a post approval bla supplement for the procleix ultrio assay  for use on the tigris instrument  following approval of the bla for the procleix ultrio assay on esas 
there can be no assurance that the procleix ultrio assay will receive regulatory approval by the fda or that the tigris instrument will receive fda clearance for use with the wnv or procleix ultrio assays 
we recognize collaborative research revenue over the term of certain strategic alliance agreements with chiron and others as reimbursable costs are incurred 
the costs associated with the reported collaborative research revenue are based on fully burdened full time equivalent  or fte  rates and are reflected in our statements of income under the captions research and development  marketing and sales and general and administrative  based on the nature of the costs 
we do not separately track all of the costs applicable to our blood screening development collaboration with chiron and  therefore  are not able to quantify all of the direct costs associated with collaborative research revenue 
royalty and license revenue we recognize non refundable up front license fees over the performance period of an agreement or at the time that we have satisfied all substantive performance obligations of an agreement 
we also receive milestone payments for successful achievement of contractual development activities 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones when i we have earned the milestone payment  ii the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  iii the fees are non refundable  and iv our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
under the strategic alliance agreement we entered into with chiron in june  we have responsibility for research  development and manufacturing of the blood screening products covered by the agreement  while chiron has responsibility for marketing  distribution and service of the blood screening products worldwide 
during  we recognized as royalty and license revenue  a million milestone payment from chiron as we commenced clinical trials of the procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  an additional payment of million is due to us in the future if we obtain fda approval of our procleix ultrio assay for use on the tigris instrument 
there is no guarantee we will achieve this milestone and receive any additional milestone payments under this agreement 
in october  the fda notified us that it considers our tigris instrument for blood screening not substantially equivalent to our already cleared esas for screening donated human blood with the procleix ultrio assay 
also in october  we received a complete review letter from the fda setting forth additional questions regarding our bla for the procleix ultrio assay itself 
there can be no assurance that these products will receive regulatory clearance by the fda 

table of contents cost of product sales cost of product sales includes direct material  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead associated with the production of inventory on a standard cost basis 
other components of cost of product sales include royalties  warranty costs  instrument and software amortization and allowances for scrap 
in addition  we manufacture significant quantities of raw materials  development lots  and clinical trial lots of product prior to receiving fda approval for commercial sale 
during and  our manufacturing facilities produced development lots for wnv and procleix ultrio assays 
the majority of costs associated with these development lots are classified as research and development expense 
the portion of a development lot that is manufactured for commercial sale outside the united states is capitalized to inventory and classified as cost of product sales upon shipment 
our blood screening manufacturing facility has and will continue to operate below its potential capacity for the foreseeable future 
a portion of this available capacity is utilized for research and development activities as new product offerings are developed for commercialization 
as a result  certain operating costs of our blood screening facility  together with other manufacturing costs for the production of pre commercial development lot assays that are delivered under the terms of an investigational new drug  or ind  application are classified as research and development expense prior to fda approval 
in  the growth in blood screening revenues was partially driven by sales of tigris instruments to chiron totaling approximately million 
under our contract with chiron  we sell tigris instruments to them at prices that approximate cost 
these instrument sales  therefore  negatively impact our gross margin percentage in the periods when they occur  but are a necessary precursor to higher sales of blood screening assays in the future 
research and development we invest significantly in r d as part of our ongoing efforts to develop new products and technologies 
our r d expenses include the development of proprietary products and instrument platforms  as well as expenses related to the co development of new products and technologies in collaboration with our strategic partners 
r d spending is expected to increase in the future due to new product development  clinical trial costs and clinical manufacturing costs  however  we expect our r d expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decline in future years 
the timing of clinical trials and development manufacturing costs is variable and is affected by product development activities and the regulatory process 
in connection with our r d efforts  we have various license agreements that provide us with rights to develop and market products using certain technologies and patent rights maintained by third parties 
these agreements generally provide for a term that commences upon execution of the agreement and continues until expiration of the last patent related to the technologies covered by the license 
r d expenses include the costs of raw materials  development lots and clinical trial lots of products that we manufacture 
these costs are dependent on the status of projects under development and may vary substantially between quarterly or annual reporting periods 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the manufacture of developmental lots and clinical trial lots for our blood screening products and with further development of our tigris instrument 
collaborative research revenues associated with these types of costs have at times been realized in a period later than when the costs were incurred due to the need for clarification on the extent of reimbursable costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of invento 
table of contents ries  long lived assets including patent costs and capitalized software  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record shipments of our clinical diagnostic products as product sales when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from our blood screening products shipped to countries where regulatory approval has been received is recorded as product sales based on a contracted transfer price with our third party collaboration partner  chiron 
based on the terms of our agreement with chiron  our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user is not known until reported to us by chiron 
we manufacture our blood screening products according to chiron s demand specifications and transfer completed product to chiron s virtual warehouse  which is located on our premises 
upon transfer to chiron s virtual warehouse  we bill chiron at an agreed upon transfer price  and chiron remits payment within days 
in the past  we recorded all amounts billed as deferred revenue until shipment from the virtual warehouse to chiron s end customers or chiron s international warehouse  upon which we then recognized blood screening product sales at the transfer price and recorded the related cost of products sold 
we then adjusted blood screening product sales upon our receipt of customer revenue reports and a net payment from chiron of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net sales by chiron of these products  less the transfer price revenues previously paid 
during  our us blood screening sales increased by approximately million due to the recognition of previously deferred revenue resulting from our shipment of chiron controlled blood screening products from chiron s virtual warehouse to their recently established third party warehouse  rather than directly to their end customers 
product sales also include the sales or rental value associated with the delivery of our proprietary integrated instrument platforms that perform our diagnostic assays 
generally  we provide our instrumentation to clinical laboratories and hospitals without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into an equipment lease 
instead  we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation in the amounts we charge for our diagnostic assays 
we have also implemented multi year sales contracts that have an equipment factor set forth in them 
the costs associated with an instrument are charged to cost of product sales on a straight line basis over the estimated life of an instrument  which ranges from three to five years  generally  three years for luminometers and dts instruments  and five years for the tigris instrument and dts instruments 
the costs to maintain these instruments in the field are charged to cost of product sales as incurred 
we sell instruments to chiron for use in blood screening and record these instrument sales upon delivery since chiron is responsible for the placement  maintenance and repair of the units with their customers 
we also sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers 
we record sales of these instruments as product sales upon delivery and receipt of customer acceptance 
prior to delivery  each instrument is tested to meet company and fda specifications  and is shipped fully assembled 
customer acceptance of our instrument systems requires installation and training by our technical service personnel 
generally  installation is a standard process consisting principally of uncrating  calibrating  and testing the instrumentation 
we record as collaborative research revenue shipments of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval 
we do this because price restrictions apply to these products prior to fda marketing approval in the united states and 
table of contents similar approvals in foreign countries 
upon first shipment of fda approved and labeled product following commercial approval  we classify sales of these products as product sales in our financial statements 
we recognize collaborative research revenue over the term of various collaboration agreements  as negotiated monthly contracted amounts are earned or reimbursable costs are incurred related to those agreements 
negotiated monthly contracted amounts are earned in relative proportion to the performance required under the contracts 
non refundable license fees are recognized over the related performance period or at the time that we have satisfied all performance obligations related to the agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones when i we have earned the milestone payment  ii the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  iii the fees are non refundable  and iv our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we recognize royalty revenue related to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technologies under license agreements with third parties 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
for those arrangements where royalties are not reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from the applicable licensee 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit losses historically have been minimal and within management s expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we record valuation adjustments to our inventory balances for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of such inventory and its usage based upon assumptions about future product demand and the shelf life and expiration dates for finished goods and materials used in the manufacturing process 
we operate in an environment that is regulated by the fda and other governmental agencies that may place restrictions on our ability to sell our products into the marketplace if certain compliance requirements are not met 
we have made assumptions that are reflected in arriving at our net inventory value based on information currently available to us 
if future product demand  regulatory constraints or other market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we also manufacture products to conduct developmental evaluations and clinical trials  and to validate our manufacturing practices prior to receiving regulatory clearance for commercial sale of our products 
in these circumstances  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to sell these products until the fda or other governing bodies commercially approve them 
accordingly  the manufacturing costs of these items in inventory are recorded as r d expense 
in cases where we maintain current approved products for further development evaluations  we may also provide valuation allowances for this inventory due to the historical uncertainties associated with regulated product introductions into other markets 
to the extent any of these products are sold to end users  we record revenues and reduce inventory reserves that are directly applicable to such products 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is reviewed at least annually  generally in the fourth quarter of each year 

table of contents factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreased market capitalization relative to net book value 
when there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
to date  there have been no indicators of impairment 
capitalized software costs we capitalize costs incurred in the development of computer software related to products under development after establishment of technological feasibility 
these capitalized costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are amortized over the estimated life of the related product 
at december   capitalized software development costs related to our tigris instrument totaled million  net of accumulated amortization 
we completed beta evaluations of this instrument for clinical diagnostic applications and undertook initial beta trials for blood screening applications before we completed a clinical trial for a diagnostic application in june in december  we received approval from the fda for testing our aptima combo assay on the tigris instrument 
we initiated clinical trials of our procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument for a blood screening application in january and filed a bla with the fda for this assay in september in october  the fda notified us that it considers our tigris instrument for blood screening not substantially equivalent to our already cleared esas for screening donated human blood with the procleix ultrio assay 
the fda made this determination in response to our k application for the tigris instrument for blood screening 
if we are not able to successfully deliver this instrument to the marketplace and attain customer acceptance  the asset could be impaired and an adjustment to the carrying value of this asset would be considered by management at that time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  we began amortizing the capitalized software costs on a straight line basis over months in may  coinciding with the general release of tigris instruments to our customers 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
in february  we entered into a supply and purchase agreement with roche whereby roche agreed to manufacture and supply us with oligonucleotides for hpv  which we plan to use in molecular diagnostic assays 
under this agreement  we paid roche manufacturing access fees of million in may and expect to pay million no later than december the initial million manufacturing access fee has been recorded as an intangible asset that  upon commercialization of our hpv oligonucleotides  will be amortized to cost of product sales over the economic life of the products 
periodically  we perform an impairment analysis to determine if we expect to recover these costs through the future sales of hpv products 
a decrease in forecasted sales may result in impairment charges in the future 
we expect to develop an hpv test and our current sales forecast indicates the payment is recoverable 

table of contents income taxes our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
as part of our assessment of potential adjustments to our tax returns  we increase our current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment 
we review  at least quarterly  the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become probable and estimable 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
future accounting requirements in december  the financial accounting standards board  fasb  issued revised statement  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
in april  the sec announced that the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective for the first quarter of we plan on adopting the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective application  which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
at december   unamortized compensation expense related to outstanding unvested options  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 was approximately million before income taxes 
in  we will begin to record this unamortized amount as stock compensation expense pursuant to the vesting schedules of the underlying option awards 
we will incur additional expense related to new awards granted after that cannot yet be quantified

product sales product sales increased to million in from million in the million increase was primarily attributed to million in higher instrument sales  million in higher blood screening sales  and million in higher aptima combo assay sales  partially offset by a million decrease in pace product sales 
blood screening sales represented million  or of product sales  in  compared to million  or of product sales in the increase in blood screening sales during was principally attributed to increased international procleix ultrio assay sales volume and an increase in instrument sales 
further  the current year s product sales included approximately million due to the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to united states blood screening products shipped to chiron s recently established third party warehouse  rather than directly to chiron s end customers 
product sales increased to million in from million in the million increase was principally the result of million in higher blood screening sales  both in the united states and international markets  a million increase in instrument sales  and a million increase in std product sales  primarily aptima 
blood screening sales represented million  or of product sales in  compared to million  or of product sales  in 
table of contents we expect increased competitive pressures related to our std and blood screening products in the future  primarily as a result of the introduction by others of competing products into both the std and blood screening markets  and continuing pricing pressure as it relates to the std market 
collaborative research revenue collaborative research revenue decreased in from the million decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in revenue due to completion of national institutes of health  or nih  funding of our wnv assay development work during  partially offset by a million increase in revenue for reimbursement from chiron for wnv assay development costs and million in revenue for shipments of discriminatory hbv  or dhbv  assays and tigris instrument lease revenue from chiron 
collaborative research revenue increased in from the million increase was primarily the result of a million increase in firm support commitment payments in connection with the wnv assay tests provided to united states customers through our collaboration with chiron  and a million increase in revenue for reimbursement from chiron for wnv assay development costs 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from the nih as our wnv assay funding was completed during and a million decrease in revenue for reimbursement from chiron of our development costs incurred on the procleix ultrio assay 
collaborative research revenue tends to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative research revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative research revenues depends  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
these relationships may not be established or maintained and current collaborative research revenue may decline 
in the event of fda approval of our procleix ultrio assay  we would expect chiron to implement commercial pricing related to the use of this product in the united states  which would result in an increase in product sales partially offset by a decrease in collaborative research revenue 
royalty and license revenue royalty and license revenue decreased in from the million decrease in royalty and license revenue during was principally attributed to i million in license fees earned from tosoh in as part of our non exclusive licensing agreement relating to nat technologies effective in january  ii a million milestone payment from chiron in as we began clinical trial testing of the procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument in the united states  effective in the first quarter of  and iii a million decrease in net license income from bayer for the licensing of rights to certain patented technology 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in license fee revenue recognized from biom rieux s affiliates in  which was based on the selection of targets pursuant to the terms of our september agreement with biom rieux  and a million increase in our share of royalties from chiron based upon chiron s agreement with laboratory corporation of america for use of chiron s hcv intellectual property for nat used in screening plasma donations in the united states 
royalty and license revenue increased in from the million increase was principally attributed to i million in license fees earned from tosoh as part of our non exclusive licensing agreement relating to nat technologies effective in january  and ii a million milestone payment from chiron as we began clinical trial testing of the procleix ultrio assay on our tigris instrument in the united states 
further  we recognized million of license revenue from bayer during for the licensing of rights to certain patented technology 
royalty and license revenue may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license revenue will depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we may not be able to do so and future royalty and license revenue may decline 

table of contents cost of product sales cost of product sales increased in from the million increase was principally attributed to increased sales of tigris instruments and spare parts to chiron million  higher blood screening shipments to international markets million  higher aptima shipments million and the amortization of capitalized software development costs million related to our tigris instrument  which began in the second quarter of cost of product sales increased in from the million increase was principally attributed to higher product shipments million  higher allowances for scrap expense million and the amortization of capitalized software development costs million related to our tigris instrument  which began in the second quarter of our gross profit margin as a percentage of product sales decreased to in  from in and in the decrease in gross profit margin percentage in from was principally attributed to increased sales of lower margin products  including tigris instruments and spare parts  higher international sales of blood screening products  which generally have had lower margin rates than domestic sales  and the amortization of capitalized software development costs  which began in the second quarter of the percentage decrease from was primarily the result of higher scrap expense  including expiration of enzymes that were produced in support of the procleix ultrio assay bla  increased sales of lower margin products including tigris instruments  and the amortization of capitalized software development costs  which began in the second quarter of  partially offset by lower unit costs on sales volume increases 
cost of product sales may fluctuate significantly in future periods based on changes in production volumes for both commercially approved products and products under development or in clinical trials 
cost of product sales are also affected by manufacturing efficiencies  allowances for scrap or expired materials  additional costs related to initial production quantities of new products after achieving fda approval  and contractual adjustments  such as instrumentation costs  instrument service costs and royalties 
we anticipate that requirements for smaller pool sizes or ultimately individual donor testing of blood samples  if and when implemented  could result in lower gross margin percentages  as additional tests would be required to deliver the sample results  unless a corresponding increase in sales pricing structure is implemented 
we are not able to accurately predict the timing and extent to which our gross margin percentage may be negatively affected as a result of smaller pool sizes or individual donor testing because we do not know the ultimate selling price that chiron  our distributor  would charge to the end user if smaller pool sizes or individual donor testing were implemented 
in general  international pool sizes are smaller than domestic pool sizes and  therefore  growth in blood screening revenues attributed to international expansion may lead to lower gross margin percentages 
research and development our r d expenses include salaries and other personnel related expenses  temporary personnel  outside services  laboratory and manufacturing supplies  pre commercial development lots and clinical evaluation trials 
r d expenses increased in from the million increase was primarily due to higher staffing levels to support development projects  such as prostate cancer and hpv million  and an increase in development lot production million  partially offset by reductions in clinical trials for blood screening products million  outside services related to tigris instrument development costs million  and lab supplies million 
r d expenses increased in from the million increase was primarily due to higher staffing levels to support product development projects and clinical trial efforts million  an increase in clinical trials for blood screening products million  an increase in outside development research due to our aggregate license fees paid to diagnocure and adnagen ag million  and an increase in r d expenses from our subsidiary  molecular light technology limited  or mlt  acquired in august million 
these increases were mostly offset by a million decrease in development lot production and lower per unit costs 

table of contents marketing and sales our marketing and sales expenses include personnel costs  promotional expenses  and outside services 
marketing and sales expenses increased in from the million increase was primarily due to a million increase in salaries  benefits  commissions and other personnel related costs in our marketing  sales  and technical service organization  together with a million increase in spending for market research and industry conventions to help support the tigris instrument and to assess new market opportunities  such as prostate cancer and hpv 
marketing and sales expenses increased in from the million increase was primarily due to a million increase in salaries  benefits  commissions and other personnel related costs in our marketing  sales  and technical service organization in order to support aptima market expansion and tigris instrument commercialization  and a million increase for advertising and promotional costs related to the marketing launch of our tigris instrument

these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in spending on professional fees as the costs associated with the bayer arbitration decreased 
g a expenses increased in from the million increase was primarily the result of a million increase in salaries  benefits and other expenses resulting from higher staffing levels  including million in expenses from our majority owned subsidiary  mlt  a million increase in patent and legal related expenses  including the costs of our ongoing arbitration with bayer  and a million non cash compensation charge related to the departure of a former executive 
total other income  net total other income  net  generally consists of investment and interest income offset by miscellaneous expense  minority interest  and other items 
the million net increase in from was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average balances of our short term investments and higher yields on our investment portfolio 
the million net decrease in total other income in from was primarily due to a million increase in realized foreign exchange rate losses 
income tax expense income tax expense increased in from to of pretax income  compared to of pretax income

table of contents liquidity and capital resources amount change from to in thousands december cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment included in investing activities above historically  we have financed our operations through cash from operations  cash received from collaborative research agreements  royalty and license fees  and cash from capital contributions 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities during from included a million growth in net current and deferred income taxes payable  a million increase in net income  a million increase in accounts payable  a million decrease in net inventory purchases  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization  partially offset by a million decrease in stock option income tax benefits 
the accounts payable change was attributed to acceleration of payments to our vendors in december  immediately prior to our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  software system 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to amortization on additional technology and software licenses that were purchased  along with the amortization of capitalized software development costs  which began in the second quarter of the decrease in net inventory purchases in from was attributed to the commercialization of our tigris instrument and the european launch of the procleix ultrio assay 
the million increase in our investing activities during included a million increase in capital expenditures and a million increase in purchases of various manufacturing  license and access fess  including a million manufacturing fee paid to roche 
further  during  we paid million plus accrued interest to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of mlt and million for preferred shares of molecular profiling institute  inc these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in purchases net of sales of short term investments 
our growth in capital expenditures was primarily due to the construction of our new building and costs of our erp system implementation 
our expenditures for capital additions vary based on the stage of certain development projects and may increase in the future related to the timing of development of new product opportunities and to support expansion of our facilities in connection with those opportunities 
we expect capital expenditures in to approximate spending 
the million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during from was principally attributed to a million decrease in employee purchases of our common stock made through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and a million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on a going forward basis  cash from financing activities will be affected by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and receipts from sales of stock under our espp 
we expect fluctuations to occur throughout the year  as the amount and frequency of stock related transactions are dependent upon the market performance of our common stock  along with other factors 

table of contents we have an unsecured bank line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which expires in july  under which we may borrow up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  at the bank s prime rate  or at libor plus 
we have not taken advances against the line of credit since its inception 
the line of credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial and restrictive covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in july  we commenced construction of an additional building to expand our main san diego campus 
this new building will consist of an approximately  square foot outside shell  with approximately  square feet built out with interior improvements 
the additional space that will not initially be built out will allow for future expansion 
the first phase of this project is currently estimated to cost approximately million  of which million was capitalized to construction in progress as of december  these costs are being capitalized as incurred and depreciation will commence upon our completion and use of the building  which is planned for mid we implemented a new erp system that cost approximately million in we incurred million in additional costs during and expect to incur approximately to million of costs in for further enhancements to our erp system

amounts represent our minimum purchase commitments from two key vendors for tigris instruments and raw materials used in manufacturing 
of the million expected to be purchased for tigris instruments  we anticipate that approximately million will be reimbursed by chiron 
in addition to the minimum payments due under our collaborative agreements  we may be required to pay up to million in milestone payments  plus royalties on net sales of any products using specified technology 
further  if we exercise our option to develop a point of sample nat instrument  we are required to purchase an equity interest in qualigen for approximately million and we may pay up to million based on development milestones 
does not include amounts relating to our obligations under our collaboration with chiron  pursuant to which both parties have obligations to each other 
we are obligated to manufacture and supply our blood screening assay to chiron  and chiron is obligated to purchase all of the quantities of this assay specified on a day demand forecast  due days prior to the date chiron intends to take delivery  and certain quantities specified on a rolling month forecast 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation 
the payments related to the deferred compensation are not included in the table above since they are dependent upon when certain key employees retire or otherwise leave the company 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for expansion of our san diego campus  continued research and development of new products  costs related to commercialization of blood screening products and purchases of the tigris instrument for placement with our customers 
certain research and development costs may be funded under collaboration agreements with partners 

table of contents we believe that our available cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises  and available line of credit  will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or from additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
further  debt financing may subject us to covenants restricting our operations 
in august  we filed a form s shelf registration statement with the sec relating to the possible future sale of up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities 
to date  we have not raised any funds under this registration statement 
we may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses and or technologies complementary to our business 
we could require additional equity or debt financing if we were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
we do not currently have and have never had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in short term investment grade securities 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our current investment balance by approximately million annually 
while changes in our interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses are not recognized in our statement of income until the investment is sold or if a reduction in fair value is determined to be a permanent impairment 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk although the majority of our revenue is realized in united states dollars  some portions of our revenue are realized in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the functional currencies of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the british pound 
accordingly  the accounts of these operations are translated from the local currency to the united states dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for the balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk for expenditures in certain foreign countries  but the total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies as of december  were not material 
under our collaboration agreement with chiron  a growing portion of blood screening product sales is from western european countries 
as a result  our international blood screening product sales are affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of those countries where chiron s business is conducted in euros or other local currencies 
we do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
based on international blood screening product sales during  a movement of currency exchange rates would result in a blood screening product sales increase or decrease of approximately million 
we believe that our business operations are not exposed to market risk relating to commodity price risk
