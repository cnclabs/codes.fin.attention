item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  product launches and late stage product pipeline developments  and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent  due in part to the launch in of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets 
in addition  we launched one new product in the us and several new products  new indications  or new formulations in key markets in we continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities  resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales 
despite product launch expenditures  our cost containment and productivity measures 
table of contents contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales 
during  we began to expense stock options  which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses 
we also benefited from an increase in net other income due primarily to increased profitability of the lilly icos joint venture and a decrease in the tax rate in net income was billion  or per share  in as compared with billion  or per share  in  representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of percent 
net income comparisons between and are also affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results see notes       and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters  primarily related to zyprexa  of billion pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
in the second quarter of notes and 
in  we began to expense stock options in accordance with sfas r 
had we expensed stock options in  our net income would have been lower by million  which would have decreased earnings per share by 
per share notes and 
we recognized asset impairment and other special charges of million pretax in the fourth quarter  which decreased earnings per share by 
note 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 in the fourth quarter of the adoption of fin resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million after tax  which decreased earnings per share by 
note 
revenues graph 
table of contents we recognized asset impairment charges  streamlined our infrastructure  and provided for the anticipated resolution of the government investigation of evista marketing and promotional practices  resulting in charges of million pretax in the second quarter and million pretax in the fourth quarter  which decreased earnings per share by 
and  respectively note 
we incurred charges for acquired in process research and development ipr d of million no tax benefit in the first quarter related to the acquisition of applied molecular evolution  inc ame  and million pretax in the fourth quarter related to our acquisition of a phase i compound currently under development as a potential treatment for insomnia  which decreased earnings per share by 
in the first quarter and 
in the fourth quarter note 
as discussed further in financial condition  we recognized tax expenses of million in the fourth quarter associated with the anticipated repatriation in of billion of our earnings reinvested outside the us  as a result of the passage of the american jobs creation act of ajca 
this tax expense decreased earnings per share by 
in that quarter note 
recent product launches and late stage product pipeline developments our long term success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and late stage pipeline developments  including we are in the process of rolling out the global launches of a number of new products  including alimta  byetta  cialis  cymbalta  forteo  strattera  symbyax  and yentreve 
in addition  we recently launched new indications or formulations of alimta  cymbalta  gemzar  humatrope  and zyprexa 
we launched cymbalta for the treatment of major depressive disorder in the us in august in september  cymbalta received its second us approval and became the first fda approved treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain dpnp 
cymbalta was launched in the united kingdom and germany in the first quarter of for the treatment of major depressive episodes 
other launches in the european union are expected to occur throughout the european commission also granted marketing authorization of cymbalta for the treatment of dpnp in adults in july cymbalta has achieved million in us sales since its launch 
in june  lilly and amylin pharmaceuticals  inc  launched byetta exenatide  the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics  in the us for the treatment of type diabetes 
in the fourth quarter of  we submitted byetta for the treatment of type diabetes in europe 
we expect to advance our pipeline during with three significant submissions anticipated  including arxxant tm for diabetic retinopathy  cymbalta for generalized anxiety disorder  and evista for breast cancer risk reduction in postmenopausal women 

table of contents legal and governmental matters certain generic manufacturers have challenged our us compound patent for zyprexa and are seeking permission to market generic versions of zyprexa prior to its patent expiration in on april   the us district court in indianapolis ruled in our favor on all counts  upholding our patents 
the decision has been appealed 
in  we entered into an agreement with plaintiffs attorneys involved in certain us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims against us relating to the medication 
we established a fund of million for the claimants who agree to settle their claims 
additionally  we paid million to cover administration of the settlement 
as a result of our product liability exposures  the substantial majority of which were related to zyprexa  we recorded a net pretax charge of billion in the second quarter of in march  we were notified by the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania that it has commenced a civil investigation relating to our us sales  marketing  and promotional practices 
in the united states  implementation of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma  which provides a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program  took effect january  while it is difficult to predict the business impact of this legislation  we currently anticipate a modest short term increase in sales 
however  in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures 
while the mma prohibits the secretary of health and human services hhs from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers  we expect continued challenges to that prohibition over the next several years 
also  the mma retains the authority of the secretary of hhs to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs  but we expect congress to consider several measures that could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the us regardless of their safety or cost 
if adopted  such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our us sales 
we believe there is some chance that the new and expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the mma will alleviate the need for a federal importation scheme 
as a result of the passage of the mma  aged and disabled patients jointly eligible for medicare and medicaid began receiving their prescription drug benefits through the medicare program  instead of medicaid  on january  this may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level 
a majority of states have begun to implement supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs  and these programs are expected to continue in the post mma environment 
several states are also attempting to extend discounted medicaid prices to non medicaid patients 
additionally  notwithstanding the federal law prohibiting drug importation  approximately a dozen states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens  usually involving a website that links patients to selected canadian pharmacies 
one state has such a program for its state employees 
as a result  we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue 
international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 

table of contents operating results sales our worldwide sales for increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta  alimta  forteo  and gemzar 
as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early  reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera  prozac  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately million 
sales growth in was also affected by decreased us demand for zyprexa  strattera  and prozac 
despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand  sales in the us increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta and alimta 
sales outside the us increased percent  to billion  driven by growth of zyprexa  alimta  and gemzar 
worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of percent  with global selling prices contributing percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing percent

cialis had worldwide sales of million  representing an increase of percent compared with the sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market cialis exclusively 
the remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of lilly icos llc north america  excluding puerto rico  and europe 
our share of the joint venture territory sales  net of expenses  is reported in net other income in our consolidated income statement 

table of contents zyprexa  our top selling product  is a treatment for schizophrenia  bipolar mania  and bipolar maintenance 
zyprexa sales in the us decreased percent in  resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures 
sales outside the us in increased percent  driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates 
excluding the impact of exchange rates  sales of zyprexa outside the us increased by percent 
in september  the national institute of mental health released the results of its clinical antipsychotic trial of intervention effectiveness catie study  which showed that zyprexa was statistically superior on time to discontinuation in patients with schizophrenia as compared to other medications 
patients taking zyprexa also experienced significantly fewer hospitalizations for schizophrenia than patients taking other medications 
in addition  the study noted that zyprexa patients experienced greater weight gain and increases in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism than patients using other antipsychotics 
diabetes care products  composed primarily of humalog  our insulin analog  humulin  a biosynthetic human insulin  actos  an oral agent for the treatment of type diabetes  and recently launched byetta  the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for type diabetes that we market with amylin pharmaceuticals  had aggregate worldwide revenues of billion in  an increase of percent 
diabetes care revenues in the us increased percent  to billion  primarily driven by higher prices  offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins 
diabetes care revenues outside the us increased percent  to billion 
humalog sales increased percent in the us and percent outside the us humulin sales in the us decreased percent  while humulin sales outside the us increased percent 
actos revenues  the majority of which represent service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the us with takeda pharmaceuticals north america takeda  increased percent in actos is manufactured by takeda chemical industries  ltd  and sold in the us by takeda 
our us marketing rights with respect to actos expire in september  however  we will continue receiving royalties from takeda 
as a result  our revenues from actos will decline each year from through our arrangement in the us ceases after october sales of byetta were million following its june launch 
we report as revenue our percent share of byetta s gross margin and our sales of byetta pen delivery devices to amylin 
this revenue totaled million in sales of gemzar  a product approved to fight various cancers  increased percent in the us sales growth in the us in was negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers 
gemzar sales increased percent outside the us  driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications 

table of contents gross margin graph sales of evista  a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis  decreased percent in the us due to a decline in us underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels 
this decline was partially offset by price increases 
outside the us  sales of evista increased percent  driven by volume growth in several markets and the early launch of the product in japan 
cymbalta was launched in the us in late august for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in september for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain 
cymbalta launches began in europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of  with additional launches expected through cymbalta has been well accepted  generating million in sales in sales of strattera  the only nonstimulant medicine approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children  adolescents  and adults  declined percent in the us in due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand 
sales outside the us were million in  compared with million in  primarily reflecting recent launches in australia  canada  germany  mexico  and spain 
in the third quarter of  we announced an important update to the strattera label  communicating new information regarding uncommon reports of suicidal thoughts among children and adolescents 
we have added a boxed warning to the label in the us and are working with other regulatory agencies in countries where strattera is approved to update the label information appropriately 
alimta was launched in the us in february for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in august for second line treatment of non small cell lung cancer nsclc 
alimta was launched in several european countries in the second half of and throughout alimta generated sales of million in 
table of contents forteo  a treatment for both men and postmenopausal women suffering from severe osteoporosis  increased percent in the us in  driven by strong growth in underlying demand 
sales growth was offset  in part  by wholesaler destocking in the first half of related to our new arrangements with us wholesalers 
cialis  an erectile dysfunction treatment  is promoted in north america and europe jointly by lilly and icos corporation  and by lilly exclusively in the rest of the world 
the million of worldwide cialis sales in  an increase of percent compared to  comprises million of sales in our territories  which are reported in our net sales  and million of sales in the joint venture territories 
within the joint venture territories  us sales of cialis were million for  an increase of percent  despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers 
cialis continues to increase its market share in most major markets in this extremely competitive category 
animal health product sales in the us increased percent  while sales outside the us increased percent  led by rumensin and paylean 
gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin decreased to percent of sales compared with percent for the decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses  partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses 
key sales growth graph operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  in  due to the adoption of stock option expensing in  decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners  and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses 
we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing 
table of contents approximately percent of our sales into research and development during marketing and administrative expenses increased percent in  to billion  due to the adoption of stock option expensing in  and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses 
this comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the lilly foundation during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses would have increased by percent  and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for  if had been restated as if stock options had been expensed 
research and development graph net other income for increased million  to million  primarily due to the lilly icos llc joint venture becoming profitable during and increased interest income  partially offset by less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development 
we report our percent share of the operating results of the lilly icos joint venture in our net other income 
for  our net income from the joint venture was million  compared with a net loss of million in the joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of interest expense for increased million  to million  primarily due to an increase in interest rates 
the effective tax rate for was percent  compared with percent for the effective tax rate for was affected by the product liability charge of billion 
the tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate  as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge 
the effective tax rate for was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of billion of earnings reinvested outside the us pursuant to the ajca and the charge for acquired ipr d related to the ame acquisition  which is not deductible for tax purposes

certain items  reflected in our operating results for and  should be considered in comparing the two years 
the significant items for are summarized in the executive overview 
the items are summarized as follows see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we recognized asset impairments  primarily relating to manufacturing assets in the us  and streamlined our infrastructure  resulting in severance related and other charges totaling million pretax in the first quarter and million pretax in the fourth quarter  which decreased earnings per share by approximately 
and 
in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively note 
separately  we recognized asset impairments and other charges of million pretax in the first quarter of related primarily to our common stock ownership and loan agreements with isis pharmaceuticals  inc isis  which decreased earnings per share by 
in that quarter note 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million pretax related to the sale of patent rights to dapoxetine for development in the field of genitourinary disorders to ppd  inc  which increased earnings per share by 
in that quarter

sales of evista increased percent in the us due to continued competitive pressures 
outside the us  evista maintained a strong growth rate of percent  driven by volume growth in several markets and the early launch of the product in japan 
in  strattera generated an percent increase over sales despite a very competitive landscape 
in december  we added a bolded warning to the product label  which indicates that the medication should be discontinued in patients with jaundice yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes or in the event of laboratory evidence of liver injury 
forteo generated million in sales in  continuing the product s strong growth trajectory following its us launch in december and european launches in late and during the million of worldwide cialis sales in  an increase of percent compared to  comprises million of sales in our territories  which are reported in our net sales  and million of sales in the joint venture territories

gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin decreased to percent of sales compared with percent for the decrease was due primarily to continued investment in our manufacturing technical capabilities and capacity and the impact of foreign exchange rates  offset partially by favorable changes in product mix due to growth in sales of higher margin products 
operating expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  due to increased clinical trial and development expenses and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses  partially offset by reimbursements for research activities from our collaboration partners

marketing and administrative expenses increased percent in  to billion  attributable primarily to increased selling expenses in support of the new and anticipated product launches  the impact of foreign exchange rates  increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses  increased charitable contributions to the lilly foundation  and increased product liability expenses  offset partially by ongoing marketing cost containment measures and marketing expense reimbursement from collaboration partners 
a majority of the reimbursements are ongoing 
net other income for increased million to million

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  cash flow from operations of billion and net issuances of long term debt of billion were more than offset by net repayments of short term debt of billion  dividends paid of billion  capital expenditures of billion  net purchases of noncurrent investments of million  and repurchases of common stock of million 
capital expenditures of billion during were million less than in  due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects 
we expect near term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as levels while we continue to invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care and other products  as well as research and development activities 
total debt at december   was billion  essentially unchanged compared to december  our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s remain at aa and aa  respectively 
dividends of per share were paid in  an increase of percent from in the fourth quarter of  effective for the first quarter dividend in  the quarterly dividend was increased to 
per share a percent increase  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
the year was the st consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 
dividends paid graphic 
table of contents on october   president bush signed into law the american jobs creation act of ajca  which created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
we planned to repatriate billion in incentive dividends  as defined in the ajca  during and accordingly  we recorded a related tax liability of million as of december  during  we repatriated all billion of eligible incentive dividends 
the proceeds from the incentive dividends have been or will be used for research and development activities  capital asset expenditures  and other permitted activities 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  dividends  and taxes in we believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of short term borrowings  if necessary 
our commercial paper program is also currently backed by billion of unused committed bank credit facilities 
we currently expect to repay approximately billion of debt by the end of  using available cash 
various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in the financial expectations for section  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
shareholders equity graph our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between 
table of contents fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
these arrangements are not material individually 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same year  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur  as the failure rate for products in development is very high 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 

table of contents our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period less more than than total year years years years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included our long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
this category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  the amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales rebate and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
this is generally at the time products are shipped to the customer  typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 

table of contents we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
we are generally able to determine when significant wholesaler stocking or destocking has occurred during a particular period  but we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
causes of unusual buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
an unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the us could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend 
as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early  reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera  prozac  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately million 
the new structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying we have seen in the past and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our us wholesalers 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns  which have been approximately percent or less of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales 
sales rebates discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  discount card programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate discount contracts 
we calculate these rebates discounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups 
the largest of our sales rebate discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate discount contracts 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit  we adjust our rebate reserves 

table of contents we believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs reduced sales by million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the medicaid rebate expense we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
as of december   our medicaid rebate liability was million 
approximately percent and percent of our global rebate and discount liability results from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us rebate and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions rebate and discount liability  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates rebate and discount liability  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial position of the insurers  and the possibility of and the length of time for collection 
we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 

table of contents periodically  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent to percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve for purposes of determination of the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by approximately million 
if the discount rate for were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately million 
if the expected return on plan assets for were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would change by approximately million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle would be affected by approximately million 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
the tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances  and additional uncertainties 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances reserved against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately million 

table of contents financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to 
we expect sales to grow to percent and gross margins as a percent of sales to improve modestly compared with in addition  we expect operating expenses to grow in the mid single digits in the aggregate  with marketing and administrative expenses accelerating while research and development expense growth moderates somewhat 
however  we will continue to be among the industry leaders in terms of research and development investment as a percent of sales 
we also expect other income  net of interest expense  to contribute approximately million to million  this ongoing net contribution is expected to be driven primarily by net interest income  lilly icos joint venture after tax profit  and partnering and out licensing of molecules 
we also anticipate the effective tax rate to be approximately percent 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges  foreign exchange rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation  and government investigations  the outcome of the zyprexa patent appeal  and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals

an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations 
in july  we received the first of several grand jury subpoenas for documents from the office of consumer litigation  us department of justice  related to our marketing and promotional practices and physician communications with respect to evista 
we reached a settlement with the us department of justice in the fourth quarter of  which was subsequently approved by the us district court for the southern district of indiana in february as part of the settlement  lilly pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the plea is for the off label promotion of evista during the government did not  however  charge the company with any unlawful intent  nor do we acknowledge any such intent 
in connection with the overall settlement  we agreed to pay a total of million 
as previously reported  lilly took a charge in the fourth quarter of in connection with this investigation 
the charge was sufficient to cover this settlement payment  consequently  no further charge will be necessary 
in march  the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania advised us that it has commenced a civil investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices  including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors  with respect to zyprexa  prozac  and prozac weekly tm 
in october  the us attorney s office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering axid  evista  humalog  humulin  prozac  and zyprexa 
the inquiry includes a review of lilly s medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements 
we are cooperating with the us attorney in these investigations  including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations 
in june  we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general  medicaid fraud control unit  of the state of florida  seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines  penalties  or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome 
it is possible  however  that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on 
table of contents our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices  physician communications  remuneration of health care professionals  managed care arrangements  and medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations 
we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the united states and have been notified of several thousand claims of individuals who have not filed suit 
the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the claims allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 

the mdl includes three lawsuits requesting certification of class actions on behalf of those who allegedly suffered injuries from the administration of zyprexa 
we have entered into agreements with various plaintiffs counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitation tolling agreements with respect to a large number of claimants who do not have lawsuits on file 
in june  we entered into an agreement in principle followed by a definitive master settlement agreement in september with a group of plaintiffs attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a majority of the claims 
the agreement covers more than  claimants  including a large number of previously filed lawsuits including the three purported class actions  tolled claims  and other informally asserted claims 
we established a fund of million for the claimants to settle their claims  and million to cover administration of the settlement 
the settlement fund is being overseen and distributed by claims administrators appointed by the court 
the agreement and the distribution of funds to participating claimants are conditioned upon  among other things  our obtaining full releases from no fewer than  claimants 
following this settlement  the remaining us zyprexa product liability claims include approximately lawsuits in the us covering claimants  and approximately tolled claims 
in addition  we have been informally advised of a number of additional potential us claims  but to date have received no substantiation of the claims 
also  in early  we were served with five lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa 
the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the united states 
we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining cases 
in  two lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which have made or will make payments on account of their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit  which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil rico statute  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
in addition  in a similar lawsuit was filed in the eastern district of new york on similar grounds 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
in december  we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals  alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed 
table of contents to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york 
in these actions  the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs  as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexa related illnesses 
in connection with the zyprexa product liability claims  certain of our insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and to date have failed to reimburse us for claim related costs despite demand from the first layer carriers for payment 
however  in our opinion  the defenses identified to date appear to lack substance 
in march  we filed suit against several of the carriers in state court in indiana to obtain reimbursement of costs related to the zyprexa product liability litigation 
the matter has been removed to the federal court in indianapolis 
several carriers have asserted defenses to their liability  and some carriers are seeking rescission of the coverage 
while we believe our position is meritorious  there can be no assurance that we will prevail 
in addition  we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal 
with respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us  we have accrued for our estimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and estimable based on the information available to us 
in addition  we have accrued for certain product liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingencies are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable 
a portion of the costs associated with defending and disposing of these suits is covered by insurance 
we record receivables for insurance related recoveries when it is probable they will be realized 
these receivables are classified as a reduction of the litigation charges on the statement of income 
we estimate insurance recoverables based on existing deductibles  coverage limits  our assessment of any defenses to coverage that might be raised by the carriers  and the existing and projected future level of insolvencies among the insurance carriers 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a net pre tax charge of billion for product liability matters  which includes the following the million zyprexa settlement and administration fee  reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding currently known and expected claims to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims 
a substantial majority of these exposures and costs relate to current and expected zyprexa claims not included in the settlement 
we have estimated these charges based primarily on historical claims experience  data regarding product usage  and our historical product liability defense cost experience 
the billion net charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters 
the after tax impact of this net charge was 
per share 
the million for the zyprexa settlement was paid during  while the cash related to the other reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs is expected to be paid out over the next several years 
the timing of our insurance recoveries is uncertain 
we cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted 
in addition  although we believe it is probable  there can be no assurance that the zyprexa 
table of contents settlement described above will be concluded 
the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we are subject to a substantial number of product liability claims  and because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability claims for other products in the future 
we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market  and therefore will be largely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims 
while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the patent  product liability  or other legal actions brought against us  we believe that  except as noted above  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period
