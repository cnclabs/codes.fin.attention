overview we provide credit debit card cash advance ccca  atm and check cashing solutions cash access services to casinos  a majority of which are owned and operated by native american tribes 
these products are the primary means by which casinos make cash available to gaming patrons 
we also provide casinos with ancillary services such as on line reporting  which enhances their ability to monitor player activity and market to gaming patrons 
at december   our cash access services were utilized at gaming locations and retail locations nationwide 
with our february  acquisition of indian gaming services  we added more casinos as customers 
in addition  the acquisition provides us with access to other credit and debit processing opportunities 
credit card cash advances and pos debit card transactions our ccca products  which are comprised of both all in atms and company kiosks which house point of sale pos terminals  have been installed at over casinos 
our ccca products allow gaming patrons to obtain cash from their credit card  or checking account in the case of debit transactions  through the use of our software and equipment 
a gaming patron can initiate a ccca transaction through one of our all in atms or kiosks 
the all in atm or kiosk terminal will prompt the gaming patron to swipe his her credit or debit card and enter the dollar amount requested 
the all in atm or kiosk terminal will then dial the appropriate bank for an authorization or disapproval 
if authorized  the all in atm or kiosk terminal will direct the gaming patron to a casino cage 
once at the cage  the gaming patron will present his her credit debit card and driver s license 
a cage cashier will swipe the credit debit card in a company terminal which communicates with the all in atm or kiosk terminal 
the purpose of the second swipe is for identification purposes only 
after finding the approved transaction  the cage terminal will provide the cashier with two options in order to obtain the gaming patron s address  driver s license and telephone number  which must be imprinted on each check 
the first option is to swipe the gaming patron s driver s license if it contains a magnetic strip 
the second option is to manually enter the information into the terminal 
after one of these options is selected  a printer attached to the cage terminal will generate a company check 
the cashier will give the gaming patron cash in the amount requested after he she signs the company check 
our check is then deposited by the casino into its account for payment from a company account and we debit the gaming patron s credit or debit card 
this transaction can be accomplished without the gaming patron using a personal identification number pin 
gaming patrons pay a service charge typically between for credit card advances and a fixed fee plus for pos debit card withdrawals 

table of contents atm cash withdrawals we offer a full menu of atm services to casinos and retailers 
through our standard atms and our all in atms  vault cash for the operation of the atm can be provided by us or directly by the casino or retailer 
if the casino or retailer provides the vault cash  we pay a fee to the casino or retailer for the use of such cash 
we process atm transactions through atm networks with which we have licensing agreements 
in addition  through lease agreements  we provide atm vault cash  maintenance and armored car service 
in an atm cash withdrawal  a gaming patron directly withdraws funds from his or her bank account by swiping an atm card through one of our standard atms or all in atms 
our processor then routes the transaction request through an electronic funds transfer network to the gaming patron s bank 
if the transaction is authorized  the atm dispenses the cash to the gaming patron 
gaming patrons pay a fixed fee for atm cash withdrawals 
check cashing solutions we also offer two check cashing solutions to the gaming industry 
first  we provide casinos with full service check cashing 
with full service check cashing  we are given space within a casino to operate a check cashing business 
our employees manage the booth  our cash is used to cash checks  and we retain customer fees from check cashing 
gaming patrons pay a service charge based on the amount of the transaction for our check cashing services 
at december   there were approximately casinos utilizing our full service check cashing services 
second  we provide check guarantee services with the assistance of third party providers and check verification services 
during  we processed approximately billion  as compared to billion during  in cash advance  atm and check cashing transactions  reflecting the greater number of casinos that used our cash access services  as well as increases in the volumes of businesses from our current casino customers 
during  we generated revenues of million  a increase over our revenues from our operating expenses in increased to million  from million in our increased operating expenses in reflect our investment of substantial time and money to build our internal human resources and technology infrastructure 
this was necessitated by both the need to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of sox and to position the company for future growth in its current market and expansion into new markets 
we continually seek to develop new technology that will make cash advance transactions more convenient for customers 
for example  we previously created a wireless cash advance system that allows gaming patrons to complete a transaction from remote areas of the casino  such as a slot machine or gaming table 
we are placing an emphasis on expanding our wireless cash advance system and cashless gaming systems 
over the past two years  we have entered into several strategic alliances with certegy  tdn money systems  progressive gaming international and western money systems 
these alliances have allowed us to expand our product offerings and enter into markets that we have not previously serviced 
we continue to look for additional partnerships and alliances as we move ahead as part of our overall growth strategy

the increase in personnel reflected in the increased payroll expense is part of our plan to establish sufficient infrastructure to enable us to grow on a going forward basis and is part of our plan to for managing sox compliance more efficiently and effectively in the future

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis or plan of operation is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  collectibility of loans receivable  the lives and continued usefulness of property and equipment and contingencies 
due to uncertainties  however  it is at least reasonably possible that our estimates will change during the next year 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which requires that a strict series of criteria are met in order to recognize revenue related to services provided 
if these criteria are not met  the associated revenue is deferred until the criteria are met 
we recognize commission revenue when evidence of a transaction exists  services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the reasonable assurance is based on the transactions being authorized and preapproved by credit card vendors or third parties 
we evaluate our commissions revenue streams for proper timing of revenue recognition
