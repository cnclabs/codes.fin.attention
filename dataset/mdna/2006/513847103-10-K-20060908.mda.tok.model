item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products including specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets  glassware and candles for the retail  floral  industrial and foodservice markets  and automotive accessories for the original equipment market and aftermarket 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important in understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended june  and our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june unless otherwise noted  references to year pertain to our fiscal year  for example  refers to fiscal  which is the period from july  to june  in the discussion that follows  we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity and contractual obligations 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we have made which we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere herein 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this document involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
in april  we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives  including potential divestitures  among our nonfood operations 
this process is ongoing with the assistance of outside financial advisors  but there is no assurance that any specific transaction will result nor as to any terms or timing thereof 
we do not expect to provide updates on this process except as necessary to meet regulatory disclosure requirements 
throughout most of the third quarter of  our oklahoma glassware facility had a planned temporary idling of most production activities that resulted in over million of unabsorbed pretax costs being incurred 
while this idling had a significant impact on the glassware and candles segment s financial results for the quarter  we were able to significantly reduce our glassware inventories as a result 
on november   the board voted to increase the regular quarterly cash dividend to 
per common share from the first quarter dividend of 
per common share 
the board also approved a special cash dividend of per common share at that time 
the board later approved regular quarterly cash dividends of 
per common share each for the third and fourth quarters of total dividends paid for the year were million 
we recorded other income for proceeds received from the cdsoa for the year ended june  of million compared to million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  this income represents distributions we received from the us government under cdsoa 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress unfair dumping of imported products through cash payments to eligible affected companies 
such payments are in part dependent upon the amount of antidumping duties collected by the us government on those products 
the world trade organization has previously ruled that such payments are inconsistent with international trade rules 
in february  legislation was enacted to repeal the applicability of cdsoa to duties collected on imported products entered into the united states after september in july  the us court of international trade cit ruled unconstitutional cdsoa s requirement that a company that is not a petitioner must indicate its support for an antidumping petition in order to be eligible for a distribution 
the cit has not ruled on other matters  including any remedy as a result of its ruling 
we expect that the ruling of the cit will be appealed 
while cdsoa continues to be in effect in the united states at this time  uncertainties associated with this program leave us unable to predict the amounts  if any  we may be entitled to receive in the future 

table of contents on july   we sold our indirect subsidiary  colony printing labeling  for net proceeds of approximately million 
the loss recorded on the sale was approximately million 
colony printing labeling was part of our glassware and candles segment and was not deemed material for presentation as a discontinued operation 
forward looking statements we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra 
this annual report on form k contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra and other applicable securities laws 
such statements can be identified by the use of the forward looking words anticipate  estimate  project  believe  intend  expect  hope  or similar words 
these statements discuss future expectations  contain projections regarding future developments  operations or financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
such statements are based upon assumptions and assessments made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments  and other factors we believe to be appropriate 
these forward looking statements involve various important risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results may differ as a result of factors over which we have no  or limited  control including the strength of the economy  slower than anticipated sales growth  the extent of operational efficiencies achieved  the success of new product introductions  price and product competition  and increases in energy and raw material costs 
management believes these forward looking statements to be reasonable  however  undue reliance should not be placed on such statements that are based on current expectations 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements 
specific influences relating to these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to the potential for loss of larger programs or key customer relationships  the effect of consolidation of customers within key market channels  the continued solvency of key customers  the success and cost of new product development efforts  the lack of market acceptance of new products  changes in demand for our products  which may result from loss of brand reputation or customer goodwill  changes in market trends  the extent to which future business acquisitions are completed and acceptably integrated  the possible occurrence of product recalls  efficiencies in plant operations  including the ability to optimize overhead utilization in nonfood operations  fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials  adverse changes in energy costs and other factors that may affect costs of producing  distributing or transporting our products  maintenance of competitive position with respect to other manufacturers  including import sources of production  dependence on key personnel  stability of labor relations  fluctuations in energy costs  dependence on contract copackers  effect of governmental regulations  including environmental matters  legislation and litigation affecting the future administration of cdsoa  changes in income tax laws  start up of our new food production facility in kentucky in  
table of contents the outcome of our exploration of strategic alternatives  changes in estimates in critical accounting judgments  and innumerable other factors 
summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated results for the year ended june  net sales for the year ended june  increased to  million from the prior year total of  million 
this sales growth was driven by increased sales in the specialty foods and automotive segments 
gross margin declined to million from the prior year comparable total of million as influenced by factors such as higher freight and energy costs  as well as higher raw material costs in the nonfood segments 
in the third quarter of  we also incurred significant costs associated with the temporary idling of most production activities at our sapulpa  oklahoma glassware manufacturing facility in the glassware and candles segment 
with respect to the higher costs we experienced for freight  many nonfood raw materials and energy  we were able to implement a limited number of price increases and are striving to implement additional selected price increases to reduce the impact of these higher costs 
we are also working to otherwise mitigate the impact of these increased costs  including changing various manufacturing processes  but these efforts may lag the adverse effect of the higher costs 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under cdsoa 
in  we received million under cdsoa  as compared to million in and million in net income for the current year was million or per diluted share  compared to million or per diluted share in the prior year 
we were able to maintain a strong balance sheet with no debt throughout review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income

net sales specialty foods glassware and candles automotive total gross margin gross margin as a percent of sales 
table of contents consolidated net sales reached  million during  increasing as compared to prior year sales of  million  with growth coming from the specialty foods and automotive segments 
in the specialty foods segment  the increase in sales reflected internal growth  particularly in refrigerated dressings and frozen breads and rolls  while the sales increase was impacted by a business acquisition that contributed approximately million growth 
in our nonfood segments  automotive growth was largely driven by increased sales of aluminum accessories  while competitive market conditions contributed to lower sales in the glassware and candles segment 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in and in higher levels of freight  energy and nonfood raw material costs were prevalent throughout a significant influence affecting the over decline was the presence of increasing nonfood raw material costs and our limited ability to obtain much cost recovery through higher pricing of our products

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense as a percent of sales selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled million and increased  as compared with the total of million  while the total had increased from the total of million 
included in these totals were recoveries of bad debt associated with the bankruptcy filing of kmart corporation totaling million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
we wrote off approximately million related to this bankruptcy in selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively stable as a percentage of sales for the years ended june   and restructuring and impairment charge in the third quarter of  we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million million after taxes related to certain automotive manufacturing equipment 
this impairment occurred due to the idling of the equipment that was used for a specific product that is no longer being produced 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million million after taxes relating to certain equipment in two of our business segments 
approximately million of the charge related to the impairment of glassware manufacturing equipment in our glassware and candles segment 
approximately million of the charge related to the impairment of certain idle manufacturing equipment in our automotive segment 
these impairments occurred due to inefficient production and a slowdown in demand for certain products associated with this equipment 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes for costs incurred as of june  related to the closing of our automotive floor mat manufacturing facility located in waycross  georgia 
manufacturing effectively ceased as of june  the decision to close the plant was brought on by a decline in demand for compression molded rubber floor mats that resulted in excess segment capacity 
the cash costs associated with this closure totaled approximately million and included termination benefits and other closing costs  such as costs to remove and relocate certain equipment  costs to prepare the building for sale  and various other charges 
approximately million of the restructuring and impairment charge related to this facility s impairment of property  plant and equipment 
during  we recorded an additional restructuring and impairment charge of million million after taxes for costs incurred during that period 
the majority of this charge resulted in cash outlays and consisted of other closing costs  such as costs to maintain the building and various other charges 
during  both the new costs incurred and the cash outlays made for the required upkeep of the facility were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements

see further discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of net income per common share below 
other income expense in november and december and  we received approximately million  million  and million  respectively  from the us government under cdsoa 
these amounts were recorded within the accompanying financial statements as other income 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress the unfair dumping of imported products through annual cash payments to eligible affected companies 
such payments are in part dependent upon the amount of antidumping duties collected on those products 
the world trade organization has previously ruled that such payments are inconsistent with international trade rules 
in february  legislation was enacted to repeal the applicability of cdsoa to duties collected on imported products entered into the united states after september in july  the us court of international trade cit ruled unconstitutional cdsoa s requirement that a company that is not a petitioner must indicate its support for an antidumping petition in order to be eligible for a distribution 
the cit has not ruled on other matters  including any 
table of contents remedy as a result of its ruling 
we expect that the ruling of the cit will be appealed 
while cdsoa continues to be in effect in the united states at this time  uncertainties associated with this program leave us unable to predict the amounts  if any  we may be entitled to receive in the future 
income before income taxes as affected by the factors discussed above  our income before income taxes for of million decreased from the total of million 
the total income before tax was million 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was influenced by changes in state tax laws within ohio  an increased deduction for dividends paid to the esop plan due to the per share special dividend paid in december  and the new federal deduction created by the american jobs creation act related to domestic manufacturing activities 
the decline in the rate was influenced by an increase in tax free interest income and a change in state tax laws within ohio 
net income per common share diluted earnings per share for totaled  a decrease from the prior year total of 
the latter amount was more than diluted earnings per share of 
earnings per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  segment review specialty foods record net sales were again achieved by the specialty foods segment during  and operating income of million increased from the level of million  as the benefits from the higher sales volumes and relatively stable ingredient costs were somewhat offset by higher freight and energy costs 
net sales during totaled million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
sales for increased over the total of million 
the percentage of retail customer sales was approximately during compared to in and the sales increase experienced in resulted from internally generated growth 
most of this growth was volume driven  although a limited level of increased pricing on retail product was implemented  which largely benefited the second half of the fiscal year 
among retail products  the growth was primarily in refrigerated produce dressings with new packaging and flavors introduced in  produce dips  and frozen breads and rolls 
the segment s sales for and benefited from incremental sales totaling approximately million in each year attributable to a december acquisition 
the level of foodservice sales in and benefited from the growth in several frozen products  with sales also reflecting the influence of the acquisition 
the specialty foods segment operating income in totaled million  a increase from the total of million 
the level was above the level of million 
in  the benefits from the higher sales volumes  a more favorable sales mix and relatively stable ingredient costs were somewhat offset by higher freight and energy costs 
the increase in s operating income was influenced by higher sales volume and modestly lower raw material costs incurred during the year  although the segment also experienced increased freight and promotional costs during this period 
entering  we currently anticipate that certain key commodity costs may become somewhat unfavorable in the first half of the year 
results for may also be influenced by the start up of the segment s new sauce and dressing production facility located in kentucky 
segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment are comprised primarily of candles and related accessories 
segment sales during totaled million and decreased compared to net sales of million 
this decrease was largely attributable to lower candle sales resulting from generally soft market demand and competitive market conditions 
overall sales of glassware also declined 
compared to net sales in totaling million  sales increased by 
candle sales in grew primarily due to greater demand from existing customers  including placement in additional stores for which product 
table of contents was not previously provided 
glassware sales declined on weakness in demand for household drinkware and tableware 
the segment s operating income totaled million during  down from the prior year total of million 
operating results in were adversely affected by the planned temporary idling of most production activities during much of the third quarter at our sapulpa  oklahoma glassware manufacturing facility 
this idling was implemented to better balance existing inventory levels with anticipated demand 
in addition to the impact of the planned idling  lower candle production levels and a trend of progressively higher paraffin wax costs have also negatively impacted margins 
these negatives were offset somewhat by benefits from better production efficiencies at our oklahoma facility prior to the idling 
compared to operating income of million  income decreased by 
the operating income included a noncash impairment charge of million relating to the impairment of certain glassware manufacturing equipment 
also affecting fluctuations between years was income associated with the liquidations of lifo glassware inventory acquired at substantially lower costs in prior years 
such liquidations reduced cost of sales by an insignificant amount in  million in and million in other factors influencing results relative to were the benefits of higher levels of sales and plant utilization  as mitigated by issues of higher material and energy costs 
future results will be sensitive to capacity utilization rates due to the high level of fixed manufacturing costs that exist in this segment 
future results in this segment may also be affected by the consequences of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives  including possible divestitures  with respect to our nonfood operations as announced in april we monitor our operations for indicators of impairment 
to the extent such indicators are present  we evaluate the long lived assets for recoverability 
see further discussion in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
segment review automotive net sales of the automotive segment during totaled million  a increase from the prior year sales level of million 
improved sales of aluminum accessories drove the growth in this segment during a large  new original equipment manufacturer oem program involving aluminum tube steps began in the first quarter of and continued to ramp up through the remainder of the year 
sales in decreased from the sales level of million achieved in our sales of aluminum accessories increased  primarily with oems  but those gains were not large enough to offset a decline in floor mat sales to oems 
floor mat sales were adversely affected by certain oem programs that ended in the first half of this segment s sales to oems are made both directly to the oems and  to a lesser extent  indirectly through third party tier suppliers 
such sales are sensitive to the overall rate of new vehicle sales  the availability of competitive alternatives and the tier suppliers ongoing ability to maintain their relationship with the oems 
additionally  the extent of pricing flexibility associated with these sales continues to be particularly limited with certain products subject to annual price reductions 
during  direct and indirect sales to oems comprised approximately of this segment s sales compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
operating income of the automotive segment totaled million for  substantially lower than the prior year total of million 
the segment incurred start up costs associated with the new oem program involving aluminum tube steps that started in the first quarter 
in addition  higher raw material costs  such as for aluminum  resins and carpet contributed to the decline 
floor mat operations experienced inefficiencies associated with new product launches  lower production levels of rubber floor mats and a less favorable sales mix 
while the results included a noncash impairment charge of million related to certain idle manufacturing equipment  they also were inclusive of a million gain that resulted from the sale of idle real estate 
also affecting results was a charge of approximately million related to the partial settlement of pension obligations 
compared to operating income of million  income decreased by 
the decrease was primarily attributable to higher material costs 
the operating income included a million restructuring charge related to the impairment of certain idle manufacturing equipment 
in  a million restructuring charge was recorded for the closure of the waycross  georgia floor mat facility  with additional related costs of million being recorded in the charges in related to this closure have been insignificant 

table of contents future results in this segment may also be affected by the consequences of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives  including possible divestitures  with respect to our nonfood operations as announced in april liquidity and capital resources the strength of our balance sheet at june  is reflected by the presence of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with million in shareholders equity and no debt 
we believe that this financial position provides us with substantial flexibility to consider business acquisitions  especially those that are complementary in function to that of our existing operations  evaluate share repurchase opportunities and otherwise meet ongoing liquidity requirements 
we maintain an unsecured revolving credit arrangement with several commercial banks totaling million 
terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
we also have an uncommitted line of credit for short term borrowings from one bank for million 
we did not have any borrowings under either arrangement in the three years ending june  we believe that internally generated funds  the existing credit facilities and an ability to obtain additional financing  combined with the current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 
cash flows year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
provided by operating activities used in investing activities used in financing activities our cash flows for the years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided from operating activities in totaled million  a decrease of as compared with the prior year total of million  which was flat  as compared to the total of million 
the decrease resulted mainly from the decline in net income  increased pension payments and relative changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities during included capital expenditures totaling million  compared to million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures primarily reflects the construction of a new salad dressing facility 
it is anticipated that the new facility will become operational late in the first quarter of the increase in capital expenditures is offset somewhat by the relative change in net short term investments 
capital spending allocations during by segment approximated for specialty foods  for glassware and candles and for automotive 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for could exceed million  as we are planning the construction of a new frozen roll manufacturing facility to complement our existing operations 
during  we acquired a food related business for a final purchase price of approximately million 
a net asset adjustment of  was paid in october financing activities used net cash totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to increased dividend payments and increased share repurchases 
total dividends paid during increased approximately million as compared to the prior year period due mainly to the payment of a special cash dividend of per common share in the second quarter 
the total payment for cash dividends for the year ended june  was million 
this amount includes the regular dividend payments of 
per common share for the first quarter and 
per common share for the second  third and fourth quarters and the second quarter special cash dividend of per common share 
excluding the special dividend  the dividend payout rate for was per share as compared to

our board approved share repurchase authorizations of  shares each in may and approximately  shares from these authorizations remained authorized for future purchase at june  on february   pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  we purchased  shares of common stock from the estate of dorothy b 
fox the estate at a price per share of  which was equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the eight trading days beginning february  robert l 
fox  one of our directors  serves as executor of the estate 
previously  on march   pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  we had also purchased  shares of common stock from the estate at a price per share of  which was equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the ten trading days beginning february   as adjusted to reflect the effects of our previously declared dividend 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
except as discussed above  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
we have various contractual obligations  which are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum required pension contributions other long term liabilities as reflected on consolidated balance sheet total operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients  supplies  raw materials  and property  plant and equipment 
this amount does not include million of other noncurrent liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  which consist of the minimum pension liability  other post employment benefit obligations  and deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation 
these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation other than for food commodities  our raw material costs during were generally above levels  which had also increased from costs present during among raw materials most affected by these increases were certain metals  petroleum derived materials and natural gas 
material cost increases especially affected the results of the automotive segment 
in  food commodity costs  particularly for soybean oil and dairy related products  were somewhat lower than levels 
as we begin  certain key food commodity costs may become somewhat unfavorable in the first half of the year  with many other nonfood raw material and freight costs exceeding those of a year ago 
we generally attempt to adjust our selling prices to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments have historically been difficult to implement 
if implemented  such adjustments tend to lag the increase in costs incurred 
minimizing the exposure to such increased costs is our diversity of operations and our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this form k  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize net sales and related cost of sales at the time of shipment of the products  or at the time when all substantial risks of ownership change  if later 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 

table of contents long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether or not indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually through asset impairment assessments as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
this evaluation is based on consideration of expected future undiscounted cash flows and other operating factors 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
the valuation during interim periods of inventories determined under the lifo method of accounting requires estimations regarding the year end mix of inventory quantities and costs of product 
such estimates may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer demand and production schedules 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
these assumptions follow the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on 
table of contents an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes and is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that fin will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  we adopted fin as of june  and noted no material impact on our financial position or results of operations as a result of the adoption 
recently adopted accounting standards effective july   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method  which requires the measurement and recognition of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
prior to sfas r  our stock based compensation plan was accounted for under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
under this guidance  because the exercise price of the stock options was at least equal to the market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized in the financial statements 
under the modified prospective method  we have not restated any prior period balance sheet or income statement items 
pro forma disclosure for these periods can be seen in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements for the year ended june  was approximately million 
this amount was reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses and has been allocated to each segment appropriately 
there was no tax benefit recorded for this compensation cost because it related to incentive stock options that do not qualify for a tax deduction until  and only if  a disqualifying disposition occurs 
at june   there was less than million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the key employee stock option plan 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents have been maintained only with maturities of days or less 
our short term investments have interest reset periods of days or less 
these financial instruments may be subject to interest rate risk through lost income should interest rates increase during their limited term to maturity or resetting of interest rates 
as of june   there was no long term debt outstanding 
future borrowings  if any  would bear interest at negotiated rates and would be subject to interest rate risk 
we do not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial position
