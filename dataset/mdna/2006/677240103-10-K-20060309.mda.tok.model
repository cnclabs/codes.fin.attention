item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation ohio casualty corporation the corporation is the holding company of the ohio casualty insurance company the company  which is one of six property casualty insurance companies that make up the ohio casualty group the group  collectively the consolidated corporation 
all dollar amounts in this management s discussion and analysis md a are in millions unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion of financial condition and results of operation highlights significant factors influencing the results and financial position of the consolidated corporation 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of the results of operations and financial position 
executive level overview the consolidated corporation earns revenue by providing businesses and consumers with competitive insurance products with high quality service and by income on funds invested 
in  the consolidated corporation continued to see improvement in financial performance as net income increased to in from in our capital structure continued to improve during the year as a result of the corporation s elimination of the convertible notes through repurchase  redemption or conversion  with minimal dilution to earnings per share 
during  the board of directors reinstated the quarterly shareholder dividend and approved a share repurchase program of up to four million shares of the corporation s common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
in addition  the combined ratio was the best in decades 
from a profitability perspective  the all lines gaap combined ratio improved to compared to in as all component ratios saw improvements over last year resulting from our improved risk profile and disciplined underwriting 
the group experienced favorable prior year reserve development in and catastrophe losses decreased in over prior year despite the significant hurricanes that devastated the gulf coast 
from a premium perspective  both gross and net premiums declined from prior year as a result of declines in new business premium production due to increased price competition in the market while renewal rates increased only slightly over the group has begun several initiatives to reverse the trend in the decline in premiums including leveraging the advantage of our paris sm technology  restructuring our marketing approach  and investing in new product opportunities 
in september  the consolidated corporation announced its corporate strategic plan for the time frame 
the plan brings together five broad objectives to help achieve the consolidated corporation s vision to be a leading super regional property and casualty carrier providing a broad range of products services through independent agents and brokers 
the broad objectives include abilities to generate above market growth  produce competitive loss ratios  create a competitive expense structure  achieve a competitive return on equity and improve credit ratings and financial flexibility 
competitive advantages include strong agency relationships  especially with key agents  and technology platforms that provide operating flexibility 
technology is being leveraged to make it easier for agents to do business with the group and to increase pricing and underwriting sophistication 
the consolidated corporation continues to execute against this plan and the results in and are an indication that the plan and its execution are working 
the key financial indicators management utilizes consist of gaap combined ratios and component ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis  gross and net written premium growth  impact of prior year reserve development  impact of catastrophes  renewal price increases and investment income growth 
results of operations net income the consolidated corporation reported net income of  or per share  for  compared with  or per share  for the year  and  or per share  in  which included after tax realized investment gains of  per share   per share and  per share for  and  respectively 
item continued december net income after tax net realized gains cumulative effect of accounting change net income per share diluted after tax net realized gains per share diluted cumulative effect of accounting change per share diluted weighted average shares outstanding diluted    the consolidated corporation adopted the emerging issues task force eitf consensus the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share in december see item  note earnings per share in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of the annual report on form k 
financial results continued to show improvements during resulting from improvements in both loss and lae ratios as a result of favorable claim frequency  adequate pricing  favorable prior year reserve development and lower catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses decreased in  even though the industry experienced its worst ever year for natural catastrophes 
underwriting expenses decreased during the year as expense savings resulting from the cost structure efficiency cse initiative are becoming realized 
the year also benefited from a favorable internal revenue service irs settlement adjustment and an accrual reversal for the exit of the new jersey private passenger auto business 
offsetting some of the favorable items mentioned above was related to loss on retirement of the convertible debt incurred in connection with the call redemption of the convertible notes 
for additional information on these transactions  see item  note income taxes on page  note other contingencies and commitments on pages and note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  on pages and of this annual report on form k 
the improved financial results for compared to were driven by significantly improved loss experience  including lower lae  a result of cost reduction programs that have been implemented 
the improved loss and lae ratios are the result of disciplined underwriting and improved pricing methodologies  reduced claim frequency  a decline in large losses losses greater than  per loss and favorable prior years reserve development 
during  underwriting and lae were impacted by increased severance and other related costs  primarily associated with the cse initiative and expenses related to the proformance transaction 
as previously discussed  in  ocnj entered into a transaction which effectively exited the group from the new jersey private passenger auto market 
for additional information regarding this transaction  see item  note other contingencies and commitments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages of this annual report on form k 
investment results consolidated before tax net investment income for the three years ended december   and was after tax  after tax and after tax  respectively 
the effective tax rate on investment income for the three years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
before tax investment income for was slightly higher than the same period of as the impact of growth in the investment portfolio resulting from positive operating cash flows was partially offset by lower before tax investment yields on new investments and the consolidated corporation s increased tax exempt security portfolio 
investments in tax exempt securities increased from at december  to approximately billion at december  additionally  before tax investment income was favorably impacted in by of interest income received from the irs as a result of a favorable tax settlement 
this favorable impact was somewhat offset by a reduction in investment income as a result of the reduction in cash equivalent holdings which were used during to fund the call redemption of the corporation s convertible notes 
as a result of the strategy to invest more heavily into tax exempt securities  the effective tax rate on investment income was reduced to thereby generating an increase in after tax investment income 
in addition to the change in investment strategy and the increase in invested assets described above  which were also applicable to  the decrease in consolidated before tax net investment income compared to is a result of increased investment expenses due to outside management fees  the allocation item continued of interest income pertaining to investments held in a reinsurance treaty fund and significantly lower reinvestment rates than on maturing securities  offset by a favorable amortization adjustment in on certain fixed income securities 
consolidated before tax realized net investment gains amounted to  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
included in the consolidated before tax realized net investment gains was of net gains in the sale of common stocks which were the result of a portfolio reallocation strategy implemented by the consolidated corporation whereby equity holdings in certain common stocks that had appreciated in value over time and had become a significant percentage of the consolidated corporation s common stock portfolio were reduced 
in all periods presented there were no material losses on the disposal of any specific security or in any specific sector 
in the first quarter of  management transferred a portion of its fixed income securities from the available for sale classification into the held to maturity classification 
this transfer was made as the consolidated corporation has both the ability to hold the securities to maturity and the positive intent to do so 
at december  and the amortized cost of the held to maturity portfolio was and  respectively 
invested assets comprise a majority of the consolidated assets 
consequently  accounting policies related to investments are critical 
see further discussion of important investment accounting policies in the critical accounting policies section of this md a and in item  notes to consolidated financial statements  note c  investments  on page of this annual report on form k 
the assessment of whether a decline in fair value is considered temporary or other than temporary includes management s judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity issuing the security 
it is not possible to accurately predict when it may be determined that a specific security will become impaired 
future impairment charges could be material to the results of operations 
the amount of the before tax other than temporary impairment charge recorded was  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
this impairment charge represents less than of the market value of the investment portfolio at december   and  respectively 
the impairment charges relate to companies in various industries 
included in both the and impairment charges were and  respectively  related to fixed income securities issued by companies in the airline industry 
the following tables summarize for all available for sale and held to maturity securities  the total gross unrealized losses  excluding securities with gross unrealized gains  by investment category and length of time the securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of december  and december  available for sale securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities us government states  municipalities and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities government other total fixed income securities   equity securities total temporarily impaired securities   item continued held to maturity securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total temporarily impaired securities available for sale securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities states  municipalities and political subdivisions corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total fixed income securities equity securities cash and cash equivalents total temporarily impaired securities held to maturity securities with unrealized losses less than months months or longer total unrealized unrealized unrealized fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses securities corporate securities mortgage backed securities other total temporarily impaired securities management believes that it will recover the cost basis in the securities held with unrealized losses as it has both the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
as part of its evaluation of the aggregate unrealized loss on securities in the investment portfolio at december   management performed a more intensive review of securities with a higher unrealized loss percentage when compared with their cost or amortized cost 
based on this review of each security  management believes that unrealized losses on these securities were temporary declines in value at december  in the table above  there are approximately securities represented 
of this total  securities have unrealized loss positions greater than of their market values at december   with none item continued exceeding 
this group represents  or of the total unrealized loss position 
of this group  six securities representing approximately in unrealized losses have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
of the remaining five securities in an unrealized loss position for longer than twelve months totaling  management believes they will recover the cost basis of these securities  and has both the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
all securities are monitored by portfolio managers who consider many factors such as an issuer s degree of financial flexibility  management competence and industry fundamentals in evaluating whether the decline in fair value is temporary 
in addition  management considers whether it is probable that all contract terms of the security will be satisfied and whether the unrealized loss position is due to changes in the interest rate environment 
should management subsequently conclude the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the book value of the security is written down to the then fair value with the realized loss recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed income securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity with an unrealized loss position at december   by contractual maturity  are shown below

in  the before tax amortization and impairment costs related to this asset were compared with in and in at december   the largest individual agent asset carrying value was  which represents the maximum future impairment charge for an individual agent  compared to at december  based upon historical performance of this agent  it is unlikely the agent will become impaired or cancelled in the near term 
for the approximately individual agents remaining that represent the total agent relationships intangible asset  the average asset carrying value as of december   was which compares to approximately agents with an average asset carrying value of at december  internally developed software paris sm  an internally developed software application for policy administration  rating and issuance  was introduced into production in the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage  primarily relating to payroll and payroll related costs for employees  along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
the group ceases capitalization when the development effort is substantially complete and rollout begins 
rollout begins when the application has been placed into service for one or more states for an individual major product line and ends when the application is placed into service for the final state 
the rollout period can exceed one year for an individual item continued major product line 
the group began capitalizing application development costs associated with the personal lines segment during  which is expected to begin rollout in in december  the group began rollout for the specialty lines segment 
the specialty lines segment rollout is expected to continue throughout the first half of during  the group substantially completed the rollout for the commercial lines operating segment 
the cost associated with this application is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years from the date placed into service with before tax amortization expense of  and for  and  respectively being reflected in the consolidated statements of income for these respective periods

all lines discussion operating results insurance industry regulators require the group to report its financial condition and results of operations  among other things  using statutory accounting principles 
management uses industry standard financial measures determined on a statutory basis  as well as those determined on a gaap basis to analyze the group s property and casualty operations 
these insurance industry financial measures include loss and lae ratios  underwriting expense ratio  combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is a commonly used gauge of underwriting performance measuring the percentage of premium dollars used to pay insurance losses and related expenses 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss  lae and underwriting expense ratios 
all references to combined ratio or its components in this md a are calculated on a gaap basis  unless otherwise indicated  and are calculated on a calendar year basis unless specified as calculated on an accident year basis 
insurance industry financial measures are included in the next several sections of this md a that discuss results of operations 
a discussion of the differences between statutory accounting and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states is included in item  note  statutory accounting information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on page of this annual report on form k 
insurance industry financial measures are included in the next several sections of this md a that discuss results of operations 
statutory surplus  a financial measure that is required by insurance regulators and used to monitor financial strength  is discussed in the statutory surplus section of the liquidity and capital resources section on pages and of this md a 
premium revenue gross premiums written differs from net premiums written by the amount of premiums ceded to reinsurers 
management analyzes premium revenues primarily by premiums written in the current period  which is a better indicator of current production levels 
net premiums written are recognized into revenue on a monthly pro rata basis over the coverage term of the policy which is reflected in the consolidated income statements as earned premium 
the table below summarizes property and casualty premiums on a gross and net basis for the year ended december  compared with the same period of and  respectively item continued chg chg december  vs

gross premiums written commercial lines specialty lines personal lines all lines    chg chg december  vs 
vs 
net premiums written commercial lines specialty lines personal lines all lines    all lines gross premiums written declined in when compared with the prior year due primarily to all three operating segments experiencing declines in new business premium production as a result of an increase in price competition  partially offset by slightly better retention rates 
all lines net premiums written declined slightly when compared with the prior year with both the commercial and personal lines operating segments experiencing declines  offset almost entirely by an increase in the specialty lines operating segment 
the slight declines in net premiums written is the result of the reasons cited above partially offset by lower ceded premiums resulting from higher retention limits in our reinsurance program when compared with the program 
all lines gross and net premiums written increased slightly in over as a result of improved retention rates and price increases in the group s business is geographically concentrated in the mid west and mid atlantic regions 
the following table shows consolidated net premiums written for the group s five largest states for each of the last three years all lines net premiums written distributed by top states new jersey pennsylvania kentucky ohio maryland new jersey remains the group s largest state  with of the total net premiums written during  even after the group ceased writing in the new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella markets in early the group continues to underwrite other product lines in the new jersey market 
commercial lines gross and net premiums written decreased in  a result of an decline in new business premium production partially offset by improved retention rates and average renewal price increases in the low single digits 
while average renewal price increases  including exposure changes  remained positive in  the rate of increase has slowed as the commercial lines segment approaches price adequacy and competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace have increased 
the average renewal price increase was for commercial lines direct premiums written  compared with and average renewal price increases in and  respectively 
commercial lines gross and net premiums written increased in relative to  a result of average renewal price increases as new business premium production remained relatively flat in when used in this annual report on form k  renewal price increase means the average increase in premium for policies renewed by the group 
the average increase in premiums for each renewed policy is calculated by comparing the total expiring premium for the policy with the total renewal premium for the same policy 
renewal price increases include  among other things  the effects of rate increases and changes in the underlying insured exposures of the policy 
only policies issued by the group in the previous policy term with the same policy identification codes are included 
therefore  renewal price increases do not include changes in premiums for newly issued policies and business assumed through reinsurance agreements 
renewal price increases also do not reflect the cost of any reinsurance purchased on the policies issued 
item continued specialty lines gross premiums written decreased in  a result of significantly lower new business premium production in the commercial umbrella product line partially offset by growth in the fidelity and surety product line 
net premiums written for this segment increased in as a result of a decline in ceded premiums primarily related to higher reinsurance retention limits and an increased accrual in for ceded premium of on a commercial umbrella product line reinsurance treaty for the years through  which reduced net premiums written in without the effect of this additional ceded premium accrual in  specialty lines net premiums written for would have increased by 
gross and net premiums written declined in relative to  a result of lower new business premium production  the ceded premium accrual referenced above and higher reinsurance costs for the commercial umbrella product line 
renewal pricing in the commercial umbrella product line has increased during  and  but the rate of increase has slowed 
average renewal price increases for the commercial umbrella product line were  compared to in and in stricter underwriting guidelines for certain classes of business and market prices falling below what the group believes are acceptable levels  contributed to the decline in new business production for the commercial umbrella product line 
personal lines gross and net premiums written declined during as a result of a decline in new business premium production when compared with the prior year 
additionally  in the later part of  the group began taking rate reductions in a number of states for both the personal auto and homeowners product lines 
all of these factors are either the result of or in response to increased competition  and as it relates to rate reduction  the achievement of significant levels of profitability in personal lines 
gross premiums written remained relatively flat during and net premiums written increased slightly 
both gross and net premiums written were negatively impacted in due to a refund of escrowed premiums for north carolina personal auto 
the following table provides key financial measures for all lines for each of the last three years december all lines loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the all lines combined ratio improved points resulting from continued improvement in all three component ratios 
the point improvement in the loss and lae ratios is the result of the group s continued focus on disciplined underwriting quality  lower claim frequency  favorable prior year reserve development of and lower catastrophe losses 
the favorable prior year reserve development reduced the loss and lae ratios by points 
the point improvement in the underwriting expense ratio is primarily a result of the group s continued focus on expense management and the result of expense savings from the cse initiative announced in the all lines combined ratio improved points driven by a point improvement in the loss and lae ratios 
the loss and lae ratios were impacted by favorable prior year reserve development of in compared to adverse reserve development of in  which reduced the loss and lae ratio by points and increased the loss and lae ratio by points 
the remaining improvement of points in the loss and lae ratio over was due to improved price adequacy  more disciplined underwriting standards and improved claims efficiency 
the underwriting expense ratio improved points as a result of operational efficiencies implemented throughout and  somewhat offset by  or points of expense related to the proformance surplus guarantee 
the loss and lae ratio components of the accident year combined ratio measure losses and lae arising from insured events that occurred in the respective accident year 
the current accident year excludes losses and lae for insured events that occurred in prior accident years 
the table below summarizes the impact of changes in provision for all prior accident year losses and lae for each of the last three years item continued net liabilities  beginning of period    decrease increase in provision for prior accident year claims decrease increase in provision for prior accident year claims as of premiums earned during  the before tax favorable development from prior accident years losses and lae  which represented of loss and lae reserves at year end  was concentrated in the specialty lines primarily the commercial umbrella product line and personal lines primarily the personal auto product line operating segments 
this net favorable development was partially offset by adverse development in the commercial lines operating segment due almost entirely to the review of all pension or permanent disability workers compensation cases during the year 
in  the impact of the favorable development for prior accident years losses and lae was concentrated in the commercial and specialty lines operating segments 
in  the specialty lines segment experienced significant favorable development for prior years losses and lae  primarily due to a reduction in estimated future costs for claims adjuster related expenses 
the total provision reduction for prior years losses and lae of before tax represents of loss and lae reserves as of year end during  the group reported adverse development of for prior years losses and lae  representing of loss and lae reserves as of year end this adverse development was concentrated in the commercial and personal lines operating segments 
catastrophe losses in  and were  and  respectively 
hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma made up of the of catastrophe losses in the group was impacted by separate catastrophes in  compared with catastrophes in and in the largest catastrophe  as measured in terms of incurred loss  in each year was  and  respectively 
additional catastrophes with over in incurred losses numbered five  ten and nine in  and  respectively 
the group uses the serial number assigned by property claims services  a unit of the insurance services office  to define and track losses for specific catastrophes 
property claims services defines catastrophes as industry events that cause or more in direct insured losses to property 
the effects of future catastrophes on the consolidated corporation s results cannot be accurately predicted 
as such  severe weather patterns  acts of war or terrorist activities could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated corporation s results  reinsurance pricing and availability of reinsurance 
catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance and their impact on the combined ratio  for each of the last three years were catastrophe losses before tax dollar impact combined ratio impact the seven year historical catastrophe impact on the loss ratio compared to actual impact for all lines of business is as follows loss ratio point impact q q q q annual historical average actual the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned  decreased by points in the underwriting expense ratio was favorably impacted by the group s focus on expense management  including implementation of additional process efficiencies that have continued to allow for reduced staffing levels and by a reduction to the surplus guarantee accrual related to the sale of the group s new jersey private passenger auto business to proformance insurance company item continued proformance 
the employee count continued to decline in with an approximate reduction from as a result of the cse initiative 
the employee count was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
partially offsetting the decline in expenses related to the cse initiative were increased incentive accruals due to improved profitability 
the underwriting expense ratio when compared to was favorably impacted by a reduction in employee related costs  a non recurring reduction in assessments  fees and premium taxes and by other operating efficiencies 
these improvements were partially offset by points of expense related to the proformance surplus guarantee 
the  and underwriting expenses also included  and of software amortization expense before tax  respectively  related to the rollout of paris sm 
on a gaap accounting basis  the new application is being amortized over a ten year period 
the amortization expense is expected to be offset in part by reduced labor costs related to underwriting and policy processing 
in  the group introduced into operation  paris sm for commercial lines and substantially completed the rollout in at the end of  paris sm was deployed for the specialty lines commercial umbrella excess capacity product line 
further implementation for other specialty and personal lines products is expected during the balance of and the paris sm system provides the policy administration environment used internally by the group s associates 
an extension of paris sm called paris express sm leverages the paris sm system to provide underwriting  rating  inquiry and policy processing functionality to our agents 
paris express sm is a proprietary internet interface that uses the paris sm system to provide real time functionality through a web browser to our agents 
in addition  the group is simultaneously introducing paris connect tm which allows agents to transact with the group directly from their agency management system without requiring re entering of customer or agency information 
for selected commercial lines agents  paris express sm and paris connect tm provides on line quoting capability 
in february of  paris express sm was extended to support issuance and endorsement processing for selected pilot agents  nationwide rollout started in december and will extend through march personal lines currently offers on line and real time quoting and issuance for new business and endorsements through existing non paris sm systems 
agents want a cost effective  timely and simple system for issuing and maintaining insurance policies 
paris express sm and paris connect tm are the cornerstone in the group s strategy of focusing on superior agent service 
the continued success of the group s strategic plan depends in part on the ability to provide agents with the technological advantages of these tools 
if they do not work as expected  or fail to satisfy agents needs  the group may lose business to insurers with preferred technologies 
segment discussion the consolidated corporation has three reportable segments commercial  specialty and personal lines 
these reportable segments represent the consolidated corporation s operating segments 
within each operating segment are distinct insurance product lines that generate revenues by selling a variety of commercial  surety and personal insurance products 
the commercial lines operating segment sells commercial multiple peril  commercial auto  general liability and workers compensation insurance as its primary products 
the specialty lines operating segment sells commercial umbrella  excess insurance and fidelity and surety insurance as its primary products

the following segment information is presented on a gaap basis unless otherwise noted 
commercial lines segment commercial lines segment loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the commercial lines combined ratio increased points when compared to results 
the increase in loss and lae ratios of points is primarily related to of adverse prior year reserve development compared to favorable development of in the adverse development in was primarily related to the re evaluation of lifetime case reserves in the workers compensation product line  partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development in the commercial auto product line 
the adverse reserve development was further offset by favorable claim frequency trends 
the underwriting ratio decreased points  primarily the result of staff reductions and operational efficiencies implemented in and the commercial lines combined ratio for the year decreased points due to a significantly lower loss ratio as a result of improved pricing and underwriting quality in addition to favorable development on prior year reserves 
favorable claim frequency trends  driven in part by underwriting actions  and improved pricing helped to offset the commercial lines claim severity trend 
the combined ratio included points of favorable development on loss and lae reserves from prior years  compared to adverse development of points in on loss and lae reserves from prior years 
the decline in the combined ratio also included a point improvement in the underwriting expense ratio primarily as a result of staff reductions and employee benefit changes 
commercial lines results for included a lower level of catastrophe losses which added points to the commercial lines combined ratio in  compared to points and points in and respectively 
item continued the workers compensation product line combined ratio was in  an increase of points compared to in and in the adverse development on the workers compensation product line is related to the completion of a review of lifetime and other severe claims  which added points to the workers compensation combined ratio in also impacting the loss and lae ratios for these periods were assessments for the national workers compensation pool nwcp  which added points to the workers compensation combined ratio in compared to points and points in and  respectively 
the group continues to focus on improving profitability in the workers compensation product line 
the group has restricted writings in states where the workers compensation product line has historically been unprofitable and is focused on growing this product line in profitable states and classes 
the concentration of the group s business in a few states with limited pricing flexibility provides less opportunity to address issues specific to the workers compensation product line in those states 
these issues are offset by the group s approach to writing workers compensation as part of an overall commercial lines account  where underwriters seek to ensure that the pricing for the entire account is adequate 
the general liability product line combined ratio was in  an increase of points compared to in and in this line is exposed to construction defect issues which are being addressed through strict underwriting standards for certain classes of business that are more prone to construction defect claims 
in addition  the group has introduced policy language changes to limit exposure to broadening court interpretations of additional insured and contractual general liability provisions within the policy 
also impacting the general liability product line combined ratio is an increase in asbestos and environmental loss and lae reserves which added points to the general liability loss and lae ratio related to certain pre assumed reinsurance 
specialty lines segment specialty lines segment loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio specialty lines combined ratio for improved points 
given the volume and nature of the coverage  the specialty lines combined ratio is subject to more volatility than the other product lines 
the combined ratio included  or points  of favorable development on prior year loss and lae reserves compared to  or points  in and  or points  in the fidelity and surety combined ratio increased to in  compared with in and in the fidelity and surety combined ratio included of favorable development on prior accident year loss and lae reserves compared to in and in the commercial umbrella combined ratio was compared to and in and  respectively 
the combined ratio included points of favorable development on prior year loss and lae reserves compared to points and points in and  respectively 
also impacting the comparison of to is the reinstatement accrual in  which reduced net premium written and earned  putting upward pressure on the combined and component ratios in personal lines segment personal lines segment loss ratio loss adjustment expense ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the personal lines combined ratio for decreased points over the same period last year  as all components of the combined ratio saw improvements 
the loss and lae ratios improved points over resulting from lower catastrophe losses  favorable development on prior years reserves and favorable claim frequency trends 
the loss ratio included points related to catastrophe losses verses points and item continued points in and  respectively 
favorable prior years reserve development was or points in  compared to adverse development of or points and or points in and  respectively 
the underwriting expense ratio improved points  which included a point reduction related to the proformance surplus guarantee  compared to a point increase in critical accounting policies management of the consolidated corporation has identified the policies listed below as significant accounting policies that are critical to the consolidated corporation s business operations and influence the consolidated results of operations and financial performance 
the policies listed below were selected as they require a higher degree of complexity or use subjective judgments or assessments 
changes in these judgments  assessments or estimates could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated corporation s financial statements 
these policies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
a summary of each critical accounting policy follows 
management discusses the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the consolidated corporation s md a 
for a complete discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see item  note  summary of significant accounting changes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on pages of this annual report on form k 
investments all investment securities are classified upon acquisition as either held to maturity or available for sale 
fixed income securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost as management has the ability and positive intent to hold the securities until maturity 
available for sale securities are those securities that are not classified as either held to maturity or trading 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred tax 
transfers of fixed income securities into the held to maturity category from the available for sale category are made at fair value at the date of transfer 
the unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer is retained in other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held to maturity securities 
such amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the security 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values and include non redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks 
the difference between cost and quoted market value  net of deferred taxes  is classified as other comprehensive income 
the consolidated corporation closely monitors the fixed income and equity portfolios for declines in value that are deemed to be other than temporary 
investments are regularly evaluated based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other specific developments 
if a decline in a security s fair value is considered to be other than temporary  the security is written down to the estimated fair value with a corresponding realized loss recognized in the then current consolidated statement of income 
mortgage backed securities are amortized over a period based on estimated future principal payments  including prepayments 
prepayment assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect actual prepayments and changes in expectations 
upon receipt of payments from such securities  the appropriate amount of the funds are allocated between a reduction of principal and interest income 
in making this allocation decision  investment personnel consider such factors as the original estimated average life of the investment  the amount of funds received to date and the timing of future cash flows 
variations from prepayment assumptions will affect the life and yield of these securities 
these securities are evaluated for impairment by computing the net present value of expected future cash flows and comparing this to the prior period estimate of expected future cash flows from the security 
when the timing and or amount of cash expected to be received from the security has changed materially and adversely from the previous valuation  the security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated fair value with a realized loss recorded in the then current consolidated statement of income 
reinsurance reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer  called a reinsurer  agrees to cover  under certain defined circumstances  a portion of the losses incurred by a primary insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the primary insurer 
the group purchases reinsurance to diversify risk and reduce the loss that may arise from large or catastrophic losses or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results 
the group records its ceded reinsurance transactions on a gross basis by recording an asset as reinsurance recoverable for estimates of paid and unpaid losses  including estimates for losses incurred but not reported 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group evaluates each reinsurer s financial health  claims settlement performance and monitors concentrations of item continued credit risk to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are reviewed and those that are determined by the group to have insufficient financial strength are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large number of reinsurers are utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
to the extent that any reinsuring companies are unable to meet obligations under the ceded reinsurance agreements  the group would remain liable to the policyholder 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are calculated in a manner consistent with the reinsurance contract and are reported net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts  as deemed necessary 
at december  and  no reinsurer accounted for more than percent of the reinsurance recoverable amount 
as a result of these controls  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
there are several programs that provide reinsurance coverage and the programs in effect for are discussed in the reinsurance programs section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  on page of this annual report on form k 
additionally  reinsurance is further discussed in item  note k  summary of significant accounting policies on page and note  reinsurance  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
agent relationships the agent relationships asset is an identifiable intangible asset representing the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the gai commercial lines acquisition 
this purchase price was allocated to specifically identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated values as determined by appropriate valuation models 
the agent relationships asset is amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of twenty five years 
the estimated useful life was based on the group s actual experience for agency appointment terms for similar agents  which averaged approximately twenty five years in length 
the estimated useful life is evaluated on an annual basis or as events or circumstances arise that may impact the useful life of the asset 
the asset is evaluated quarterly as events or circumstances  such as cancellation of agents  indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
cancellation of certain agents for reasons such as lack of revenue production or poor quality of business produced does not necessarily change the estimated useful life of the remaining agents representing the agent relationships intangible asset 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on existing company businesses 
the analyses involve significant management judgments to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
if future undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in income in the period in which the future cash flows are identified to be insufficient in comparison to the carrying amount of the asset 
due to the inherent uncertainties and judgments involved in developing assumptions for each agent  further reductions in the valuation of the agent relationships asset are likely to occur in the future 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan and a contributory postretirement healthcare plan 
the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  related costs and contributions are calculated using actuarial methods in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pension 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
the company considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns  interest rates and inflation in making these assumptions 
any adjustments to these assumptions are based on considerations of current and future market conditions  which can result in changes to the future related benefit obligations  related costs and contributions incurred by the company 
management reviews the assumptions used in the valuations on an annual basis  or more frequently as deemed necessary 
the company determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on the geometric method  which represents the average compound return of the plan assets 
plan assets are comprised primarily of investments in mutual funds  common stocks  corporate bonds  us government securities  real estate investment trusts and other investments 
the company considers the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes  current and expected asset allocation and the expectations for future returns of each asset class item continued when developing the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of the assumption for  and the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase  respectively  net periodic pension expense by approximately in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes current market information including analysis of the moody s aa corporate bond index rate  analysis provided by plan actuaries and independent survey data on similarly positioned companies 
as regards to the analysis provided by plan actuaries  a discounted cash flow model of the plan s benefit obligations was developed using an interest rate yield curve to make judgments regarding the appropriate discount rate for both its pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations 
the yield curve is comprised of the highest quartile yielding bonds with at least an aa rating and with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years 
this resulted in the selection of for  for and for for the pension plan and for  for and for for the postretirement medical plan 
unrecognized losses of approximately  as of the measurement date september   are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the average future service period of active participants 
unrecognized gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized losses will be systematically recognized as an increase in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with sfas the company contributed in the first quarter of and is currently evaluating whether any further contributions will be made in the source for the funding will be cash flow from operating activities 
key assumptions used in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under sfas  including the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs  are reviewed by management on an annual basis  or more frequently as deemed necessary 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
the company assumes that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was declining to in and thereafter 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   by approximately and increase the postretirement benefit cost for by likewise  decreasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   by approximately and decrease the postretirement benefit cost for by the actuarial assumptions used by the company in determining its pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
in  the company announced changes to its defined benefit retirement plan and defined postretirement health care plans 
the company s traditional defined benefit retirement plan was amended to freeze accrued benefits effective june   and to incorporate a new benefit formula beginning july as a result of this change in the defined benefit retirement plan  the company recognized a reduction in net periodic pension cost of and in and  respectively  attributable to the amortization of unrecognized prior service cost and has a remaining unrecognized prior service cost of at december  which will be ratably recognized over the next years as a reduction of net periodic pension cost 
also effective in july  eligibility for subsidized retiree medical and dental coverage was restricted to then current retirees and employees with or more years of continuous service 
other employees are eligible for access to unsubsidized retiree medical and dental coverage 
as a result of this change in the defined postretirement item continued benefit plan  the company recognized a reduction in net periodic postretirement cost of and in and  respectively  attributable to the amortization of unrecognized prior service cost and has a remaining unrecognized prior service cost of at december   which will be ratably recognized over the next eight years as a reduction of net periodic postretirement cost

reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses the group s largest liabilities are reserves for losses and lae 
loss and lae reserves collectively loss reserves are established for all incurred claims without discounting for the time value of money 
before credit for reinsurance recoverables  these reserves amounted to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
as of december   the loss reserves by operating segment were as follows  commercial lines  specialty lines and personal lines 
the group purchases reinsurance to mitigate the impact of large losses and catastrophic events 
loss reserves ceded to reinsurers amounted to and at december  and  respectively 
the group conducts a quarterly review of loss reserves using the methods described below  and records its best estimate each quarter based on that review 
in the opinion of management  the reserves recorded at december  represent the group s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and lae 
however  due to the inherent complexity of the estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  final claim settlements may vary significantly from the amounts recorded 
furthermore  the timing  frequency and extent of adjustments to the estimated liabilities cannot be predicted with certainty since conditions and events which established historical loss reserve development and which serve as the basis for estimating ultimate claim costs may not occur in exactly the same manner  if at all 
loss reserves are an estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and lae for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent estimates  generally utilizing actuarial expertise and reserving methods  at a given accounting date 
these loss reserve estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future  based on the group s assessment of facts and circumstances then known 
in establishing reserves  the group also takes into account estimated recoveries for reinsurance  salvage and subrogation 
the process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of risk factors 
these risk factors can be related to both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes  among others 
the impact of these items on ultimate costs for loss and lae is difficult to estimate 
loss reserve estimation differs by product line due to differences in claim complexity  the volume of claims  the potential severity of individual claims  the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags the time between the occurrence of the policyholder loss event and when it is actually reported to the insurer 
informed judgment is applied throughout the process 
the group continually refines its loss reserve estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the group considers all significant facts and circumstances known at the time loss reserves are established 
due to the inherent uncertainty underlying loss reserve estimates  final resolution of the estimated liability will be different from that anticipated at the reporting date 
therefore  actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than currently reserved favorable or unfavorable 
the group reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed 
the following table displays case  ibnr and lae reserves by product line both gross and net of reinsurance recoverables 
case reserves represent amounts determined for each claim based on the known facts regarding the claim and the parameters of the coverage that our policy provides 
the ibnr reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims  provisions for losses in excess of the case reserves on previously reported claims  claims to be reopened and a provision for uncertainty in recognition of the variability and risk factors described below 
the ibnr provision also includes an offset for anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
lae reserves are an estimate of the expenses related to resolving and settling claims 
reserves ceded to reinsurers and reserves net of reinsurance are also shown 
item continued loss and lae reserves as of december  and gross total total year operating segment case ibnr lae total ceded net commercial lines   workers compensation commercial auto general liability cmp  fire inland marine specialty lines commercial umbrella fidelity surety personal lines personal auto umbrella personal property total all lines     commercial lines   workers compensation commercial auto general liability cmp  fire inland marine specialty lines commercial umbrella fidelity surety personal lines personal auto umbrella personal property total all lines    reserve estimation methods most of our insurance policies are written on an occurrence basis which provides coverage if a loss occurs in the policy period  even if the insured reports the loss many years later 
in addition  final settlement of certain claims can be delayed for years or decades due to litigation or other reasons 
for example  some general liability claims are reported years or more after the policy period  and the workers compensation coverage provided by our policies pays unlimited medical benefits for the duration of the claimant s injury up to the lifetime of the claimant 
occurrence based forms of insurance require estimation of future costs  including the effect of judicial interpretations  societal litigation trends and medical cost inflation  among others 
reserve development can occur over time as conditions and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance 
product lines are generally classified as either long tail or short tail  based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims 
short tail claims are reported and settled quickly  resulting in less estimation variability 
the longer the time before final claim resolution  the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty 
long tail product lines item continued include workers compensation  commercial umbrella and general liability 
short tail lines include homeowners  property and bonds 
product lines such as personal and commercial auto and commercial multi peril include some long tail coverages and some short tail coverages 
a key assumption in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future  absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below 
to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known  such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and  if available and when appropriate  external data 
such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated 
the process for estimating loss reserves begins by assessing risks and exposures 
data on individual reported claims  both current and historical  is collected including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates  and this data is grouped by common characteristics and evaluated in the analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line 
such data is occasionally supplemented with external data such as industry development factors as available and when appropriate 
the process of analyzing reserves is undertaken on a regular basis  generally quarterly  in light of continually updated information 
multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities 
each estimation method has its own advantages and disadvantages  with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
generally more methods are used for long tail product lines because of the difficulty in estimating reserves for these lines 
also  more methods are generally used for recent accident years compared to older accident years because the data available for recent accident years is less mature 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time based on the available facts and circumstances 
therefore  the actual choice of estimation methods can change with each evaluation 
the estimation methods chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated 
the principal actuarial reserving methods utilized by the group to establish loss reserves include  but are not limited to paid loss development payment patterns of prior claims are used to estimate future payment patterns which are applied to current payments to derive an estimate of ultimate losses 
incurred loss development case incurred patterns of prior claims are used to estimate future incurred patterns which are applied to current incurred losses to derive an estimate of ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio loss ratios are determined for recent accident years based on historical accident year loss ratios  recent economic trends and changes in the book of business  including rate levels 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is then applied to the actual earned premiums to calculate ultimate losses 
bornhuetter ferguson estimates blends the expected loss ratio method with either the paid or incurred loss development method using weights based on the maturity of the accident year 
claim count and severity estimates ultimate claim counts and average claim severities are developed separately and then multiplied to derive an estimate of ultimate losses 
for short tail lines  the paid loss and incurred loss development methods are generally relied on for all accident years  and the bornhuetter ferguson method is also relied on for the most recent accident year 
for long tail lines  all of the above methods may be used for the most recent accident years  and as accident years mature  reliance is shifted to the paid and incurred loss development methods 
the merits of each method are evaluated given the facts at hand 
an estimate of the ultimate losses is then made based upon the particular method or combination of methods that is deemed most appropriate 
in some cases the methodologies produce a cluster of estimates with a tight band of indicated possible outcomes 
in other cases  the methodologies produce conflicting results and wider bands of indicated possible outcomes 
management does not believe that such bands constitute a range of outcomes  nor does management determine a range of outcomes 
reserves for losses and allocated lae for asbestos and environmental exposures are especially difficult to determine because of the high amount of legal costs and the extended period of time required to settle these claims 
methods used by the group to estimate these loss reserves include survival ratio estimates  curve fitting applied to both paid and case incurred losses and allocated lae  and frequency and severity estimates 
item continued reserve variability and uncertainty there is a great deal of uncertainty in the loss reserve estimates and unforeseen events can have unfavorable impacts on the loss reserve estimates 
reinsurance is purchased to mitigate the impact of large losses and catastrophic events 
the estimate of reinsurance recoverables is considered a critical accounting estimate and discussed on pages and of this annual report on form k 
loss reserve uncertainty is illustrated by the variability in reserve development presented in the analysis of development of loss and lae liabilities schedule which appears on pages and under item of this annual report on form k 
this schedule shows cumulative loss reserve development for each of the past ten years through december  on a gross and net of reinsurance basis 
the development on a net of reinsurance basis as a percent of the original estimates ranges from adverse development of of original estimates for loss reserves at year end to favorable development of of original estimates for loss reserves at year end the oldest period shown   shows adverse development of of original loss reserves ten years after the original estimates 
to illustrate the uncertainty by operating segment  the following table provides the before tax amount of prior accident years loss reserve development by operating segment on a net of reinsurance basis for the years ended december   and  respectively operating segment commercial lines specialty lines personal lines total prior accident years development this table illustrates that favorable development can occur for one operating segment while adverse development occurs for another  and that development from year to year can be either favorable or adverse for an operating segment 
within each operating segment  development can also be favorable or adverse by product line within the same period 
for example  for the commercial lines operating segment in  the workers compensation product line had adverse development of while the commercial auto product line had favorable development of reserve estimates are also uncertain by accident period 
to illustrate this  the following table provides the before tax amount of prior accident years loss and lae reserve development by accident year on a net of reinsurance basis for all lines combined accident period accident year accident year accident year accident year accident year prior total prior accident years development this table illustrates that recent accident periods have developed favorably while the older periods have developed adversely 
more than half of the of adverse development for accident years prior in calendar period is attributed to our review of workers compensation permanent cases which is discussed in more detail below 
we do not believe that older accident years will always develop adversely while more recent years develop favorably 
however  it should be understood that the prior accident years category includes claims covering many decades  many of which are complex 
conversely  the recent accident years include a mix of claims of varying degrees of difficulty for which many are relatively straight forward to establish loss reserves 
item continued the group does not prepare loss reserve ranges  nor does it project future variability  when determining its best estimate  although the above examples of actual historical changes in loss reserve estimates provide a measure of the uncertainty underlying the current loss reserve estimates 
the loss reserve process takes all risk factors  as previously disclosed  into account  but no one risk factor has been bifurcated to perform a sensitivity or variability analysis because the risk factors were considered in the aggregate 
as a result  the group is not in a position to quantify the impact of reasonably likely changes to significant assumptions at this time 
nevertheless  the group plans to undertake an assessment to evaluate the sensitivity or variability of changes in significant assumptions related to the group s estimate of loss reserves in the aggregate and or by product line  to the extent material 
upon completion of such sensitivity or variability assessment  and to the extent that management believes the information to be reasonably accurate and credible and would be beneficial  in the opinion of management  to the understanding of the group s financial statements  the corporation will include the outcome of this sensitivity variability analysis either in the aggregate or by product line  as appropriate  in the first practicable periodic filing of the corporation that follows the completion of this assessment and continuing thereafter 
the group has four categories of loss reserves that it considers highly uncertain  and therefore  could have a material impact on future financial results workers compensation  asbestos and environmental liability  construction defect exposures and commercial umbrella 
these categories are described below with relevant historical data 
workers compensation represents the group s largest product line as measured by the magnitude of loss reserves  representing approximately of the total on a net of reinsurance basis 
the coverage provided includes indemnity and medical benefits generally defined by state regulation 
indemnity benefits compensate the injured worker for wage replacement  while the medical benefits generally provide unlimited coverage for a work related accident for the life of the claimant 
many workers compensation claims are small and are settled within a year or two of the accident date 
however  some of the claims are serious  resulting in costs that can extend for decades 
for workers compensation loss reserves net of reinsurance at year end  approximately are related to claims over five years old  and approximately are related to claims over ten years old 
during  in response to industry wide development  the group s claims department reviewed permanent workers compensation cases to re assess life expectancy and medical costs 
the review resulted in increases to loss reserves on approximately of the inventory of approximately  permanent cases 
these adjustments comprise a substantial part of the adverse development for this product line in the group will continue to monitor these types of claims in the future 
in recent years  asbestos and environmental liability claims have expanded greatly in the insurance industry 
historically  the group has written small commercial accounts with a focus on contracting business 
within the manufacturing category  the group has concentrated on light manufacturers  thus the group s exposure to asbestos is related to installers and distributors as opposed to the large manufacturers 
consequently  the group believes it has minimal exposure to the primary defendants involved in major asbestos litigation 
the group s exposure to environmental liability is due to policies written prior to the introduction of the absolute pollution endorsement in the mid s and to underground storage tanks  mostly from new jersey homeowner s policies in recent years 
the group has limited exposures to the national priority list  a list of known or threatened releases of hazardous substances  pollutants  or contaminants throughout the united states 
the group also has limited asbestos and environmental exposures related to assumed reinsurance business written prior to with small policy limits 
in and  respectively  the group paid loss and lae of and for asbestos and environmental claims on a net of reinsurance basis 
at year end and  asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance were and  respectively 
the group defines construction defect exposure as liability for allegations of defective work and completed operations losses from general  commercial multiple peril and umbrella liability policies involving multiple units condos townhouses apartments tracts of single family homes  multiple defendants eg developers  sub contractors  usually with multiple defect issues  and often involving multiple insurance carriers 
loss reserves are difficult to estimate for this exposure because of the complexity of the claims and the late reporting which often occurs many years after the policy term 
the group excludes from this definition claims related to individual single family homes  apartments townhomes or other residential properties if the defect issues are limited in scope and volume 
item continued paid losses for construction defect claims  net of reinsurance  were in  compared to in and in paid claims legal related lae  net of reinsurance  for construction defect claims were in  compared with in and in loss and legal related lae reserves were  and at year end  and  respectively 
these totals exclude construction defect losses from the state of california because the group stopped writing in that state in and the remaining claims are minimal 
the group writes commercial umbrella business with large policy limits 
the period of time between the loss occurrence  the reporting of the claim to the insurer  and the settlement of the claim can extend over many years 
the large policy limits  complexity of claims and the lengthy time period required to reach settlement increase the uncertainty of loss estimates 
reinsurance is purchased to mitigate the impact of these large losses 
for and  commercial umbrella loss reserves prior to reinsurance were and  respectively  while loss reserves net of reinsurance were and  respectively 
loss and lae risk factors the major causes of material uncertainty risk factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one product line 
examples include changes in claim handling practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components 
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases 
for example  estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings  but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors 
the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts 
while some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction  others are more evolutionary 
evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values  with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately  in step wise fashion 
the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred 
sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates  although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact 
evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates  as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable 
loss and lae risk factors by product line the following section details reserving considerations and loss and lae risk factors for the product lines representing most of our loss reserves 
each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required loss reserves 
also  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required loss reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
the group does not make explicit assumptions for the risk factors described below 
o workers compensation workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker s life  such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care 
despite the item continued possibility of long payment tail  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency  moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker s injury 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk 
examples of loss and lae risk factors that can change and  thus  affect the required workers compensation loss reserves include  but are not limited to  the following indemnity claims risk factors time required to recover from the injury degree of available transitional jobs degree of legal involvement changes in the interpretations and processes of the workers compensation commissions oversight of claims future wage inflation for states that index benefits changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds medical claims risk factors changes in the cost of medical treatments including prescription drugs and underlying fee schedules frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used type of medical treatments received use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices availability of new medical processes and equipment changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs degree of patient responsiveness to treatment book of business risk factors injury type mix changes in underwriting standards general workers compensation risk factors frequency of claim re openings on claims previously closed mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment degree of cost shifting between workers compensation and health insurance o general liability general liability is considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions 
there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within to years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims 
in addition  this line includes asbestos and environmental claims which are reviewed separately because of the unique character of the exposures 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid indemnity amounts 
for most of our policies defense costs are outside of policy limits  meaning that amounts paid are in addition to the indemnity limits provided by the policy 
major contributors to loss reserve estimate uncertainty for general liability include the reporting lag ie the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim  the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action  whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods  the potential dollars involved in the individual claim actions  whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written ie  coverage dispute potential and the potential for mass claim actions 
claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk 
item continued examples of loss and lae risk factors that can change and thus affect the required general liability loss reserves include  but are not limited to  the following claims risk factors changes in claim handling procedures changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue  in general and with specificity to particular issues changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law shifts in law suit mix between federal and state courts changes in claim office structure causing distortions in the data changes in settlement patterns book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  jurisdiction mix o commercial umbrella commercial umbrella is considered a long tail line as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
this line has many of the same characteristics and risk factors as the general liability line described above 
additional risk factors for this line are the attachment point and limit provided 
the attachment point is generally at least  and sometimes in excess of  resulting in a greater reporting lag and thus more variability than that of general liability 
the limit provided by commercial umbrella varies from up to the higher limit policies create more variability in loss reserve estimates than general liability policies 
reinsurance is purchased to mitigate this additional uncertainty 
o commercial multi peril commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage and therefore includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the liability coverages it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  and has risk factors similar to general liability described above 
o commercial automobile the commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
the payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage property claims and property damage liability claims 
the payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims 
in general  claim reporting lags are minor  claim complexity is not a major issue and the line is viewed as high frequency  low to moderate severity 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk 
commercial automobile reserves are typically analyzed in three components  bodily injury liability  property damage liability and physical damage claims 
these last two components have minimal loss reserve risk and fast payouts and  accordingly  separate risk factors are not presented 
examples of loss and lae risk factors that can change and  thus  affect the required commercial automobile loss reserves include  but are not limited to  the following item continued claims risk factors trends in jury awards changes in the underlying court system changes in case law litigation trends frequency of claims with payment capped by policy limits change in average severity of accidents  or proportion of severe accidents subrogation opportunities changes in claim handling procedures frequency of visits to health providers number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers types of health providers used types of medical treatments received changes in cost of medical treatments degree of patient responsiveness to treatment book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  etc 
changes in mix of insured vehicles changes in underwriting standards o personal automobile the personal automobile product line has risk factors comparable to the commercial automobile product line described above 
in addition  this line is subject to risk related to the effectiveness of the no fault laws that exist in some states

liquidity and capital resources cash flow net cash generated from operations was in compared with and in and  respectively 
cash generated from operations was essentially flat compared to as a result of a continued decline in paid losses and lae of in  a result of improved loss experience  and received from the settlement of irs examinations which contributed to the improved profitability of the corporation 
see below for additional information on this settlement 
the impact of these items were offset by a decline in net premiums written in and a decrease in reinsurance treaty funds held of the decrease in the reinsurance treaty funds held is related to withdrawals to pay claims qualified under this contract of reinsurance  which was terminated on december  and is in run off 
these withdrawals reduced the reinsurance treaty funds held obligation and reduced net cash flow from operating activities 
in and the group made deposits of premium into the reinsurance treaty fund in excess of withdrawals  therefore increasing this obligation and net cash flow from operating activities 
the increase in net cash for the year compared to is due primarily to a reduction in paid losses and lae of in  as a result of improved loss experience 
the reinsurance recoverable asset at december  and  increased and with and due to increases in loss and lae reserves for future loss payments expected to be paid by reinsurers  offset by a decrease in ceded unearned premium of in along with other components as shown in item  note  reinsurance  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on page of this annual report on form k

during  the consolidated corporation finalized negotiations with the irs regarding its examination of the consolidated corporation s tax years through on august   the irs issued notification to the consolidated corporation that a settlement concerning its examination of these tax years was approved 
this settlement resulted in a net tax benefit related to realized capital gains and interest income  before tax  of in conjunction with the irs settlement  the consolidated corporation reversed related to realized capital gains and related to operations of book tax reserves 
additionally  on september   the irs advised the consolidated corporation that it accepted a protective claim for refund for the tax year related to adjustments resulting from the settlement of the irs examination of the tax year

rating agencies regularly the financial condition of the consolidated corporation and the group is reviewed by four independent rating agencies  a 
m 
best  fitch  moody s and s p 
these agencies assign ratings and rating outlooks reflecting the agencies opinions of the group s financial strength and the ability of the corporation to meet its financial obligations to its debt security holders 
following are the consolidated corporation s current ratings and rating outlooks 
am best fitch moody s s p financial strength rating a a a bbb senior unsecured debt rating bbb bbb baa bb rating outlook stable positive stable positive statutory surplus statutory surplus  a traditional insurance industry measure of financial strength and underwriting capacity  was  at december   compared with at december  statutory surplus increased from resulting primarily from statutory net income of the group offset by the payment of of dividends to the corporation 
item continued the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is one of the measures used by insurance regulators to gauge the financial strength of an insurance company and indicates the ability of the group to grow by writing additional business 
at december   the group s net premiums written to surplus ratio was to compared to to in the naic has developed a risk based capital formula for property and casualty and life insurers 
the formula is intended to measure the adequacy of an insurer s capital given the asset and liability structure and product mix of the company 
as of december  and  all insurance companies in the group exceeded the necessary capital requirements 
reinsurance programs the group maintains several programs that provide reinsurance coverage which is intended to mitigate the impact of larger losses and catastrophic events 
the group s property per risk program covers property losses in excess of for each and every risk with a limit of the group s casualty exposures are reinsured through several contracts 
the casualty excess of loss contract retention is with limits of per occurrence 
this contract covers liability exposures for workers compensation  general liability  personal umbrella and commercial and personal automobile liability 
the st and nd contingency excess of loss contracts cover all casualty lines with retention of and limit of commercial umbrella exposures are reinsured by the st and nd cessions excess of loss contracts 
these contracts provide retention of and limit of per occurrence 
workers compensation catastrophe exposures are reinsured with the st and nd workers compensation catastrophe excess of loss contracts with retention of and limits of per occurrence 
the property catastrophe reinsurance program protects the group against an accumulation of losses arising from a catastrophe 
the program provides of coverage in excess of the group s retention 
over the last years  only two events triggered coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
both of these losses exceeded the prior retention amount of  resulting in significant recoveries from reinsurers 
reinsurance limits are purchased to cover exposure to catastrophic events having the probability of occurring approximately every years 
gai agreed to maintain reinsurance on the commercial lines business that the group acquired from gai and its affiliates in for loss dates prior to december  gai is obligated to reimburse the group if gai s reinsurers are unable to pay claims with respect to the acquired commercial lines business 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the consolidated corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail to meet these tests are reviewed and those that are determined by the group to have insufficient financial strength are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large base of reinsurers is utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
the group also records an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts as deemed necessary 
at december  and  no reinsurer accounted for more than percent of the reinsurance recoverable amount 
as a result of these measures  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
for more discussion on the reinsurance recoverable asset  see item  note  reinsurance  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  on page of this annual report on form k 
effective january   the group renewed the vast majority of its reinsurance program  with no significant changes in terms and conditions or reinsurers and with a less than increase in the total cost of the program

during  the consolidated corporation  as a result of improved profitability  revised its investment strategy to increase its investment into tax exempt securities 
the consolidated fixed income portfolio  which for this purpose includes cash equivalents  has an intermediate duration and a laddered maturity structure 
the duration of the fixed income portfolio was approximately and years as of december  and  respectively 
the consolidated corporation remains fully invested and does not time markets 
item continued fixed income securities are classified as investment grade or non investment grade based upon the higher of the ratings provided by s p and moody s 
when a security is not rated by either s p or moody s  the classification is based on other rating services  including the securities valuation office of the naic 
the market value of available for sale split rated fixed income securities ie  those having an investment grade rating from one rating agency and a below investment grade rating from another rating agency was and at december  and  respectively 
investments in below investment grade securities have greater risks than investments in investment grade securities 
the risk of default by borrowers that issue below investment grade securities is significantly greater because these borrowers are often highly leveraged and more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  including a recession or a sharp increase in interest rates 
additionally  investments in below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and subordinate to other debt 
investment grade securities are also subject to significant risks  including additional leveraging  changes in control of the issuer or worse than previously expected operating results 
in most instances  investors are unprotected with respect to these risks  the negative effects of which can be substantial 
following is a table displaying available for sale non investment grade and non rated securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and december   respectively amortized fair unrealized cost value loss the majority of mortgage backed security holdings included in the fixed income portfolio are in sequential structures  planned amortization class and agency pass through securities 
equity securities are carried at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  shareholders equity and statutory surplus fluctuate with changes in the value of the equity portfolio 
as of december   the equity portfolio consisted of stocks in a total of separate entities covering all ten major s p industry sectors 
of this total  was invested in five companies and the largest single position was of the equity portfolio 
at december   the equity portfolio consisted of stocks in separate entities in nine s p industry sectors 
of this total  was invested in five companies and the largest single position was of the equity portfolio 
the investment portfolio also includes non publicly traded securities such as private placements  non exchange traded equities and limited partnerships which are carried at fair value 
fair values are based on valuations from pricing services  brokers and other methods as determined by management to provide the most accurate price 
the carrying value of this portfolio at december   was compared to at december  the consolidated corporation uses assumptions and estimates when valuing certain investments and related income 
these assumptions include estimations of cash flows and interest rates 
although the consolidated corporation believes the values of its investments represent fair value  certain estimates could change and lead to changes in fair values due to the inherent uncertainties and judgments involved with accounting measurements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the consolidated corporation is exposed to other risks such as equity price risk  credit  reinvestment and liquidity risk 
credit risk refers to the financial risk that an obligation will not be paid and a loss will result 
reinvestment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall causing the reinvestment of interim cash flows to earn less than the original investment 
liquidity risk describes the ease with which an investment can be sold without substantially affecting the asset s price 
the sensitivity analysis below summarizes only the exposure to market risk and equity price risk 
the consolidated corporation strives to produce competitive returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of securities issued by high quality companies 
market risk the consolidated corporation has exposure to losses resulting from potential volatility in interest rates 
the consolidated corporation attempts to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management  periodic reviews of asset and liability positions and through maintaining a laddered fixed income portfolio with an intermediate duration 
estimates of cash flows and the impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to the fixed income investment portfolio are modeled quarterly and reviewed regularly 
equity price risk equity price risk can be separated into two elements 
the first  systematic risk  is the portion of a portfolio or individual security s price movement attributed to stock market movement as a whole 
the second element  nonsystematic risk  is the portion of price movement unique to the individual portfolio or security 
this risk can be further divided between characteristics of the industry and of the individual issuer 
the consolidated corporation attempted to manage nonsystematic risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diversified across industries and companies 
the following tables illustrate the hypothetical effect of an increase in interest rates of basis points and a decrease in equity values at december  and  respectively 
the changes selected above reflect management s view of shifts in rates and values that are quite possible over a one year period 
these rates should not be considered a prediction of future events 
interest rates may  in fact  be much more volatile in the future 
this analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity prices on income  cash flow or shareholders equity 
in addition  the analysis does not take into account any actions that may be taken to reduce the exposure in response to market fluctuations
