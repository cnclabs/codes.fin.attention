item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary in fiscal  our revenues increased compared with fiscal continuing the double digit revenue growth rate that we have experienced for the past three years 
our commercial business grew during fiscal reflecting strong growth in both our domestic as well as our international business 
our military business also grew from prior year levels 
although our gross profit also improved  the rate of increase was significantly smaller than our revenue growth due to competitive pressures  product mix and the increased costs of certain key raw materials 
for example  the price of copper increased more than during fiscal although operating expenses increased 
million from fiscal levels  approximately one half of this increase was due to legal costs associated with our lawsuit against tower manufacturing corporation 
research and development expenses and selling and marketing expenses together were approximately the same in fiscal as they were in fiscal our balance sheet showed dramatic improvement in fiscal with cash and investments increasing million and short and long term debt decreasing million 
overview we are an internationally recognized leader in the design  manufacture and sale of electrical safety products 
we market and sell our products through several channels of distribution including our in house sales force  retail  distribution  domestic and international oems and third party sales representation organizations 
we recognize revenues from equipment sales when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  delivery  including title passage has taken place  and collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers in sales transactions related to shipping and handling are classified as product revenues 
royalty revenues are recognized when we have delivered technical specifications and performed required services under the related agreement 
our gross margins are affected by many different factors including competitive price pressures  product mix  differences in manufacturing volumes  changes in the cost of raw materials  charges for excess or obsolete inventory  and costs of warranty repairs 
we generally provide a one year warranty on product sales 
we believe that our accrued warranty reserve is adequate to cover the cost of future warranty work on products we have sold 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  commissions and related employee expenses for sales personnel  advertising  promotional and trade show expenses  travel  consulting fees  and facilities expense 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  bonuses and related employee expenses  travel  consulting fees  facilities expense  legal and audit  and board of director fees 
research and development expenses principally include salaries for engineers and technical support staff  consulting  outside testing service fees  maintenance contracts on software  and depreciation of engineering equipment 
although our operating expenses increased over the past year  much of this increase was for legal expenses related to our lawsuit against tower manufacturing corporation that was initiated earlier in the fiscal year 
our year to year revenue growth has provided the funding to allow us to invest in additional research and development and provide the new products needed for growth as well as providing the marketing and sales resources needed to further enhance our revenues 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods shown years ended march  revenues commercial military royalties total revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development other total operating expenses income from operations interest expense other income income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal and comparison revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
commercial revenues  including rac revenues  increased million reflecting solid growth in most channels of distribution in both domestic and international markets 
military revenues increased million or to million from million in fiscal royalty income declined 
million to zero income for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in royalty income was due to non recurring royalties which were recorded in the prior year not repeated in fiscal gross profit increased 
million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the higher gross profit in fiscal was due to the million increase in revenues partially offset by lower margins on rac sales as a result of competitive pressure  a less favorable product mix and price increases from vendors 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues declined from for the fiscal year to in fiscal this decline in gross profit as a percent of revenue was also due to the lower margins on rac sales  the more unfavorable product mix in fiscal  and price increases from vendors 
selling and marketing expense of million  or of revenues  increased 
million for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues  for fiscal the 
million increase over the comparable period was primarily due to increases in compensation expense in fiscal selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue declined 
principally due to the million increase in revenue in fiscal we expect selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal as in fiscal general and administrative expense was million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenues  for fiscal  an increase of 
million  or 
the increase over the prior year was principally due to 
million in higher legal expense  of which 
million is a result of the tower lawsuit  
million in higher compensation  and 
million in higher consulting fees 
general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue increased 
from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the higher legal  compensation and consulting fees partially offset by the million increase in income in fiscal research and development expense was million of expense in both fiscal and fiscal research and development expense was as a percent of revenue for the year ended march  compared with for the year ended march  the 
decrease is due to the million increase in revenues in fiscal we expect research and development expense as a percent of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal compared with fiscal other income expense was 
million in expense in fiscal  an increase of 
million in expense from fiscal the increase was principally due to interest expense related to the higher level of borrowings on our line of credit for the entire fiscal year  whereas in fiscal  we had lower debt at the beginning of the fiscal year 
we expect to have decreased debt in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax expense declined 
million to 
million of expense for the fiscal year ended march  from 
million for the fiscal year ended march  the 
million reduction was principally due to the lower fiscal tax rate than in fiscal because more income was earned in honduras than in the prior year  and to the reversal of a tax accrual in the amount of 
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of concluding an audit by the internal revenue service for the fiscal year 
income tax expense as a percent of income before income taxes was for fiscal  compared with in fiscal without the fourth quarter reversal of the tax accrual of 
million  the tax rate would have been approximately 
our effective tax rate varies based on the mix of income before income taxes derived from our honduran subsidiary  which is not subject to income taxes  and the balance of income before income taxes  which is subject to income taxes 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we do not record deferred income taxes on the foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that is essentially permanent in duration 
our honduran subsidiary is profitable which decreases our effective tax rate 
if circumstances change  and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of the subsidiary will be remitted in the foreseeable future  but us income taxes have not been recognized by us  we will record as an expense of the current period the us income taxes attributed to that remittance 
we expect our effective income tax rate to be approximately in fiscal net income was million for fiscal  compared with million reported in fiscal  an increase of 
million 
higher fiscal gross profit and a lower tax provision were mostly offset by higher operating expense and higher interest expense when compared with fiscal fiscal and comparison revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million reported in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in commercial revenues was primarily attributed to rac product shipments and strong growth in our core commercial business 
military revenues remain steady due to solid demand for its control devices related to the tactical quiet generator programs for both existing and new systems 
the increase in royalty income was due a cancellation fee recorded in the fourth quarter related to the termination of certain license agreements with applica consumer products  inc pertaining to the use of our fire shield technology 
gross profit as a percent of revenue was of total revenues for fiscal  compared to in fiscal the major factors impacting our gross profit during the year were i higher than planned startup expenses at our honduran manufacturing facility and at our three far east contract manufacturers to produce the new fire shield lcdi power cords for use on room air conditioners  ii significant additional freight costs which we incurred to meet our rac customers delivery requirements  and iii competitive pricing required to capture market share in the new rac market 
having established the framework for the rac business in fiscal  we expect to achieve higher profit margins in fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expense was million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal  an increase of 
million  or 
the 
million increase over the comparable years was principally due to increases in salary expense primarily for additional personnel  outside sales commissions and travel expense 
we expect selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expense was million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal  an increase of 
million  or 
the increase over the comparable year was due to 
million of salary expense primarily for additional personnel  
million for shareholder board of director expenses  
million for audit and legal fees and 
million for d o insurance 
we expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expense was million  or of revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  for fiscal  an increase of 
million  or 
the increase over the comparable years was due to 
million of salary expense primarily for additional personnel  
million of ul fees and 
million for additional outside testing services  all of which were related to the support of the new room air conditioner market 
we expect research and development expense as a percentage of revenues to remain approximately the same in fiscal compared to fiscal other income expense increased slightly in fiscal  compared with fiscal but remained less than 
million for both years 
the small change was due to interest expense related to our borrowings on our line of credit  whereas in the prior year  we had no debt and recorded interest income on higher cash balances 
we expect to have decreased debt in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes as a percent of income before income taxes were for fiscal  compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate varies based on the mix of income before income taxes derived from our honduran subsidiary  which is not subject to income taxes  and the balance of income before income taxes  which is subject to income taxes 
at each reporting period  we make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year and applies that rate to the current year to date income before income taxes 
any difference between the current and preceding estimated effective tax rate expected for the full fiscal year is reflected as an adjustment in the current quarter s income tax expense 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  we do not record deferred income taxes on the foreign undistributed earnings of an investment in a foreign subsidiary that is essentially permanent in duration 
our honduran subsidiary is profitable which decreases our effective tax rate 
if circumstances change  and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of the subsidiary will be remitted in the foreseeable future  but us income taxes have not been recognized by us  we will record as an expense of the current period the us income taxes attributed to that remittance 
net income was million for fiscal  compared to million reported in fiscal  a decrease of 
basic earnings were 
per share and diluted earnings were 
per share in fiscal  compared to basic earnings of 
per share and diluted earnings of 
per share for fiscal net income was negatively impacted in fiscal by higher operating expenses and lower gross profit margins as described above 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates that we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates actually used resulting from events that could be reasonably foreseen as likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements once known 
in addition  we are periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled disclosure regarding forward looking statements and in section item a above  entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenue from commercial customers when an order has been received and accepted  pricing is fixed  delivery has occurred and title to the product has passed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title generally passes upon shipment to the customer  however  in a limited number of cases  title passes upon receipt of shipment by the customer 
we have no installation obligation subsequent to product shipment 
similarly  revenue from sales to distributors is recognized as title passes to them without additional involvement or obligation 
collection of receivables related to distributor sales is not contingent upon subsequent sales to third parties 
we may enter into government contracts that fall within the scope of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop non standard products or fall outside the scope of sop standard products 
for government contracts within the scope of sop  we record revenue under a units of delivery model with revenues and costs equal to the average unit value times the number of units delivered 
any estimated loss on an overall contract would be recognized in the period determined in accordance with sop for government contracts outside the scope of sop  we record revenue the same as for commercial customers discussed above and would record a loss in the event the costs to fulfill a government contract are in excess of the associated revenues 
we have not experienced past losses on government contracts  and currently  we do not have any transactions being accounted for within the scope of sop we record an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make timely payments of amounts due on account of product purchases 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information  including publicly available credit data  subscription based credit reports  trade association data  and analyzes factors such as historical bad debt experience  changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns  credit risk related to industry and geographical location and economic trends 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional write offs could be required  resulting in write offs not included in our current allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories 
because of the lead times required to obtain certain raw materials  we must maintain sufficient quantities on hand to meet expected product demand for each of our many products 
if actual demand is much lower than forecasted  we may not be able to dispose of our inventory at or above our cost 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete amounts to the lower of cost or market 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates each quarter or more frequently 
a reserve is established for inventory that has had no activity for long periods of time or for which management believes is no longer salable 
this reserve is reviewed and approved by the senior management team 
in the future  based on our quarterly analysis  if we estimate that any remaining reserve for obsolescence is either inadequate or in excess of the inventory reserve required  we may need to adjust it 
at present  based on our analysis  we believe the reserve is properly valued for the inventory held by us 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of any accrual for tax contingencies  any foreign withholding taxes or any united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiary  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required to be applied against the deferred tax assets 
it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and thereby indefinitely postpone their repatriation 
accordingly  no provision has been made for foreign withholding taxes or united states income taxes which may become payable if undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary are paid to us as dividends 
we apply the comparable profits method for transfer pricing to determine the amounts our subsidiary charges to the parent 
warranty 
we generally provide a one year warranty period for all of our products 
we also provide coverage on certain of our surge products for downstream damage of products not manufactured by us 
our warranty provision represents our estimate of probable liabilities  calculated as a function of sales volume and historical repair experience for each product under warranty 
our warranty accrual represents our estimate of our liability for warranty repairs that we will incur over the warranty period 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for possible impairment of carrying value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefit of our assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to be derived from the use of individual assets over their remaining amortization period 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its anticipated undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying value and its fair value 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements about our expectations of what could happen in the future 
forward looking statements involve uncertainties and risk and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward looking statements due to many known and unknown factors  including but not limited to those previously discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report
