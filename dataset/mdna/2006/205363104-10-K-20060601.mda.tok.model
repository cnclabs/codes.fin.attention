item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of computer sciences corporation csc or the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended march  there are three primary objectives of this discussion to provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements  as presented through the eyes of management  to enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes  providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed  and to provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results 
to achieve these objectives  the discussion is presented in the following sections overview includes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash  as well as a discussion of the key business drivers  economic and industry factors  fiscal highlights and fiscal commentary 
results of operations discusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal to  describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reporting segment basis  including new contracts  acquisitions and currency impacts  and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories

overview the company s primary service offerings are outsourcing and i t and professional services 
outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customer s technology infrastructure and applications  and business process outsourcing 
i t and professional services include systems integration  consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services 
csc provides these services to customers in the global commercial and us federal government markets 
on a geographic basis  csc provides services to global commercial customers in the united states  europe and other international locations 
operations in australia  asia and canada generate substantially all revenue within other international 
economic and industry factors global commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on i t projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
the us federal market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of 
table of contents the us government can also impact the future of projects 
the company recognized the us government s increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development efforts in these areas 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting from less than six months to years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  the ability to compete on price  services offered  technical ability  experience and flexibility  the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues  the ability to successfully identify and divest non core operations which may impact revenue in the short term but provide resources to pursue longer term growth and value creation opportunities  and currency fluctuations related to international operations 
earnings are driven by the above revenue factors  in addition to the following the ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals  and the ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore 
cash flows are impacted by the above earnings factors  in addition to other factors including the following timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  cash flow and return on investment 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous external factors 
csc employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
with a wide array of services offered  the company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of acquisitions or dispositions of 
table of contents business with different cost profiles  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company s costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of offshore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
cash flow over time the primary drivers of the company s cash flow are earnings provided by the company s operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings 
also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances 
the company also regularly reviews the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows  as well as non gaap free cash flow 
return on investment roi roi is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization 
a combination of strong margins measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue and investment base turnover measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital is required to generate sufficient returns on capital 
strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns 
readers should be cautioned that dso  free cash flow and roi are not gaap measures  and the company s definition of such measures may differ from other companies 
therefore  such measures may not be comparable to those of other companies 
csc calculates dso as follows total receivables at quarter end divided by revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the fiscal quarter 
free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating cash flows  investing cash flows  excluding business acquisitions and dispositions  purchase or sale of available for sale securities and capital lease payments 
roi is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover 
the profit margin used is profit before interest and special items and after tax divided by revenues 
investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity 
fiscal highlights significant events during fiscal include revenues rose  approximately before currency fluctuations 
income from continuing operations grew 
continuing earnings per share  after special charges  were up 
the special charge of cents per share adversely impacted continuing earnings per share compared to prior year by 
announced contract awards of billion with new us federal awards of billion  and new global commercial awards totaling billion 
free cash flow of million declined million from million in fiscal the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure fiscal year ended in millions march  april  april  free cash flow net cash used in investing activities acquisition  net of cash acquired business dispositions capital lease payments available for sale securities see note net cash provided by operating activities capital lease payments and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment included in investing activities are included in the calculation of free cash flow 
prior periods have been adjusted to conform with this presentation 

table of contents dso was days at year end versus days at the end of the prior year 
debt to total capitalization ratio was at year end  consistent with prior year ratio 
roi from continuing operations was for the year a 
point improvement from prior year 
the exchange of the company s health plan solutions unit for million shares of the company s stock held by a subsidiary of dst systems inc and the subsequent recognition of a million gain from the exchange in april the company expects the gain to be exempt from income tax 
gain from the working capital adjustment settlement for the sale of dyncorp international of million  after tax 
the company s significant wins in fiscal included the following global commercial dupont billion  bae systems billion  general dynamics million  schroders million  us federal us army billion  center for medicare and medicaid services million  us air force th space wing million  us air force air education training command million  department of defense missile defense agency million  and nasa shared services center million 
these multi year awards represent the estimated value of the company s portion at contract signing 
they cannot be considered firm orders  however  due to their variable attributes  including demand driven usage  modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements  annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the company s us federal activities 
revenue growth in the global commercial sector was the result of recent years significant contract wins 
us federal sector wins have also been strong  particularly in the department of defense service area 
currency shifts during the year unfavorably impacted revenue 
the company s growth has created a broad  long term global revenue base across numerous customers  industries  geographic regions and service offerings 
approximately of csc s revenues come from long term contracts including global commercial outsourcing and us federal government engagements 
an increase in investment in working capital as the result of contracts awarded during fiscal reduced cash flow from operations during fiscal these increases in working capital were anticipated and were financed from current cash flows enabling the company to maintain the debt to capitalization ratio at the reduced levels achieved in fiscal cash out flow for investing activities  adjusted for the disposition of dyncorp international  declined from prior year as a result of lower levels of investment in outsourcing contracts  equipment and software 
fiscal commentary as a leading federal contractor and one of the top i t service providers to the us federal government  csc s us federal sector is well positioned to benefit from anticipated growing demand 
the us federal 
table of contents government is one of the world s largest i t services consumers  and its spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense  homeland security and civil agency modernization 
while the ultimate distribution of us federal funds and project assignments can vary  the company expects its broad i t and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the us federal government 
the company s major pursuits in the global commercial market during fiscal focused on the renewal and extension of major global outsourcing contracts with such efforts rewarded by the dupont and bae systems awards as well as schroders  british nuclear group and general dynamics extensions or expansions noted above 
in addition  the company has been and will continue to be selective in new business pursuit opportunities given the focus on margin expansion and increasing return on investment 
with respect to discretionary spending and project work  central and southern europe continue to show areas of soft demand while north american demand for consulting and systems integration is strengthening  although price pressures continue 
while the future demand for outsourcing services is not known with certainty  the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows csc to benefit from a certain level of continuity 
growth during fiscal in global commercial revenue from new business awarded during fiscal and is expected to be tempered by the termination or reduction in scope of a few significant outsourcing engagements and reduced rates of recovery on renewed engagements 
during fiscal  the company s global commercial segment s revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency fluctuations in europe and other international regions 
the company cannot forecast with certainty future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results 
other trends the company expects for fiscal are as follows in europe significant outsourcing wins in fiscal generated revenue growth in outsourcing during fiscal revenue growth from these engagements may slow as these engagements mature and billing rates are adjusted to industry benchmarks 
the impact of rising demand for utilization of offshore capabilities on current and future engagements will also impact the pace of future revenue growth in europe 
the company has identified billion of federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal which the company expects to pursue  plus an additional billion during fiscal the company expects to win a share of the awards 
the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment  during the first quarter of fiscal expensing of employee stock options and awards is expected to result in the recognition of approximately million of pre tax expense  three quarters of which is projected to be in selling  general and administrative expense and the balance in costs of services 
the million is an estimate  as the actual amount is subject to the number of options granted and changes in the share price of csc 
the fiscal estimate is approximately million pre tax higher than amounts recorded in fiscal under accounting principles board opinion no 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for the us federal sector is expected to rise as contracts with the us army and other agencies with significant capital content come on line 
the decreased impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences is expected to increase the company s effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal cash flow from operations for fiscal  including the impact of the restructuring plan announced in april  is expected to decline slightly from the  million for fiscal outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal and  as well as contractually driven equipment replacement requirements on existing contracts  are expected to drive fiscal investing cash outflows 
significant investing outflows are expected for engagements to provide commercial outsourcing infrastructure 
despite the anticipated investments for outsourcing engagements  investing cash outflows are expected to decrease slightly during fiscal total operating cash inflows are expected to more than cover total investing outflows for fiscal 
table of contents the company s overall short term financial objectives include successfully launch the new contracts won during fiscal effectively manage working capital and capital investment 
maintain appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins  with particular emphasis on the new business  in order to improve return on investment 
pursue the current pipeline of commercial and us federal opportunities and win a proportionate share 
manage the announced restructuring plan see discussion below to achieve the expected results 
the company s primary long term objective is to continue developing and obtaining the core capabilities and differentiating factors that will enable csc to compete effectively in both the federal and global commercial markets 
the company will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that enhance its core capabilities and review its portfolio of business operations for overall strategic fit 
continued long term revenue and earnings growth will come from the combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
subsequent to fiscal year end  the company announced a response to recent expressions of interest  and stated that csc s board of directors has decided to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  including a potential sale of the company 
there can be no assurance the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction  and the company does not intend to disclose developments regarding its exploration unless and until the board of directors has reached a conclusion 
during the period in which uncertainty exists as to the future direction the company takes  demand for the company s services could be adversely impacted 
in april  the company announced a restructuring plan which will be carried out during fiscal and the objectives of the plan are to streamline csc s worldwide operation and leverage the increased use of lower cost resources 
workforce reductions of approximately  and employees are planned for fiscal and  respectively  which will result in associated estimated pre tax restructuring charges of million 
restructuring charges will consist predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations 
in addition  the company will evaluate facility requirements as a result of the headcount reductions and certain charges could occur from early lease cancellations or ceasing use of facility space 
a majority of the planned workforce reductions  in fiscal and in will take place in europe 
approximately  and heads will be reduced in north america in fiscal and  respectively  with the balance in australia and asia 
partially offsetting the reductions will be headcount increases in certain lower cost regions of approximately  and employees in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the restructuring  the company expects total pre tax savings of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  net of the new costs from headcount increases in the lower cost regions 
while the impact on specific cost elements cannot yet be determined  future costs of services and selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to represent a lower percentage of revenues as a result of the overall lower cost structure

the growth was primarily from outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal and growth in the consulting and systems integration business 
new contracts contributing to the growth were sun  ascension health  textron and aon when combined  contributed million to revenue growth for fiscal this revenue growth and the contribution from us consulting and systems integration were partially offset by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain significant outsourcing contracts and the termination of significant outsourcing contracts with nortel networks and jpmorgan chase

europe revenues increased million for fiscal  representing growth  in constant currency 
major new engagements contributing to this performance included the uk national health service and the european operations of zurich financial services  as well as the full year impact of the fiscal sas group and national grid transco contract commencements 
revenue growth attributable to these new engagements of approximately million and favorable currency movement of approximately million were offset by continued weakness in demand for the company s consulting and systems integration services in continental europe as well as reduced scope on certain existing outsourcing engagements 

table of contents us commercial revenue increased by million or for fiscal this growth is primarily attributable to new fiscal and outsourcing contracts with the us operations of zurich financial services  aon  ascension health  textron and motorola  with total fiscal revenue growth impact of approximately million 
this impact and slight growth in the company s us consulting and systems integration business were offset somewhat by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain major outsourcing contracts 
other international revenues were up million from fiscal  though down in constant currency  primarily the result of reduced product sales  including the closure of a product reseller business in australia

u 
s federal sector revenue growth for fiscal was with revenue up million to  million 
the revenue growth was driven by new business awarded during fiscal and and increases on existing department of defense contracts 
this growth was partially offset by the completion of the development phase on a state contract and reduced scope on a small number of significant programs 
the us federal sector continued to win significant new business during fiscal with announced new us federal contract awards of billion versus billion for fiscal and billion for fiscal department of defense revenue increased million or to  million for fiscal growth was the result of increased demand for equipment procurement and installation services for the us army  a new program to provide aviation support services  new tasking on programs to provide logistical support to the us army  new tasking to provide technical support for the navy s undersea test facilities  a multiple award contract to provide professional services to naval sea systems command  a new program to provide support services for the us strategic command and i t engineering and management services for certain intelligence services 
these new programs and tasking provided approximately million in revenue growth for fiscal the remainder of the revenue increase during fiscal was the result of normal contract activities including new tasking on various projects and various new programs 
civil agencies revenue was down million or versus fiscal  driven by the reduction in scope for a significant project with the internal revenue service 
the impact of the scope reduction on this project was approximately million 
new tasking on projects for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa offset scope reductions and the completion of other programs 
work performed by the us federal sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was million for fiscal  down million 
the decrease was the result  primarily  of a reduction of effort on a contract with the new york department of health 
this was offset somewhat by a project with a foreign government to provide information technology services 

table of contents u 
s federal sector revenue for fiscal of  million was down million or compared to fiscal the revenue decline was driven by the completion  reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant programs  with a total impact of approximately million 
this impact  as well as that of other routine completions and volume reductions  was partially offset by program commencements and increased tasking on other programs 
department of defense revenue was down million or for fiscal the completion of and reduced efforts on several logistics contracts for the us army as well as the de consolidation of a previously consolidated joint venture due to decreased csc ownership accounted for approximately million of revenue reduction 
partially offsetting these reductions were new contracts for equipment procurement and installation for the us army and i t engineering and management efforts for the intelligence services  new tasking from the navy for computing equipment support  and a new contract to provide flight simulators to the us army 
these increases totaled approximately million 
the net impact of other normal contract activities start ups  completions  increased and decreased volumes accounted for the remaining change in revenue 
civil agencies revenue was down million or versus fiscal  driven by the completion of significant projects with nasa and the federal bureau of investigation 
the impact of these completions was approximately million 
scope reductions on other programs were partially offset by revenue from new contracts  including a program with the department of health and human services 
work performed by the us federal sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was million for fiscal  down million 
the decrease was driven primarily by a decline in development work on a contract with the new york department of health as the development stage of the contract winds down

points to from for fiscal with most ratios improved or unchanged from the prior year 
the cost of services ratio decreased as a result of cost management and revenue settlements for which the associated costs were recorded in a prior period 
the interest expense ratio decreased primarily as the result of the retirement of billion of term debt during march these decreases were offset by the impairment charge and loss on sale of equipment due to the termination of portions of the nortel networks contract recorded as a special item in fiscal the company substantially matches revenues and costs in the same currency 
therefore  foreign currency did not have a material impact on costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue 
however  the company is increasing its use of offshore support and therefore may be exposed to additional margin fluctuations 
costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal of were in line with fiscal levels  with certain identifiable variance factors generally offsetting 
the depreciation and amortization ratio was up somewhat  driven by fixed asset investments in the us federal sector and an unfavorable mix variance resulting

the ratio for fiscal benefited  as noted below  from cost of services amounts carried at the corporate level for fiscal which included million of accrued cost related to the settlement of an overtime pay class action lawsuit 
the global commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal benefited from reductions in the ratio in europe as a result of outsourcing improvements in the united kingdom offset somewhat by higher ratios for other european consulting and systems integration business 
these improvements in europe were offset by a higher ratio for us outsourcing as a result of start up and termination activities and an unfavorable mix impact as revenue from higher margin software license sales was lower for the year 
the costs of services ratio benefited from certain revenue items such as revenue settlements with clients for which the related costs were recognized in a prior period  a pre tax million gain from the sale of a building and the novation of certain contracts 
these items favorably benefited the ratio approximately 
points 
the us federal sector ratio for fiscal benefited from increased margins for certain time and materials contracts on subcontractor work and materials and cost containment on a fixed unit price contract 
the year over year comparison also benefited 
from unfavorable adjustments during fiscal on certain programs for which recovery of costs was not probable 
these factors were somewhat offset by an adverse estimate to complete adjustment on a state project contributing approximately 
points to the ratio 
for fiscal costs of services as a percentage of revenue were  unchanged from fiscal the global commercial sector ratio was essentially unchanged  vs 
 but had an approximately 
favorable mix impact on the company s composite ratio due to the increase in global commercial operations as a percentage of the total 
with a higher proportion of infrastructure services and a broader service offering  the global commercial sector cost base has relatively more depreciation and amortization and selling  general and administrative expenses and less labor and other cost of services than the us federal sector 
the global commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal benefited from certain revenue items  including the recognition of deferred revenue related to a renegotiated contract  client settlement payments and gains on the sale of minor  non core businesses 
these had an approximately 
favorable impact on the ratio 
the ratio also included the adverse impact of costs related to facility consolidations in our us consulting operations  certain asset write downs to net realizable value  and the cost of closure for our australian product reseller business 
these factors had an adverse impact of approximately 
on the cost of services ratio 
us federal sector cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased approximately

an increase in the ratio for the us 
table of contents federal operations of 
points was offset by a decrease in the global commercial ratio of 
points 
the us federal sector ratio increase was attributable to increased expenses in the new business development area and increased management and bid and proposal costs 
the global commercial ratio improvement was the result of savings in new business selling costs as a result of fewer significant new business opportunities and a reduction in general and administrative costs 
global commercial sg a expense was adversely impacted by a pre tax million provision for doubtful accounts related to negotiations with an outsourcing customer regarding certain contract provisions 
the 
point fiscal sg a improvement compared to fiscal was attributable to improvement from both of csc s segments 
the us federal sector contributed approximately two thirds of the improvement  driven by reduced bid and proposal costs as a percentage of revenue as well as executive and administrative staff and other cost reductions 
global commercial ratio improvement was the result of leveraging existing levels of staff and systems to support the higher revenue level  particularly in us outsourcing operations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of  million for fiscal represents of revenue and was unchanged from the ratio of for fiscal improvement in the us federal sector ratio was offset by an increase in the global commercial ratio 
the us federal sector ratio decreased by 
point predominantly due to decreases in amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the dyncorp acquisition 
the global commercial ratio increased as a result of significant upfront capital investment for outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal and in europe and asia and capital refreshes necessary on some existing contracts  offset by lower levels of capital investment for us commercial operations due to the termination of the nortel and sears contracts and a favorable mix variance from australian operations due to revenue growth in non capital intensive business lines 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to from for fiscal versus fiscal the us federal sector ratio increase  accounting for approximately 
of the company s ratio increase  was most significantly attributable to fixed asset investments on a large infrastructure outsourcing contract 
an unfavorable mix variance  also contributing 
of the ratio rise  was the result of the increasing global commercial activities share of the total 
global commercial operations  with a higher proportion of infrastructure related services  had a higher ratio of depreciation and amortization expense to revenue 
the mix impact was offset somewhat  and the global commercial ratio decreased slightly for fiscal  due to new outsourcing accounts  particularly in the us  having lower depreciation and amortization than the existing composite business 
this was primarily attributable to certain new clients for which csc did not purchase the existing asset inventory  but will be responsible for asset replacement 
therefore  the depreciation ratio on those accounts can be expected to rise over time 
interest expense and interest income the decrease in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average debt levels during fiscal as the result of the retirement of billion of term debt during march the interest saving from the retirement of the term debt was slightly offset by an increase in interest expense from capitalized leases  and short term borrowings for working capital needs in europe 
the combination of these factors resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million 
in addition  interest income  including dividend income from the dyncorp international preferred stock  increased approximately million for fiscal resulting in a 
improvement in the net interest expense ratio 
during may  the company received approximately million from dyncorp international for the redemption of the preferred stock and payment of cumulative dividends of approximately million 
the decrease in interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average debt levels and an increase in interest income 
the generation of cash flow  which limited the need 
table of contents to issue commercial paper  and the retirement of billion of term debt during march combined to reduce interest expense by million 
in addition  interest income  including income from the invested proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international  increased approximately million for fiscal resulting in a 
improvement in the net interest expense ratio 
special items effective february  nortel networks nortel terminated the company s services for certain information technology outsourcing activities under the outsourcing agreement between nortel and the company 
as a result of the termination of these services the company recorded a non cash special charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal to write down outsourcing contract costs and certain equipment associated with the contract to their estimated fair value 
the company recorded an additional charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million to write down the remaining assets to fair value  recognize a loss on the assets sold to nortel under the terms of the termination settlement  record severance costs for those employees who were not hired by nortel or redeployed within the company and record costs associated with terminating the contract for a total charge of million million after tax or cents per share 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded a charge of million for premium payments and the write down of deferred financing costs and interest discount related to the early redemption of billion of term debt 
the company elected to make this early redemption and incur the charges as it had available cash and these debt issues carried interest rates above current prevailing rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description 
the debt redemption charge was partially offset by the reversal in the fourth quarter of previously recorded facility restructuring accruals of 
million 
the combined special items had a per share impact on earnings per share and a 
net impact on the company s profit margin in fiscal csc s net profit margin for fiscal was reduced 
for charges associated with the special item related to the dyncorp acquisition 
the charges relate to exit or disposal activities of legacy csc operations as a result of an assessment of requirements for the combined csc dyncorp organization 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description 
charges related to this special item were booked during the fourth quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal and had a per share impact on earnings per share in fiscal the impact to fiscal margins was insignificant 
taxes the provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate during fiscal was the result of the favorable resolution of certain tax related issues from prior years and the subsequent reversal of amounts accrued for these issues 
this offset the diminishing favorable impact on the effective rate of permanent tax differences 
the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily a result of increased profits and the decreasing impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences that do not vary directly with increased profits 
the increases in pretax income in fiscal and resulted in a million and million increase in taxes on income from continuing operations for fiscal and  respectively  compared to previous fiscal years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations net of taxes was million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal years  and income from discontinued operations during fiscal included the gain on sale of health plan solutions of million and the gain from the working capital adjustment for the sale of dyncorp international of million 
the company received million par value preferred stock for the working capital adjustment and recorded taxes of million and a valuation 
table of contents allowance of approximately million against the preferred stock 
income from discontinued operations during fiscal includes the net after tax gain on the sale of dyncorp international of million or approximately per share 
in fiscal  proceeds from the sale included million of cash and million of par value preferred stock 
discontinued operations for fiscal and included the operations of dyncorp international  sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the operations of health plan solutions which was classified as held for sale as of april  and sold during the first quarter of fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
during fiscal  the company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million after tax or per share as a result of implementing the interpretation to account for the company s unrecorded legal obligations to restore some of its leased facilities to their original condition upon lease expiration 
earnings per share and share base earnings per share from continuing operations increased to for fiscal earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal were adversely impacted by special charges of per share  and were favorably impacted by an increase in income from continuing operations and a decline in average share base of million for fiscal this decline in the share base was driven primarily by the company s acquisition of million treasury shares in the hps exchange which reduced weighted average shares outstanding by million shares for fiscal this reduction was partially offset by employee stock option exercises during fiscal common stock equivalents declined slightly on a year over year basis 
financial condition cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash and cash equivalents have been provided from operating activities 
operating activities for fiscal generated billion in net cash compared to billion generated for fiscal and reflect the anticipated increase in investment in working capital assets as the result of new business won during fiscal as discussed below changes to the company s working capital such as lower levels of accounts payable and year over year declines in the increase in the balances of accrued expenses and deferred revenue drove the decrease in operating cash flow 
the company s working capital was impacted by during fiscal the company s investment in unbilled receivables increased approximately million  related primarily to federal contracts  compared to an increase in unbilled receivables of approximately million in fiscal as a result dso increased to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of last year 

table of contents the company s investment in deferred costs and work in progress related to certain contracts increased approximately million offset somewhat by the expense recognition of deferred costs on other contracts during fiscal accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million for fiscal compared to an increase of million for fiscal the decrease in the balance for fiscal was the result of the timing of payments for accounts payable offset somewhat by an increase in accrued expenses for activities on new contracts  the winding down of certain contracts and increased subcontractor costs on certain government contracts 
the company made payments for taxes of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
advanced payments received from customers during fiscal decreased as a result of the winding down of a contract and lower advanced payments on another contract as the contract transitions out of the start up phase 
the result was a decrease in advanced payments from these contracts for fiscal of approximately million compared to fiscal this decrease was somewhat offset by advanced payments on other various contracts during fiscal the company has submitted requests for equitable adjustment reas totaling in excess of million on two us federal contracts 
included in current assets on the company s balance sheet is approximately million of unbilled accounts receivable and deferred costs related to the contracts 
csc has requested payment for certain related out of scope work directed or caused by the customers in support of their critical missions 
the contractual modification process for scope changes has lagged behind the need for csc to provide critical on going operational support 
the company does not record any profit element when it defers costs associated with such reas 
the company believes it has a legal basis for pursuing recovery of these reas and that collection is probable 
settlement of the amounts depends on individual circumstances and negotiations with the parties and we are unable to predict the timing of resolution of the reas 
operating activities for fiscal generated billion in net cash  up from billion generated for fiscal higher net earnings  coupled with higher levels of accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue  drove the increase in operating cash 
in addition  higher non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and an increase in deferred revenue as a result of prepayments from customers for services and up front payments for contract start up and transition activities contributed to the increase in cash generated from operating activities 
partially offsetting these inflows was an increase in prepaid expenses as the result of increases in work in process and deferred costs related to expected contract modifications with the us federal government  and an increase in receivables due to the growth in revenue 
the increase in receivables was driven by the increase in revenues 
the company s capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the company s expanding global commercial operations 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
for cash flow presentation purposes  the outsourcing contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet 
outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contract s acquisition or start up  including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premium 
outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal  including zurich financial services and ascension health contracts and design and build contracts with the united kingdom s national health service  drove much of the investing cash out flow during the year 
while increasing new business will typically generate higher overall capital investments  the mix of the new business will also impact the level of capital 
the growth in us federal awards during fiscal and the expected growth in consulting and systems integration work is expected to limit the growth in overall capital 
table of contents investment in fiscal as us federal contracts and consulting and systems integration projects typically require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial outsourcing contracts 
this coupled with the company s continued focus on improving cash flows and return on investment is expected to result in a decrease in cash outflow from investing activities for fiscal dispositions of investments in businesses have from time to time generated investing cash flows for the company 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the disposition of dyncorp international generated million in cash proceeds 
as discussed below the company used these proceeds to reduce debt levels during that quarter 
as described above  historically a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
fiscal continued to reflect this trend as the company s debt level remained at or near its lowest level since fiscal financing cash flows for fiscal reflected the company s continued commitment to reduce its overall debt levels and improve its debt to total capitalization ratio as the proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international were utilized to redeem billion of term debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal cash outflows to redeem the term debt included million of early redemption premiums 
at year end fiscal and  there was no outstanding commercial paper  a result of cash generated from operations 
partially offsetting the financing cash out flows were cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal and during fiscal the company issued million of term debt due april with the proceeds used to reduce outstanding commercial paper and support general corporate purposes 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  million at march    million at april   and million at april  during fiscal  equity increased as a result of the company s earnings  the exercise of employee stock options and the impact on equity of a decrease in the unfunded pension obligation of million million net of taxes  partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustment of million and the acquisition of treasury stock 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  consistent with fiscal year end and down from at the end of fiscal this debt ratio improvement is the result of debt reduction and equity increases during fiscal and fiscal the company s debt to total capitalization ratio of as of the end of fiscal is low compared to the company s ratios during the last five years 
however  the ratio may rise in the future if the company identifies suitable investment opportunities or experiences other significant capital requirements 
dollars in millions debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization the company s sources of liquidity include cash  commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements 
forecasted positive cash flows for the year are expected to limit the need for short term borrowings during fiscal at march   the company had a committed line of credit providing million of long term commercial paper backup which expires on august  if the company were unable to sell its commercial paper  borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit  or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned  the company has the ability to borrow under this committed line of credit 
this line of credit has the option of being drawn at a base rate  a eurodollar rate or a bid option rate 
the line requires the company 
table of contents to limit liens placed on our assets to million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business  maintain a not to exceed ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of 
to  and not permit on any date the ratio of consolidated total debt outstanding to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date  to exceed to 
for further details on this agreement please see exhibit  which is incorporated by reference to this annual report 
as of march  the company s total liquidity was approximately  million which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  million and availability under the syndicated backstop credit facility of million 
as of march   the company had no borrowings under this credit facility and was in compliance with all terms of the agreement 
at march   the company had million of short term borrowings and billion of long term debt 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the classification of the commercial paper is determined by the expiration date of its credit facility 
the company had no outstanding commercial paper as of march  in march  the company used the proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international and cash on hand to redeem the term notes due august  and the term notes due june for million  and an early redemption premium of million 
in addition  during fiscal  the company issued million of term debt from its fiscal shelf registration 
on march   the company instituted a voluntary share repurchase program for shareholders owning less than shares 
under this program which has now expired  the company repurchased  shares for million on april  and  shares for 
million on may  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of march  dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit standby letters of credit foreign subsidiary debt guarantees total see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

table of contents regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
the above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the company has numerous plans  both inside and outside of the us  and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis 
the minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  and can be zero in some years 
funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including erisa and cost accounting standards cas 
while there are certain minimum contribution requirements  csc may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments  changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal company contributions amounted to million 
these fiscal year contribution figures may differ from those in note to the consolidated financial statements due to the use of a december st measurement date in that note 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  and unused short term borrowing capacity 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of debt and or equity securities 
the company has previously issued million worth of term debt from the shelf registration  leaving million of shelf available for additional securities 
there can be no assurances the company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
while changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements  the risk is mitigated by our broad portfolio of contracts that would typically have offsetting adjustments 

table of contents we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates 
revenue from our fixed unit price contracts  time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time 
however  for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation 
under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved 
costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  we may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
we routinely negotiate such contract modifications in both the us federal and global commercial segments 
many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers 
the total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value 
these relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value 
once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements  revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered 
estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume difference  changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 

table of contents capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
we utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs  we must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine deferred income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities  but even 
table of contents those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
as goodwill is not amortized  goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment 
such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values 
cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates  which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance  operations and program management 
key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities we offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan  the asset mix of the plan  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
the weighted average of the expected long term rates of return  for all plans  on plan assets utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time 
for csc  positive market returns for fiscal and fiscal caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected 
declining discount rates over the past 
table of contents several years  which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations  served to partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the end of the year 
at the end of both fiscal and fiscal  some of our pension plans had abos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets  thus requiring additional minimum obligations 
the excess at the end of fiscal was lower than at the end of fiscal as a result  we were required to adjust the additional minimum pension liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the effect of this adjustment was to decrease the minimum pension liability by million during fiscal  decrease intangible assets by million and record an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of million million net of taxes 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional changes to equity might be required 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  the company is increasing its use of offshore support and is therefore becoming more exposed to currency fluctuations 
if necessary  the company may use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at march   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
