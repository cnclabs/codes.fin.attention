the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns 
today s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years 
demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  economic conditions  supply  demand  and prices for semiconductors  customer capacity requirements  and our ability to develop and market competitive products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal years   and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

customer demand increased throughout fiscal year fiscal year new orders entered into backlog increased compared to fiscal year with growth occurring in all regions as a function of the increase in customer demand 
fiscal year revenues  derived from our shipment levels and installation and acceptance timelines  increased compared to fiscal year revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market  with the strongest geographic momentum in japan and korea 
gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than for the second consecutive year 
fiscal year quarterly gross margin as a percent of revenues showed steady growth on increasing volume 
total operating expenses increased during fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily driven by increases in discretionary r d spending consistent with our product and market expansion plans  equity based compensation expense  salary costs as a result of increased headcount  planned increases in employee base compensation  and employee incentive based costs 
fiscal year operating expenses included million in restructuring charges related to prior restructuring plans 
equity based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was million and million  respectively 
results of operations new orders and backlog new orders entered into backlog during fiscal year are presented in the table below 
unshipped orders in backlog as of june  were approximately million 
the basis for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy

revenue year ended june  june  june  in thousands revenue the increase in revenues during fiscal year and fiscal year reflected the improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers 
we believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period  with particularly strong geographic performance in japan and korea during fiscal year and the overall asia region during fiscal year the overall asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region 
our deferred revenue balance increased to million as of june  compared to million at june   consistent with overall business volumes 
the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately million as of june  these shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers

research and development year ended june  june  june  in thousands  except percentages research development r d percent of total revenue we invested significantly in research and development focused on leading edge plasma etch  strip and clean product and market applications 
the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to approximately million in increased supplies and outside services  approximately million in increased equity based compensation expense and approximately million in increased salary and benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount 
approximately of fiscal year systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years 
the growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately million for planned increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly million for incentive based compensation triggered by higher profits 
the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in r d supplies expense of approximately million

also included in the increase was approximately million in professional services which included  among other items  expenditures for certain discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company 
these increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year of a net million tax refund from the california state board of equalization for previously paid sales and use tax and approximately million in equity based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award

during fiscal year  average interest rate yields on the company s portfolio increased approximately basis points compared to fiscal year the company s total balances of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash and investments  increased approximately million from fiscal year this increase included the company s wholly owned subsidiary s drawdown against a million credit agreement to support the company s foreign earnings repatriation of million under the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the remaining increase of million was primarily driven by million from cash flows from operating activities 

table of contents the sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields 
interest expense and debt issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated million notes notes in june tax expense our annual income tax expense was million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year  excluding the discrete event discussed below  was 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year related to the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate  the realization of state r d tax credits not previously benefited  favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bi lateral advanced pricing arrangement 
these favorable adjustments for the year were offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year of a million extraordinary dividend under the american jobs creation act of  combined with the impact of the accounting for equity based awards in accordance with sfas no 
r and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions  and the expiration of the research tax credit on december  the fiscal year tax rate was  which primarily reflects the impact of r d tax credits and foreign income taxed at lower than us statutory tax rates 
in fiscal year  we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required 
this resulted in a million credit recorded to income tax expense  during fiscal year deferred income taxes we had gross deferred tax assets  related primarily to reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible  and tax credit carryforwards of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no

accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only realize these attributes in accordance with footnote of sfas r 
these additional tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances  if any 
during fiscal year  we released a valuation allowance of million on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required 
subsequent events on july   the supreme court of california denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of lam with respect to a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers 
as a result of the denied review  the prior rulings from the trial and appellate courts stand resulting in a judgment in favor of lam of approximately million  which includes approximately million in post judgment interest 
we plan to record this amount in other income expense  net during the quarter ending september  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable  and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  complex and or subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and we have completed our system installation obligations  received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision  we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications 
in situations with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values  provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs  which approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 
transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance 
standard costs are re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs  generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts  currently obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels  and overhead for internally manufactured products 
manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage requirements over the next to months is written down to its estimated market value  if less than cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  general semiconductor market conditions  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market 
table of contents conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty typically  the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system 
we offer standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of months from system acceptance  not to exceed months from shipment of the system to the customer 
when appropriate  we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity  which uses factors such as type of system  customer  geographic region  and any known factors such as tool reliability trends 
all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 
actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis  and may differ from our original estimates 
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates  we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves  all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 
equity based compensation employee stock purchase plan and employee stock plans beginning on june  we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock plans under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in net income 
the fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of our stock options and espp awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing sfas no 
r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 
r and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for our espp and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in paid in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement continuing operations rather than through paid in capital 
we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under apb no 
for income tax footnote disclosure purposes 
we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid in capital in accordance with footnote of sfas r 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 

table of contents we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 
we provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates 
our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the company  the level of r d spending  the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed 
we carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate  if necessary 
if actual results differ from estimates  we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate  which could have a material impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the company s expectations could have a material impact on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
the company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we are currently in the process of determining the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of fin on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had billion in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash and investments compared with million at june  we entered into long term debt of million during fiscal year to provide sufficient liquidity to support our foreign earnings repatriation of million under the american jobs creation act of the remaining increase of million was derived from cash flows from operating activities of million  issuance of common stock from employee equity based plans of million  partially offset by stock repurchases of million and capital expenditures and purchases of intangible assets of million 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal year consisted of in millions net income non cash charges depreciation and amortization equity based compensation other  net income tax benefit on equity based compensation plans excess tax benefit on equity based compensation plans decrease in deferred tax assets change in other working capital accounts 
table of contents significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively  due to the increased volume of business 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in deferred profit of million due to increased volume of shipments  an increase in accounts payable of million  and increases in accrued liabilities of million primarily due to vat and income taxes payable related to higher profit levels  and an increase in accrued compensation based on incentive based compensation 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year was million and consisted of a transfer to restricted cash and investments of million due to our guarantee agreement related to the obligations of our wholly owned subsidiary under the million credit agreement entered into during the quarter ended june  our obligations under the guarantee agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the guarantee agreement 
in addition  we purchased million for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of engineering equipment  and the purchase of intangible assets of intellectual property 
partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from the net sales of short term investments of million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was million consisting of million from the issuance of long term debt  million from the issuance of our common stock related to employee equity based plans  and million of excess tax benefits on equity based compensation plans  partially offset by stock repurchases of million 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a total price of million under board authorized repurchase programs which run through september  as of june  the total amount remaining available for repurchase under board authorizations was million 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares consistent with the board authorizations  the level of which will be determined by  including but not limited to  the needs of the business and the stock price and daily trading volumes of our stock 
given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r d and capital infrastructure 
based upon our current business outlook  our levels of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at june  are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations  investments  debt service requirements  and capital expenditures  through at least the next months 
in the longer term  liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we believe that  in the event of such requirements  we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives 
however  given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences  there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations  some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not  to make future payments under various contracts 
obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities and long term debt which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below 
our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below

the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june  under these arrangements and others 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges 
consignment inventories  which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses  are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined 
at june   vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory increased to million compared to million at june   due to the increased volume of our business 
restructuring liabilities our total restructuring reserves as of june  were million  which consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate long term debt 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk

the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 
we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues in japan that are denominated in japanese yen  certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in other currencies  and expenses related to our non us sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries local currency 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yen denominated assets and forecasted japanese yen denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies 
to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted japanese yen denominated revenues  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within months  and no later than months 
these foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized 
we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of japanese yen denominated net receivable balances 
the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables  recorded in other income and expense  assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was million 
the unrealized gain on the contracts on june   was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of million 
depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately would result in an unrealized gain of million 
these changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would

our outstanding long term debt of million bears interest at libor plus a spread ranging from to  depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the initial spread under the credit agreement is 
the principal payment of million is due on june  the fair value of long term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt
