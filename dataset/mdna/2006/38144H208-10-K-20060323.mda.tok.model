item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a more detailed description of this facility 
acquisition of goldleaf technologies  inc goldleaf on january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of goldleaf technologies  inc for million total consideration  consisting of million in cash and  in common shares  shares 
in conjunction with the goldleaf acquisition  we entered into employment agreements with four of goldleaf s executives  who received signing bonuses totaling million 
additionally  a total of million of common stock options with an exercise price of were granted to certain employees of goldleaf at closing 
the acquisition of goldleaf added three primary products to our suite of products automated clearing house ach origination and processing  financial institution website design and hosting  and remote capture deposit processing 
goldleaf currently services over  financial institutions in the united states and latin america 
industry background and market community financial institutions financial institutions have historically invested a significant amount of money in information technology systems 
technology firm idc estimates that banks  thrifts and credit unions in the united states spent approximately billion on information technology during and are expected to spend billion in our target market of community financial institutions ranges in size from de novo banks ie start up financial institutions to those with billion in assets 
we believe the number of these financial institutions totals approximately  we believe that these financial institutions  which have traditionally competed on the basis of personalized service  are facing increasing challenges to improve their operating efficiencies 
these challenges include the entrance of non traditional competitors  the compression of margins on traditional products and the convergence of financial products into a single institution 
recent legislation has allowed non traditional competitors  such as insurance companies and brokerage houses  to enter the market for traditional banking products 
because these competitors are able to subsidize traditional banking products with the revenues of other  higher profit products  financial institutions have experienced lower margins  increasing the pressure to reduce costs while continuing to offer an increasing array of consumer products and services 
at the same time  the cost and complexity of delivering these products and services has increased as the widespread introduction of new technology has forced financial institutions to expand their distribution channels to include atms  telephone banking  internet banking and wireless devices 
legislative changes have also accelerated the ability of financial institutions to offer wider ranges of products and services to their customers 
to distinguish themselves from competitors in this more competitive environment  banks and credit unions must accurately define and understand their specific markets  and be able to launch relevant products and services to those markets over tailored delivery channels 
these challenges are forcing financial institutions to examine how to conduct their business and service their customers most efficiently 
we believe that a technology solution must enable financial institutions to achieve a competitive advantage in their markets through improved customer service  competitive product offerings and lower costs 
in addition  financial institutions are required by federal law to evaluate the effectiveness of their information technology systems periodically 
this obligation  together with significant upgrades and phase outs of certain hardware by hardware providers  creates an ongoing need for institutions to evaluate replacement of their information technology systems 
small businesses dun bradstreet tracks approximately million small businesses in the us with less than million of annual sales 
we believe that approximately million of these businesses are potential prospects for businessmanager  medcashmanager  leasing  and remote capture based on their size  industry and receivables patterns 
the capital markets in which community financial institutions and small businesses operate are driven by several key forces including financing for small businesses  competitive forces  cost pressures  electronic commerce services and regulation and regulatory oversight 
we intend to be the single source provider that community financial institutions can turn to for assistance in all of these areas 
our products and services financial institution services in our financial institutions services segment  we provide products and services that help financial institutions serve their customers better  increase the efficiency of their operations  improve their competitive position in the marketplace  and boost their bottom line profitability  while satisfying regulatory requirements 
we are committed to the needs and interests of financial institutions and strive to upgrade  enhance or acquire complementary products and services to ensure that our customers receive the latest technology 
by taking advantage of our technology and operating solutions  our customers can improve their operating efficiencies without allocating the expenses and resources necessary to develop or maintain similar systems themselves 
our customers get the benefit of our products and services without having to maintain personnel to develop  update and run these systems and without having to make large up front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies 
core data processing we provide software and systems that meet our customers core data processing requirements  including general ledger  loan and deposit operations  financial accounting and reporting and customer information file maintenance 
our products and services provide superior flexibility and improve customer service throughout the financial institution 
most of our customers outsource their processing activities to our data center located in denver  colorado  while others install our systems in house and perform the processing functions themselves 
we are planning to build out an item processing and imaging center in atlanta  georgia during financial institutions can have our core systems installed and operate them in house using their own personnel 
most of our customers  however  use one of these systems through a service bureau arrangement 
in this case  we house and maintain the software at one of our data centers  and we process our customers data each business day 
this arrangement allows customers to focus on core competencies by outsourcing their data processing needs  which gives them access to our processing systems without the expense of maintaining in house processing operations 
item processing and check imaging increased technological development  regulatory changes and changing banking practices have created a demand for faster  more efficient electronic handling of bank documents  including checks 
the need to reduce labor  research time and the cost of postage has increased the demand for check imaging solutions 
the recent passage of the check clearing for the st century act check has removed certain legal obstacles to electronic check clearing  and has facilitated the use of check truncation and check imaging 
check imaging involves creating digital images through the use of a camera attached to a sorter 
as each check passes through the sorter  the camera takes its picture 
images of insufficient checks  stop payments and large dollar checks are presented online to bank operations staff for review 
financial institutions employ check imaging as part of their efforts to reduce operating costs and provide enhanced banking services to their customers 
in our item processing operations  we provide a turnkey outsourced solution for check imaging activities that provides our customers the ability to offer check imaging without a large capital expenditure 
our systems deliver a suite of check imaging products  including front and back imaging for customer statements  clearing and settlement  reconciliation and automated exception processing 
customers may print multiple check images in check sequence on a single page for inclusion in monthly statements  thereby reducing postage costs 
this system allows bank employees and bank customers to retrieve imaged checks on personal computers to facilitate signature verification and improve research 
we provide these services through our service bureau operations using rd party software systems 
ach origination and processing our goldleaf suite of ach origination and processing solutions helps financial institutions to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones by offering a service that lowers a customer company s processing costs  improves its cash flow and benefits its employees 
in turn  this service benefits the financial institution by increasing customer retention and satisfaction  generating interest income and reducing its back room processing costs 
goldleaf client gives financial institutions a brandable  internet based origination solution with online file delivery 
goldleaf client eliminates costly onsite software installation and frustrating modem file transmission by using the most cost effective delivery channel available the internet 
we believe goldleaf client delivers greater control for financial institutions with online administration and a user friendly solution for an unlimited number of commercial originators 
many institutions are eager to establish an ach origination program  but do not know how to get started 
this process can be simplified with our goldleaf manager processing solutions 
by leveraging over a decade of experience in software design and implementation  the transaction process is streamlined in a standardized manner  ensuring accuracy and reducing risk 
combined with our goldleaf client origination solutions  industry leading on site training  and toll free support for our financial institutions and originators  goldleaf manager can guide the implementation of an effective  profit producing program 
remote capture processing with the passing of the check legislation  financial institutions are now allowed to present and are legally required to accept image replacement documents irds if they meet the necessary legal requirements of check our remote capture product allows financial institutions to offer this solution to their commercial customers 
commercial customers benefit by no longer having to physically travel to a financial institution branch and deposit their checks 
instead  they can scan them and transmit their deposits to their financial institution electronically 
it saves the commercial customer time and potentially extends the cut off for receiving credit for deposited funds on that same day 
financial institutions are constantly striving to increase core customer deposits 
remote capture allows the financial institution to do that more easily by removing the geographic barrier 
with remote deposit  a financial institution can have a commercial customer outside of its branch footprint  because proximity to a branch is no longer necessary 
our remote capture product is completely web based  thus requiring no software installation 
businessmanager businessmanager enables financial institutions to manage accounts receivable financing  from the purchase of receivables from small businesses to the ongoing processing  billing and tracking of these receivables 
the financial institutions either process the transactions themselves or outsource this activity to our in house processing facility 
to automate the process further  we offer electronic links for the financial institutions and their small business customers through secure connections to our internet portal  businessmanager 
com 
we also provide integration with intuit s quickbooks  which many small businesses use 
our network of local sales consultants  or business development managers bdms  helps our client financial institutions develop new marketing strategies and facilitates the market penetration of businessmanager 
once a client financial institution contracts to use businessmanager  our bdms help the client financial institution design  implement and manage the sale of the businessmanager accounts receivable financing program to the client financial institution s small business customers and prospects 
using a database of likely small business customers of the program  the bdms generally work directly with the client financial institutions commercial loan officers to target and meet with qualified small business customers as part of the direct sale of the program to these businesses 
once the client financial institution has signed up a new small business customer  our bdms continue to work with the small business customer in conjunction with the financial institution loan officer to ensure proper implementation and post implementation support 
we also help design the appropriate procedures and controls to successfully implement businessmanager in order to minimize risk to our client financial institutions 
we typically provide our services to client financial institutions under exclusive long term contracts with terms ranging from three to five years with automatic renewals for a predefined term thereafter 
we receive initial fees for set up and thereafter receive participation fee payments equal to a percentage of every receivable purchased by the financial institutions from merchants on the program 
some contracts with financial institutions contain performance or deferred payment terms that we must satisfy to receive the initial set up fee from the financial institution and recognize revenue 
during  our network of client financial institutions purchased approximately billion of accounts receivable from approximately  small businesses 
medcashmanager medcashmanager is a proven program that enables banks to broaden their portfolio  generate fee income and increase core deposits 
creditworthy yet cash flow constrained medical facilities can get cash for accounts receivable every day by selling them to their financial institution 
the sales are at a discount on a full recourse basis  with a flexible cash collateral reserve 
medcashmanager matches each financial institution client with one of our bdms to help make programs successful 
credit and fraud insurance our insurance brokerage subsidiary offers two insurance products for the businessmanager and medcashmanager solutions 
both products are primarily underwritten by coface north america  a unit of the coface group  and one of the nation s major multi line insurers 
accounts receivable credit insurance protects the client bank and or its small business customers from default in payment of the receivable 
fraud insurance protects the client bank from two types of fraudulent acts by the client banks small business customers fraudulent invoices and diversion of customer payments 
financial institution leasing we offer a turn key leasing solution to community financial institutions that consists of lease structuring and pricing  lease equipment procurement  monthly processing and servicing and off lease equipment sales 
most community financial institutions have historically avoided the leasing business because of its complexity 
as a result  many of the community financial institutions customers are leasing equipment through other financing sources  including larger super regional and national financial institutions 
this puts the overall customer relationship at risk and the community financial institution has missed out on an additional revenue opportunity 
our solution allows a community financial institution to brand its own leasing program and offer a comprehensive leasing option to commercial businesses in its market 
the financial institution s involvement is limited to what it does best  which is loan money to finance the leased equipment based on the creditworthiness of the lessee 
the loan for the leased equipment is structured as a non recourse note payable to us and we in turn use the funds to acquire the leased asset and close the lease with the lessee 
the financial institution receives an origination fee based on the cost of the leased equipment as well as the interest yield on each non recourse note issued to finance each lease 
linemanager linemanager is an information tool  enabling asset based lenders to monitor the activity and quality of the assets that are the collateral for their loans 
we believe that much of the processing and reporting for asset based loans is currently done on a manual basis in cycles geared more toward the calendar than the actual underlying business activity 
linemanager  which is offered on an application service provider  or asp  basis automates and electronically updates the borrowing base in a virtual real time environment 
linemanager brings together in an on line environment data drawn directly from a debtor s accounting system with parameters set up in our system by the financial institution 
because the data exchange and reporting downloads can be done at almost any time  we believe that we give asset based lenders access to higher quality audit information while debtors have a lower cost of administration and compliance for their outstanding loan balances 
lendingnetwork our lendingnetwork offers outside the box financing from a group of more than commercial lenders in the industry 
businesses facing financial hurdles may need to use non traditional collateral  yet they have challenges common to all businesses maximizing cash flow  meeting payroll  continuing operations  and managing seasonal fluctuations

retail inventory management rmsa for many small retailers  their most critical success factor is inventory management 
purchasing the right stock items and in the appropriate quantities enables the retailer to avoid overstocking and under stocking  both of which can adversely affect the retailer s cash flow and operations results 
large chain retailers  which have greater resources than local or regional retailers  usually can employ their own full time in house staffs to perform inventory forecasting 
rmsa s primary objective is to provide this support to local and regional retail businesses 
we believe that between  and  retail businesses fit the profile of a rmsa client 
rmsa s inventory planning software freedom is unique in the industry as a result of its ability to provide retailers with a ten month forecast of inventory needs based on a bottom up approach to planning 
rmsa s system looks at the performance of individual classifications of inventory in each store  as opposed to most inventory management services  which are top down systems 
top down plans base inventory needs on the overall company targets  as opposed to looking at individual store performance 
strategy our objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically as well as through acquisitions 
the key components of our business strategy are to expand into new customers and new geographies 
we now provide a full suite of products and services to the financial institutions marketplace

as of march  we offer products and services to over  financial institutions 
build recurring revenue 
we enter into contracts with customers to provide services that meet their ongoing information technology needs 
we provide ongoing software support for our in house customers 
additionally  we provide data processing for our outsourcing customers on contracts that typically extend for periods of three to five years 
acquire products or services that are complementary to our existing products and services 
we will continue to acquire products or services that our customers require or that add additional customers  geographies or relationships 
maximize economies of scale 
our goal is to develop and maintain a sufficiently large client base to create economies of scale  enabling us to provide value priced products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins 
attract and retain capable employees 
we believe attracting and retaining high quality employees is essential to our continued growth and success 
sales and marketing financial institution services at march   our financial institutions sales team is composed of approximately sales representatives  product specialists and others who sell certain of our products but act as referral agents to sales specialists in other areas 
this allows us to capitalize on the experienced sales force that we employ to assist in cross selling products and services to existing clients 
in addition  we have approximately business development managers who focus on merchants which allows for cross selling opportunities for our financial institution sales team 
our marketing efforts consist of sponsorship and attendance at trade shows  email newsletters  print media advertisement placements  telemarketing and national and regional marketing campaigns 
we also conduct a user group meeting which enables us to keep in close contact with our customers and demonstrate new products and services to them 
our marketing efforts also include obtaining referrals and endorsements from our customers and various banking related organizations including the bankers banks  the independent community bankers association and the american bankers association 
dedicated sales forces  inside sales teams  and technical sales support teams conduct our sales efforts for our two market segments and are overseen by regional sales managers 
our dedicated sales executives are responsible for sales activities focused on acquiring new core customers 
our account executives nurture long term relationships with our client base and cross sell our complementary products and services 
our inside sales force markets specific complementary products and services to our existing customers 
we also have a dedicated sales force responsible for new customers for our acquired businesses targeted outside our core customer base 
all sales force personnel have responsibility for a specific territory 
the sales support teams write business proposals and contracts and prepare responses to requests for proposal regarding our software and hardware solutions 
all of our sales professionals receive a base salary and performance based commission compensation

our international sales have accounted for less than of our total revenues in each of the three years ended december    and retail planning services we sell and market our retail planning services through consultants and analysts located throughout the united states and canada

our consultants and analysts pursue sales and service opportunities in all fifty states 
leads are acquired for rmsa through trade shows  direct mail campaigns  and our alliances 
competition financial institution services general 
the market for companies that provide technology solutions to financial institutions is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  and we expect increased competition from both existing competitors and companies that enter our existing or future markets 
numerous companies supply competing products and services  and many of these companies specialize in one or more of the services that we offer or intend to offer to our customers 
financial institution product and service offerings other than businessmanager 
in our financial institution services business  we compete with several national and regional companies including fiserv  inc  jack henry associates  inc  open solutions  inc  john h 
harland company  and fidelity national financial  inc many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  technical and other resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our services include price  quality and reliability of service  degree of product and service integration  ease of use and service features 
there has been significant consolidation among providers of information technology products and services to financial institutions  and we believe this consolidation will continue in the future 
businessmanager 
in our receivables financing product offering  the market for small business financial services continues to be intensely competitive  fragmented and rapidly changing 
we believe that we compete effectively as a result of our highly trained and motivated sales force as well as the functionality of businessmanager 
we face primary competition from companies offering products to financial institutions similar to businessmanager 
only a limited number of companies offer similar comprehensive solutions  including marketing on behalf of the client financial institution 
we believe that private business is the largest of such companies in terms of revenue  number of client financial institutions and size of our dedicated sales force 
we believe that other firms typically offer software  but not sales support to the financial institution 
we compete with financial institutions that use their internal information technology departments to develop proprietary systems or purchase software from third parties to offer similar services to small businesses 
we also compete with providers of traditional sources of financing to small businesses such as lines of credit  amortizing loans and factoring 
many financial institutions and other traditional providers of financing are much larger and more established than we are 
most providers of traditional sources of financing and financial institutions that have already established relationships with small businesses may be able to leverage their relationships to discourage these customers from using our businessmanager solution or persuade them to replace our products with their products 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the accounts receivable financing market  as new products and technologies are introduced and as new competitors enter the market  some of which may market via the internet 
retail planning services we compete primarily with other consulting and planning firms in the retail inventory area 
in addition  many larger retail firms will have in house forecasting and inventory management groups 
we expect that competition could increase as new consulting and planning firms attempt to enter the retail forecasting market  or other retailers bring inventory planning in house 
this competition could result in price reductions  lower profit margins  increases in technology investment or loss of our market share  all of which could materially adverse effects on our business  financial and operating results 
government regulation the financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation 
our current and prospective customers operate in markets that are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision 
we must ensure that our products and services operate within the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers 
we are not chartered by the office of the comptroller of the currency or any other regulatory body 
some of our services are subject to examination by state and federal regulators under the bank service company act 
who have the authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews 
in addition  independent auditors perform an annual review of our operations to provide internal control evaluations for our clients auditors and regulators 
beginning july   financial institutions were required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the gramm leach bliley act 
these regulations place restrictions on financial institutions use of non public personal information 
all financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institutions to share information with non affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions 
as a provider of services to financial institutions  we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will adequately protect our proprietary rights or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
employees at march   we employed people 
we have approximately employees involved in direct sales  marketing and business development activities 
item a 
risk factors this section summarizes certain risks  among others  that shareholders and prospective investors should consider 
many of these risks are discussed in other sections of this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
additional risks of which we are presently unaware or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations and hinder our financial performance 
risks related to our operations we have a limited operating history as a combined company under a new ceo 
our chief executive officer  mr 
lynn boggs  joined us in december when we merged with captiva 
our previous chief executive officer  henry baroco  became our president and chief operating officer 
we acquired goldleaf and ptc in january our new management and our substantially expanded range of products and services make it extremely difficult to project our future performance 
therefore  investors will be unable to make historic comparisons regarding our prior operations 
furthermore  given this insufficient combined operating history  there can be no assurance that we will achieve any of our objectives 
if we are unable to integrate the business operations of captiva  ptc and goldleaf into our business operations  we will not realize the anticipated potential benefits from the acquisitions and our business could be adversely affected 
the acquisitions of captiva  ptc and goldleaf involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently 
successful integration of the acquired operations with ours will depend on our ability to consolidate operations  systems and procedures  eliminate redundancies and reduce costs 
if we are unable to do so  we will not realize the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisitions and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
difficulties could include the loss of key employees and customers  the disruption of our and the acquired entities ongoing businesses and possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies 
our integration of the acquired entities  including the integration and testing of internal controls and procedures that may be required with respect to these entities to comply with certain sec rules and regulations as they become effective  may be complex and time consuming 
additionally  a number of factors beyond our control could prevent us from realizing any efficiencies and cost savings we expect 
if the combined company experiences losses  we could experience difficulty meeting our business plan and our stock price could be negatively affected 
we may not be able to achieve profitability as we implement our business plan for the combined entity 
any failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business operations and financial results will suffer 
we anticipate that the combined company will incur significant product development  administrative  and sales and marketing expenses 
any failure to increase revenues significantly would also harm our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  our debt to equity ratio has increased and exposes us to greater risks 
to finance the cash portion of the acquisition consideration  our debt has increased by approximately million since september  this additional leverage may increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the financial technology industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the possible financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds 
competition  restrictions under our credit facility  market conditions and other factors may impede our ability to acquire other businesses and may inhibit our growth 
we anticipate that we may derive a portion of our future growth through acquisitions 
the success of this strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  reach agreements to acquire these companies  obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms and successfully integrate the operations of these businesses 
in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities  we may compete with other companies that have similar growth strategies 
many of these competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
this competition may render us unable to acquire businesses that could improve our growth or expand our operations 
our acquisitions could result in integration difficulties  unexpected expenses  diversion of management s attention and other negative consequences 
our growth strategy is partly based on making acquisitions 
we plan to continue to acquire complementary businesses  products and services 
we must integrate the technology  products and services  operations  systems and personnel of acquired businesses with our own and attempt to grow the acquired businesses as part of our company 
the integration of other businesses is a complex process and places significant demands on our management  financial  technical and other resources 
the successful integration of businesses we have recently acquired and may acquire in the future is critical to our future success  and if we are unsuccessful in integrating these businesses  our financial and operating performance could suffer 
the risks and challenges associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses include we may be unable to centralize and consolidate our financial  operational and administrative functions with those of the businesses we acquire  our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  we may be unable to retain and motivate key employees of an acquired company  we may enter markets in which we have little or no prior direct experience  litigation  indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses  the costs necessary to complete integration may exceed our expectations or outweigh some of the intended benefits of the transactions we close  we may be unable to maintain the customers or goodwill of an acquired business  and the costs necessary to improve or replace the operating systems  products and services of acquired businesses may exceed our expectations 
we may be unable to integrate our acquisitions with our operations on schedule or at all 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur large accounting charges or other expenses in connection with acquisitions or that our acquisitions will result in cost savings or sufficient revenues or earnings to justify our investment in  or our expenses related to  these acquisitions 
as a result of the recent acquisitions  some of the acquired entities current clients may choose to discontinue their business relationship with us 
although we anticipate that the acquired entities existing customers will view the acquisitions as a benefit  some of the acquired entities existing customers may decide to discontinue their business relationship with us because of the acquisitions 
we may be unable to manage growth of our business 
we intend to grow our business in size and complexity 
if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
any new sustained growth will place a significant strain on our management systems and operational resources 
we anticipate that new sustained growth  if any  will require us to recruit  hire and retain new managerial  finance  sales  marketing and support personnel 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in recruiting  hiring or retaining such personnel 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to maintain and improve operational  financial  and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
if we begin to grow  we cannot be certain that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
in addition  one element of our growth strategy is to actively evaluate and pursue strategic alliances with businesses that are complementary to our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to integrate fully any such alliances with our existing operations or otherwise implement our growth strategy 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from receivables financing 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from receivables financing  the majority of which flows through businessmanager 
historically  approximately of our consolidated revenues derived from license fees from new agreements with client financial institutions and approximately derive from participation fees based on accounts receivables purchased by our financial institution clients from small businesses 
we expect to continue to derive significant revenues from this product and related services 
if the total revenues we derive from businessmanager decline  our other products or services may not be sufficient to replace that lost revenue  so any events that adversely affect businessmanager could adversely affect our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to successfully market and sell businessmanager to both financial institutions and their small business customers or that problems will not develop with businessmanager that could materially affect our business 
we may be unable to promote businessmanager to new and existing small business customers 
other than the initial contract fee and a small annual support fee  we do not generate any income from financial institutions contracting to use businessmanager unless small businesses finance their accounts receivable through our client financial institutions 
if we and our client financial institutions cannot retain existing clients and convince potential small business customers of the benefits of businessmanager  such businesses will not continue to use or initiate use of our products and services 
since small business customers of our client financial institutions are the foundation of our business  their unwillingness to use businessmanager could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be unable to market our products and services successfully to new client financial institutions or to retain current client financial institutions 
our success depends to a large degree on our ability to convince prospective client financial institutions to use our products 
failure to maintain market acceptance  retain clients or successfully expand our offered services could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have spent  and will continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers about our products and services 
even with these educational efforts  however  we may not be able to maintain market acceptance and client retention 
in addition  as we continue to offer new products and expand our services  existing and potential client financial institutions or their small business customers may be unwilling to accept the new products or services 
the loss of our chief executive officer or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
mr 
g 
lynn boggs  our chief executive officer  has substantial experience with our operations and our industry 
although we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
boggs and we have an employment agreement with him  our customer and marketing relationships would likely be impaired and our business would likely suffer if we lost the services of mr 
boggs  or of any other executive officer or key employee  for any reason 
we may be unable to attract  hire  or retain enough qualified sales and marketing personnel 
if we are unable to implement our growth plans and strategies  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
an important part of our sales strategy is to attract  hire and retain qualified sales and marketing personnel to maintain and expand our marketing capabilities 
because competition for experienced sales and marketing personnel is intense  we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain enough qualified sales and marketing personnel or that those we do hire will be able to generate new business at the rate we currently expect 
if we are unable to hire and retain enough qualified sales and marketing personnel  or those we hire are not as productive as we expect  we may not be able to implement our sales plans 
the failure to execute our growth plans may affect our ability to remain a publicly traded company 
part of our business strategy involves growth either through the development of new products or the formation of strategic alliances 
these growth plans will require a substantial expenditure of time  money and other valuable resources 
not only does this take resources away from our current business  but we face the risk that our strategy will not ultimately be successful 
in such event  it is possible that the continued costs associated with being a public traded company will outweigh the anticipated organic growth of our current business  which could result in our being delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market or engaging in a going private transaction 
our plans to expand the number of products and services offered may not be successful and may lower our overall profit margin 
part of our business strategy is to expand our offering of products and services 
we believe that we can provide these services profitably  but such services may generate a lower profit margin than our current products and services 
as a result  by offering additional products and services we may lower our overall profit margin 
although gross revenues would likely increase  the lowering of our profit margin may be viewed negatively by the stock market  possibly resulting in a reduction in our stock price 
as stated elsewhere in this report  we have acquired several new products to offer to our customer base 
although we believe that markets and customers exist for this expansion  there can be no assurances that we can successfully sell these products at a rate sufficient for us to recover our investment 
we may be unable to compete in the financial services market 
the market for community minded financial institutions and small business financial services is highly competitive 
we face primary competition from a number of companies that offer to financial institutions products similar to our own  and many of these competitors are much larger and have many more resources than we do 
we also compete with financial institutions that use their internal information technology departments to develop proprietary systems or purchase software from third parties to offer similar services 
in addition  we compete with traditional sources of financial services to small businesses such as lines of credit  amortizing loans and factoring 
many financial institutions and other traditional providers of financing are much larger and more established than we are  have significantly greater resources  generate more revenues and have greater name recognition 
we cannot be certain our competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those that we have developed or adapt more quickly to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing small business requirements 
in addition  as we expand our service offerings  we may begin competing with companies with whom we have not previously competed 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower profit margins and loss of our market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately 
our success and ability to compete are dependent largely upon our proprietary technology 
third party claims against our proprietary technology could negatively affect our business 
we cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to deter misappropriation or independent development of our technology by others 
in addition  we cannot be certain that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future or  if infringement claims are asserted  that such claims will be resolved in our favor 
although we are not currently subject to any dispute either protecting our proprietary technology or asserting a third party claim against our proprietary technology  any infringement claims resolved against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the failure of our network infrastructure and equipment would have a material effect on our business 
failure of our network infrastructure and equipment  on which our business depends  as well as the occurrence of significant human error  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems  could halt our services  damage network equipment and result in substantial expense to repair or replace damaged equipment 
in addition  the failure of our telecommunications providers to supply the necessary services could also interrupt our business  in particular  the application hosting and transaction processing services we offer to our client financial institutions via secure internet connections 
the inability to supply these services to our customers could negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may also harm our reputation 
we rely on the technological infrastructure of our client financial institutions and their individual customers 
the success of the products and services we offer depends  to a degree  on the technological infrastructure and equipment of our client financial institutions and their small business customers 
we provide application hosting and transaction processing services to our clients that require some level of integration with the client s technological infrastructure 
proper technical integration between our clients and us is critical to our being able to provide the services we have agreed to provide 
a failure of a client s infrastructure for any reason could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results 
because our business involves the electronic storage and transmission of data  security breaches and computer viruses could adversely affect us 
our online transaction processing systems electronically store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers 
the difficulty of securely storing confidential information electronically has been a significant issue in conducting electronic transactions 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to alleviate problems caused by breaches or viruses 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims  litigation and other possible liabilities 
any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers 
increased fraud committed by small businesses and increased uncollectible accounts of small businesses may adversely affect our business 
small business customers from time to time fraudulently submit artificial receivables to our clients using our products and services 
in addition  customers from time to time keep cash payments that are mistakenly remitted to the small business when those payments should actually be remitted directly to the clients 
our clients are also susceptible to uncollectible accounts from small business customers 
many of our clients purchase insurance through us to insure against these risks 
if the number and amount of fraudulent or bad debt claims increase  our clients may decide to reduce or terminate their use of our products and services  reducing our ability to attract and retain revenue producing clients 
further  our insurance carrier providing coverage for the insurance products may increase rates or cancel coverage  reducing our ability to produce that revenue and reducing our margins on that business 
errors and omissions by our employees at our service center and any problems with systems or software may expose us to claims and loss of business 
we currently conduct core processing services for some of our financial institution clients and expect to grow this part of our business in the future 
acting as a processor for clients may expose us to claims about the quality of those services 
our employees may make errors  or technical or other events beyond our control may occur 
these errors or events may adversely affect our business and financial results 
access to capital for growth and new product introduction or acquisitions may not be available 
a significant part of our growth plans rest on the development of new products  strategic acquisitions and the formation of strategic alliances for our primary products 
to execute the plans as we intend  we will need additional capital 
market conditions at the time we need this capital may preclude access to new capital of any kind or to capital on terms acceptable to us 
any of these developments could significantly hinder our ability to add new products or services 
we are subject to government and private regulation  and an increase in regulatory requirements or tax burdens could adversely affect our business 
various federal and state regulatory agencies examine our data processing operations from time to time 
these agencies can make findings or recommendations regarding various aspects of our operations  and we generally must follow those recommendations to continue our data processing operations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  our operations and processing revenues could be negatively affected 
in addition  our business is subject to review by these regulatory agencies 
if we do not conduct our business in compliance with applicable regulatory standards  our business and operations could be adversely affected 
if our processing center or communications network suffers a systems failure or interruption  we may face customer service issues and be liable for damage suffered by our customers 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our processing center  network infrastructure and equipment 
damage to our systems or equipment  or those of third parties that we use  may be caused by natural disasters  human error  power and telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
although we do have an off site back up server  we have only one processing center 
interruption in our processing or communications services could delay transfers of our customers data  or damage or destroy the data 
any of these occurrences could result in lawsuits or loss of customers and may also harm our reputation 
if our products and services contain errors  we may lose customers and revenues and be subject to claims for damages 
our new products and services  and enhancements to our existing products and services  may have undetected errors or failures  or could fail to achieve market acceptance  despite testing by our current and potential customers and by us 
if we discover errors after we have introduced a new or updated product to the marketplace  we could experience  among other things delayed or lost revenues while we correct the errors  a loss of customers or delay in market acceptance  and additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development 
our agreements with our customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
these provisions may not be effective because of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances  or unfavorable judicial decisions 
if our products and services fail to function properly  we could be subject to product liability claims  which could result in increased litigation expense  damage awards and harm to our business reputation 
technological changes may reduce the demand for our products and services or render them obsolete 
the introduction of new technologies and financial products and services can render existing technology products and services obsolete 
we expect other vendors to introduce new products and services  as well as enhancements to their existing products and services  that will compete with our current products and services 
to be successful  we must anticipate evolving industry trends  continue to apply advances in technology  enhance our existing products and services and develop or acquire new products and services to meet the demands of our customers 
we may not be successful in developing  acquiring or marketing new or enhanced products or services that respond to technological change or evolving customer needs 
we may also incur substantial costs in developing and employing new technologies 
if we fail to adapt to changes in technologies  we could lose customers and revenues  and fail to attract new customers or otherwise realize the benefits of costs we incur 
risks related to our industry we are not diversified and depend on a single industry 
our financial institution products and services are used almost exclusively by financial institutions  primarily community financial institutions 
as a result  we are subject to the risks of providing services for a single industry 
due to our dependence upon the banking industry  any events that adversely affect the industry in general and community financial institutions in particular  such as changed or expanded financial institution regulations  could adversely affect us and our operations 
a downturn in this industry would have a substantial negative impact on our business and operations 
financial institutions are subject to industry consolidation  and we may lose customers with little notice 
the financial institution industry is prone to consolidations that result from mergers and acquisitions 
other financial institutions that do not use our products and services may acquire our existing customers and then convert them to competing products and services 
most of our contracts provide for a charge to the customer for early termination of the contract without cause  but these charges are insufficient to replace the recurring revenues that we would have received if the financial institution had continued as a customer 
the banking industry is highly regulated  and changes in banking regulations could negatively affect our business 
our financial institution customers are subject to the supervision of several state and federal government regulatory agencies 
regulation of financial institutions  especially with respect to receivable services such as businessmanager  can indirectly affect our business 
the use of our products by financial institutions is currently in compliance with or is not subject to banking regulations 
these regulatory agencies  however  could change or impose new regulations on financial institutions  including modifying the financial institutions ability to offer products and services similar to ours to their small business customers 
these new regulations  if any  could prevent or lessen the use of our services by financial institutions 
risks of owning our stock lightyear owns a majority of the company s stock and therefore effectively controls the company s management and policies 
lightyear  through its holdings of our series a and series c preferred stock  and warrants convertible into common stock  beneficially owns  in the aggregate  approximately of the our common stock 
as a result of lightyear s investment in us  we have agreed to use our best efforts to cause four lightyear nominees to serve on our board of directors  which is composed of seven directors 
four lightyear nominees are currently serving on our board 
in addition  we are required to obtain the approval of holders of the series a preferred stock before taking certain actions 
the holder of the series a preferred stock has certain pre emptive rights to participate in future equity financings 
in view of its large percentage of ownership and its rights as the holder of the series a preferred stock  lightyear effectively controls our management and policies  such as the appointment of new management and the approval of any other action requiring the approval of the shareholders  including any amendments to our charter  a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a merger 
in addition  lightyear has registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock that it beneficially owns 
any decision by lightyear to exercise such registration rights and to sell a significant amount of its shares in the public market could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not be able to use the tax benefit from our operating losses 
at december   we had available federal net operating losses  or nols  of approximately million that will expire beginning in if not used 
we acquired approximately million of these nols in connection with our merger with towne services  inc section of the internal revenue code limits the amount of nols available to us in any given year 
this limitation permits us to realize only a small portion of the potential tax benefit of the nols each year 
we estimate that we will be able to realize approximately million of the towne services nols  which we recorded as a million deferred tax asset at december  we may be unable to use all of these nols before they expire 
our charter  bylaws and tennessee law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our charter  bylaws and tennessee law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us 
for example  our charter provides for a staggered board of directors  restricts the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting and prohibits shareholder action by written consent 
our bylaws allow the board to expand its size and fill any vacancies without shareholder approval 
in addition  the tennessee business corporation act contains the tennessee business combination act and the tennessee greenmail act  which impose restrictions on shareholder actions 
future sales of shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership of our current investors and may negatively affect our stock price 
to carry out our growth strategies  we plan to acquire other businesses and products using a combination of our stock and cash  and we may also sell additional shares of our stock to raise money for expanding our operations 
the issuance of shares of our common stock in either case could dilute the ownership interest of current investors 
if our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march    shares of common stock are outstanding   shares of common stock are issuable to lightyear under the warrants it holds   shares of common stock can be acquired on the exercise of outstanding options   shares of common stock are reserved for future issuance under stock option plans and up to  common shares could be issued as contingent consideration related to the captiva merger 
our issuance of additional shares of common stock on the exercise of warrants or options would also dilute the ownership interest of current investors

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from six main sources participation fees and insurance brokerage fees earned on client financial institution purchases of small business accounts receivable  software license fees from new client financial institutions 
retail planning services  core data processing and image processing  maintenance fees and other revenues  comprised primarily of fees received for insurance brokerage services  paper based form sales  software maintenance  medical  and processing services  and leasing revenues there are two types of participation fees 
the first type is earned upon the client financial institution s initial purchase of a small business accounts receivable during the first days on our program 
the second type is an ongoing participation fee earned from subsequent period purchases 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the receivables that a client financial institution purchases from its small business customers during each month 
the second type of fee is a smaller percentage of the ongoing receivables purchased 
participation fees are recognized as earned  which is based upon the transaction dates of financial institution purchases from its small business customers 
software license fees for businessmanager consist of two components the license fee and customer training and support fee 
these are one time fees that we receive upon the initial licensing of our businessmanager program to a community financial institution 
our license agreements are executed with terms ranging from three to five years and are renewable for subsequent terms 
some agreements contain performance or deferred payment terms that must be met in order for us to receive payment and recognize revenue 
we recognize revenues from the license fee once we have met the terms of the customer agreement 
the customer training and support fee are recognized ratably over a four month service period subsequent to the activation of the license agreement 
revenue recognition rules for up front fees are complex and require interpretation and judgment on the part of management 
management completed a thorough analysis of and new customer licenses and concluded that all services related to the up front fees were completed in approximately four months 
as such  effective january   we changed the estimated service period for recognition of the up front license fee from a twelve month to a four month revenue recognition period 
we believe that this practice most accurately portrays the economic reality of the transactions 
software license fees also include the sale and delivery of application software systems contracted with us by the customer 
we license our proprietary software products under standard license agreements that typically provide the customer with a non exclusive  non transferable right to use the software on a single computer and for a single financial institution location 
the customer also pays an annual maintenance fee to have the right to continue using the software and to receive updates from us as we make them available 
additionally  since  we have brokered  through our private business insurance subsidiary  credit and fraud insurance products from a national insurance company 
we earn fees based on a percentage of the premium that is paid to the insurance company 
these commission revenues are recognized at the time receivable fundings covered by credit and fraud insurance policies are purchased by our financial institution customers 
retail planning services revenue is generated from fees charged primarily for providing inventory merchandising and forecasting information for specialty retail stores and ancillary services related to these products 
rmsa uses proprietary software to process sales and inventory transactions and provide the merchandising forecasting information 
we recognize revenues as the transactions occur and merchandising and forecasting services are performed 
core data processing and image processing services are primarily offered on an outsourced basis through our service bureau but are also offered through licenses for use by the institution on an in house basis 
support and services fees are generated from implementation services contracted with us by the customer  ongoing support services to assist the customer in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software  and from providing outsourced data processing services 
outsourcing services are performed through our data and item centers 
revenues from outsourced item and data processing are derived from monthly usage fees typically under multi year contracts with our customers 
as a result of the kvi capital  inc kvi acquisition  we are an equipment lessor 
as such  we account for our leasing business in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
sfas no 
requires us to evaluate each lease transaction and determine whether it qualifies as a sales type  direct financing  leveraged  or operating lease 
our leases fall into two of those catagories direct financing and operating leases 
for direct financing leases  the investment in direct financing leases caption consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments due during the remaining term of the lease and unguaranteed residual value of the leased asset 
the difference between the total above and the cost of the leased asset is then recorded as unearned income 
unearned income is amortized to income over the lease term as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
for leases classified as operating leases  the leased asset is recorded at cost and depreciated by us 
lease payments are recorded as rent income during the period earned 
maintenance fees and other revenues include several ancillary products and services we provide to client financial institutions 
annual software maintenance fees are generated from our client financial institutions starting on the first anniversary date of the businessmanager license agreement and annually thereafter 
these revenues are recognized ratably over a twelve month period beginning on the first anniversary date of the agreement 
we also provide a standard set of forms that client financial institutions may purchase and use in the normal course of administering the businessmanager program 
revenues related to these forms are recognized in the period that they are shipped to the client financial institution 
we also have some industry focused applications for the medical and dental markets 
monthly transaction processing fees include charges for electronic processing  statement rendering and mailing  settling payments  recording account changes and new accounts  leasing and selling point of sale terminals  telephone and software support services  rental fees and collecting debts 
software development costs 
software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products to be sold or marketed are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after such time  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
also  we capitalize the cost of internally used software when application development begins in accordance with aicpa sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this is generally defined as the point when research and development has been completed  the project feasibility established  and management has approved a development plan 
many of the costs capitalized for internally used software are related to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems 
these costs are only capitalized if the development costs will result in specific additional functionality of the existing system  and are capitalized at the point that application development begins 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  generally three years 
the key assumptions and estimates that must be made relative to this accounting policy center around determining when technological feasibility has been achieved and whether the project being undertaken is one that will be marketable or enhance the marketability of an existing product for externally marketed software and whether the project will result in additional functionality for internal use software projects 
management consults monthly with all project managers to ensure that the scope and expected results of each project are understood by management in order to make a judgment on whether it meets the requirements outlined in the authoritative accounting literature 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the asset and liability method  meaning that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we evaluate our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes for us primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards nols  which require considerable judgment as to the ultimate realizability 
for us  this judgment relies largely on the fact that we expect to have sufficient taxable income in future years that will allow for full utilization of the nols recorded by us 
the other key assumption impacting the amount of nols recorded by us as a deferred tax asset is the estimated restrictions in usage due to section of the internal revenue service tax code 
section is very complex requiring significant expertise and professional judgment in order to properly evaluate its effect on our usable nols 
we use an independent public accounting firm to assist with this evaluation and believe that the limitations required by section have been appropriately considered in arriving at our deferred tax asset for nols 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 
our business combinations require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with sfas no 
in general  we determine the fair values based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities substantiated by us and valuations by independent third party appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets 
these assets are being amortized over the expected economic lives of the assets  generally ranging from three to ten years 
we are required to evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets that are being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
we are also required to test the carrying amount of these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we performed an annual impairment test for goodwill as of december  the annual impairment analysis resulted in no indication of impairment and therefore no write offs of goodwill were recorded in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of the identified consolidated statement of operations items to total revenues 
year ended december  revenues participation fees software license retail planning services insurance brokerage fees maintenance and other total revenues operating expenses general and administrative selling and marketing research and development amortization other operating total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income income before income taxes income tax provision net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  participation fees 
participation fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the total funding through our businessmanager program 
total receivables funded through businessmanager declined to billion in compared to billion in this decreased funding was primarily the result of fewer merchants funding through our businessmanager program during as compared to the decline is a result of merchants leaving the program faster than they are being replenished through new sales 
merchant attrition rates are stable  however  new merchant sales were lower than necessary in order to increase total participation fees 
as a percentage of total revenue  participation fees decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year earlier period 
software license 
software license fees increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the change in accounting estimate  resulting in faster revenue recognition in than in previous years 
total new licensed financial institutions decreased in compared to due to the revenue recognition deferral policies in place for new license agreements discussed elsewhere in this report  however  license fee revenues actually increased 
software license fees accounted for and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
retail planning services 
retail planning services revenue decreased to million for as compared to million for the decrease of  or  from is a result of a decline in point of sale customer support revenues from  in to  in as well as a decline in monthly forecast service fees of  the decline in monthly forecast service fees is due to a decrease in the number of forecast clients 
point of sale customers support revenue declined due to the fact that the point of sale system support services offered relate to a point of sales system that is no longer being marketed  upgraded and sold 
as a result  some existing point of sale support customers purchased new point of sale systems from other vendors and moved their support services elsewhere 
as a percentage of total revenues  retail planning services accounted for during compared to in insurance brokerage fees 
insurance brokerage fees decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the lower total receivables funding volume discussed above 
insurance brokerage fees accounted for and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
maintenance and other 
maintenance and other revenue increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to several items including the acquisitions of kvi capital and captiva  as well as the launch of a new product called free checking  and finally  organized growth in our lending network revenues 
the leasing business ie  kvi capital contributed  of revenue in  while our core processing business ie  captiva contributed  of revenue in the new free checking product revenues totaled approximately  and the growth in our lending network revenues totaled  additionally  we launched another new product  medcash manager  in early  which contributed  of revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  maintenance and other revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  total revenues 
as a result of the foregoing revenue categories  total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses include the cost of our executive  finance  human resources  information services  support services  administrative functions and general operations

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  investment from shareholders  and amounts drawn on outstanding credit facilities 
during  our operating activities provided cash of million 
we used million in our investing activities as a result of fixed asset and software development additions  as well as acquisition of kvi capital and captiva 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for we entered into the bank of america credit facility on january  the bank of america credit facility was secured by a pledge of all of our assets and contains financial and non financial covenants 
the bank of america credit facility included a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving line of credit of up to million for a total facility of up to million 
the revolving line of credit included a million letter of credit sub limit 
as of december   no amount was outstanding under the bank of america credit facility 
on december   this facility was amended by converting the entire facility to a revolving line of credit and reducing the total size of the facility to million 
as of december   no amount was outstanding under the bank of america credit facility 
the bank of america credit facility was slated to mature on march   but it was replaced by the amended and restated credit facility discussed below 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial and non financial covenants contained in the bank of america credit facility throughout on december   we issued a million senior subordinated note to lightyear lightyear note as approved by our shareholders during a special shareholders meeting on that same date 
as discussed below  the lightyear note was converted into shares of our series c preferred stock on january  on january   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america amended and restated credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility is for a total of million  has a two year term and is secured by a pledge of all of the company s assets 
the amended and restated credit facility total of million consists of two term loans totaling million and a revolving credit line totaling million 
the million term a loan has a maturity date of january  the million term b loan has a maturity date of no later than july  the revolving credit line matures on january  the term a loan has scheduled repayment terms as follows march and june   quarter september and december   quarter thereafter until maturity  quarter the amended and restated credit facility includes certain restrictive financial covenants  measured quarterly  relating to net worth  maximum annual capital expenditures  funded debt to ebitda ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the agreement 
the facility also contains customary negative covenants  including but not limited to a prohibition on declaring and paying any cash dividends on any class of stock  including the series a  series b  and series c preferred shares outstanding 
in conjunction with this amended and restated credit facility  the lightyear fund  lp guaranteed the term b loan and exchanged its senior subordinated million note due on december  for  shares of our series c preferred stock 
therefore  the senior subordinated debt discussed above was converted to series c preferred shares on january  in the event that we are unable to repay the million term b loan by july  and lightyear is required to repay the term b loan on our behalf  we are obligated to issue new series d preferred shares to lightyear 
the series d preferred shares will carry a per annum dividend rate  will have a mandatory redemption date nine months from the date of issuance  and will require the issuance of  common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share 
we will also be required to pay a closing fee equal to of the amount repaid by the lightyear fund  lp to bank of america 
the series c preferred shares issued to lightyear have a mandatory redemption date of december  at million and have a annual dividend rate that increases to on june  the series c preferred shares do not carry any voting rights 
due to the mandatory redemption requirement  the series c preferred stock will be included in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to a working capital deficit of approximately  as of december  the change in working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of the current portion of long term debt by million  as well as a decrease in accrued liabilities of  plus increases in cash of  accounts receivable and other of  deferred taxes of  and prepaid and other current assets of  partially offset by a  increase in accounts payable 
the decrease in current portion of long term debt is a result of the lightyear note issuance described above  as well as the use of available cash balances to pay down on our revolving line of credit 
the decrease in accrued liabilities relates to a reduction in accrued severance expenses of we believe that the existing cash available  future operating cash flows and our amended and restated credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility throughout there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations or that we will remain in compliance with the new covenants 
non compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
the following is a schedule of our obligations and commitments for future payments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years after revolving line of credit operating leases senior subordinated note payable subsequently converted to series c preferred stock total contractual cash obligations standby letters of credit commitment we may  in the future  acquire businesses or products complementary to our business  although we cannot be certain that we will make any such acquisitions will be made 
the need for cash to finance additional working capital or to make acquisitions may cause us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot be certain that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that our need for higher levels of working capital will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after december  and therefore we have adopted sfas r effective january  sfas no 
r requires the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments awarded or liabilities incurred to be recognized in the financial statements 
compensation cost will be measured using a fair value based method over the period that the employee provides service in exchange for the award 
we anticipate using the black scholes option pricing model to determine the annual compensation cost related to share based payments under sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flow and reduce net financing cash outflow by offsetting and equal amounts 
as disclosed in note to of our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report  based on the current assumptions and calculations used  had we recognized compensation expense based on the fair value of awards of equity instruments  net income would have been increased by approximately  for the year ended december  this compensation expense is the after tax net effect of the stock based compensation expense determined using the fair value based method for all awards and stock based employee compensation included previously in reported net income under apb no 
sfas no 
r will apply to all awards granted after the effective date and to the unvested portion of existing option awards  as well as modifications  repurchases or cancellations of existing awards 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r for the year ending december   based upon the options outstanding as of february   is estimated to result in an increase in compensation expense of approximately  the actual impact of adopting sfas no 
r will change for the effect of potential future awards and actual option forfeitures which are not known at this time 
the impact of those future awards will vary depending on the timing  amount and valuation methods used for such awards  and our past awards are not necessarily indicative of such potential future awards 
seasonality we have generally realized lower revenues and income in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter of the year 
we believe that this is primarily due to a general slowdown in economic activity following the fourth quarter s holiday season and  more specifically  a decrease in purchased receivables by our client financial institutions 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparison cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
due to the relatively fixed nature of costs such as personnel  facilities and equipment costs  a revenue decline in a quarter will typically result in lower profitability for that quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
currently  our exposure relates primarily to our long term debt obligations pursuant to the amended and restated bank of america credit facility 
as of december   we did not have any significant market risks because its outstanding debts on that date had fixed interest rates
