the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and other documents filed by us from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel biological therapies for patients with cancer 
we are currently developing cell based cancer immunotherapies and oncolytic virus therapies to treat different types of cancer 
our clinical stage cancer programs involve cell or viral based products that have been genetically modified to impart disease fighting characteristics that are not found in conventional chemotherapeutic agents 
as part of our gvax cancer immunotherapy programs  we are conducting two phase clinical trials in prostate cancer and phase trials in each of pancreatic cancer and leukemia 
we initiated our phase clinical trials for gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer in july and june  each under a special protocol assessment spa with the united states food and drug administration fda 
in our oncolytic virus therapies program  which we are developing in part through a global alliance with novartis ag novartis  we initiated a phase clinical trial of cg in recurrent bladder cancer in april we also have other preclinical oncolytic virus therapy programs  including cg  evaluating potential therapies for multiple types of cancer 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  income taxes and stock based compensation to be critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived principally from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically includes upfront payments  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and license fees 
we evaluate whether the delivered element under these arrangements has value to our customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables that do not meet these criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for the purposes of revenue recognition 
up front payments up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable upfront license fees and other payments under collaboration agreements where the company continues involvement throughout development are deferred and recognized on a straight line or ratable method  unless we determine that another methodology is more appropriate 
during  and  the company recognized revenue from a non refundable upfront payment under our global alliance with novartis ag for the development of certain oncolytic virus therapies based upon when the underlying development expenses were incurred  rather than a ratable method  as we determined that the expense method was more appropriate for this agreement 
the revenues recorded under the novartis alliance 
table of contents approximated the related development expenses that were incurred in the respective periods 
the company recognizes cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred  as provided for under the terms of these agreements 
deferred revenue represents the portion of upfront payments received that has not been earned 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full upon achievement of the incentive milestone events in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of the company s research efforts or by events external to the company  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner 
as such  the incentive milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of an incentive milestone event  the company has no future performance obligations related to that payment 
license fees non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue upon execution of the technology licensing agreement when delivery has occurred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provision of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires recognition of deferred taxes to provide for temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the year in which the basis difference is expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets  when the realization of such deferred income tax assets cannot be determined to be more likely than not 
the company establishes accruals for tax contingencies when it believes that certain tax positions may be challenged and that our positions may not be fully sustained 
the company adjusts its tax contingency accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
in july  the irs issued to the company a notice of proposed adjustment nopa seeking to disallow million of net operating losses which were deducted for the fiscal year and seeking a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we responded to the nopa in september  disagreeing with the conclusions reached by the irs in the nopa and seeking to resolve this matter at the appeals level 
we recorded a liability of million for this and other federal and state tax contingencies  including estimated interest expense  at december  and accrued an additional million of interest related to these tax contingencies in the nature of these tax matters is uncertain and subject to change 
as a result  the amount of our liability for certain of these matters could exceed or be less than the amount of our current estimates  depending on the outcome of these matters 
if we are unsuccessful in defending the tax filing positions that were previously taken  then potentially the liability for federal and state tax contingencies could be significantly higher than the million that has been recorded as of december  an outcome of such matters different than previously estimated could materially impact our financial position or results of operations in the year of resolution 
the company continues to believe that its tax positions comply with all applicable tax laws  and the company continues to vigorously defend against the nopa using all administrative and legal processes available 
income tax benefits previously recorded have been based on a determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against these deferred tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered anticipated future taxable income  including taxable income from sales of abgenix common stock  and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
certain of these determinations require judgment on the part of management 
if the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that 
table of contents such determination is reached 
likewise  if the company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets will decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is reached 
significant estimates are required in determining our income tax benefits 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws and regulations  our future levels of spending for research and development  and changes in our overall level of pre tax earnings or losses 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset in the first quarter of due to the sale of our remaining million shares of abgenix  inc common stock in january and february  in addition to recording a tax provision related to the realized gain on the sale of such shares 
stock based compensation our employee stock compensation plans are accounted for utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under this method  no compensation expense is recognized as long as the exercise price equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
the preparation of our financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the stock price volatility 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we are currently evaluating our option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of evolving accounting standards related to employee stock options 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a revision of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their values 
we expect to calculate the value of share based payments under sfas r on a basis substantially consistent with the fair value approach of sfas we will adopt sfas r in our fiscal quarter beginning january   using the modified prospective method 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations in that fiscal quarter and in each subsequent quarter  although it will have no impact on our overall liquidity 
we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adoption because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future as well as certain assumptions that can materially affect the calculation of the value share based payments to employees and directors 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per common share in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents results of operations revenue revenues were million in compared to million in and million in  as shown in the following table in thousands novartis ag japan tobacco inc sanofi aventis group transkaryotic therapies  inc ceregene  inc since august  other revenues for included million from novartis recognized in connection with our global alliance for the development and commercialization of oncolytic virus therapies 
previously under this alliance we recognized million of revenue in and million in as of december  we have recognized all revenues associated with the million payment received from novartis in july revenues for also included million in connection with our gene activation technology license agreement with sanofi aventis group for gene activated erythropoietin  compared to revenues of million in and million in under the same agreement 
we recorded contract revenue of million in for services provided to ceregene after august   the date as of which our ownership of ceregene became a minority ownership position 
we also recognized as other revenue in approximately million in grants received by ceregene on their alzheimer s disease and als research projects during the period it was a consolidated subsidiary 
in august  we announced that an agreement had been reached regarding outstanding clinical and patent related milestone and wind down payments from japan tobacco inc jt  in connection with the termination in of a collaboration agreement for certain gvax cancer immunotherapies  for which we now hold all worldwide commercial rights 
we recorded million in revenue associated with this final agreement in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these increases can be attributed to our expanding clinical trials and other product development activities in both our gvax cancer immunotherapy and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
in july  we announced the commencement of our vital trial  which compares gvax prostate cancer immunotherapy to taxotere chemotherapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer without cancer related pain 
in june  we announced the commencement of our vital trial  which compares gvax prostate cancer immunotherapy plus taxotere chemotherapy to taxotere chemotherapy alone in advanced prostate cancer patients with cancer related pain 
we expect that our research and development expenditures and headcount will increase in future years to support expanded  more advanced and more numerous clinical trials  and associated manufacturing and product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors  including progress in research and development and clinical trials 
biopharmaceutical products  such as those being developed by us  may take to years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind application  which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and costs for each phase are generally larger than the preceding phase  as the size of the clinical trial number of patients grows 
the most significant costs associated with 
table of contents clinical development are the phase trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have one product in development for which we have initiated phase studies 
however  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
estimates of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
completion of clinical trials  including the vital and vital trials that we initiated in july and june  respectively  may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
however  we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are usually completed over the following timelines estimated clinical phase completion period phase years phase years phase years many factors may delay our commencement and speed of completion of clinical trials  including the size and number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up required  the number of clinical sites at which the trial is conducted  competing trials and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda or a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
there can be no assurance that any approval required by the fda or other regulatory body will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see item a risk factors above 
included below is a summary of products and the related stage of development for each product in clinical development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of ongoing phase constitutes forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
our estimates of timing of completion of these trials are based on typical times of completion for trials of that type at such phases of development 
the actual timing of completion of these phases of our clinical trials could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table due to the number of patients enrolled in the trial  the number of clinical trial sites involved  the time needed to fully enroll the trial  the time required for patient follow up and other factors 
longer time frames for the completion of certain trials may be the result of requirements to measure patient survival 
in addition  it is possible that any of these ongoing clinical trials may never be completed due to the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related side effects  lack of clinical efficacy  insufficient supply of product for these clinical trials and other factors

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in in connection with the move of our corporate headquarters to south san francisco  california in march  we recorded lease exit costs related to our foster city facility of million in and million in and reversed million of previously recorded expenses in excluding the effects of these charges  general and administrative expenses increased million from to and decreased million from to the increase in compared to is attributed to higher legal and accounting costs associated with general corporate activities 
the higher expenses in compared to reflected approximately million of facility costs  million for ceregene  our previously majority owned subsidiary  and approximately million of non recurring facility start up and close down costs in connection with the move from the former headquarters in foster city  california partially offset by increased costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and other corporate governance requirements 
future spending for general and administrative costs is expected to increase in order to support our growing infrastructure needs 
restructuring charges in june  we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring of our business operations to focus resources on our most advanced and most promising product development programs 
in november  we sold our san diego manufacturing facility for viral products to genzyme corporation for million 
we recorded a charge of million in related to its restructuring decisions  including million for workforce reduction initiatives  million to reduce the carrying value of the san diego manufacturing facility and million for lease termination and other expenses

we recorded interest expense related to our convertible senior notes  including amortization of related debt issuance costs  of million and million in and  respectively 
we recorded interest expense on our previously outstanding bank debt of million and million in and  respectively  and capitalized interest expense of million in in connection with the construction of our manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
interest expense associated with our south san francisco  california capital lease obligation was million in  million in and million in 
table of contents income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million and million in and  respectively  and recorded a tax benefit of million in the tax provision recorded in relates to the realized gain on the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock partially offset by tax benefits related to unrealized gains on abgenix common stock and million of additional interest for tax contingencies 
the tax provision recorded in relates to the realized gain on the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock 
the tax benefits recorded in primarily related to net operating losses that the company concluded are realizable based on an estimate of future taxable income  including future taxable income that may result from sales of our abgenix common stock 
net operating losses that we have concluded are realizable are based on our estimate of future taxable income  including taxable income from sales of abgenix  inc common stock 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets is based on our ability to carry forward these net operating losses to offset that potential future taxable income 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal net operating losses will expire in the years beginning through  if not utilized 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  including million classified as restricted cash  related to outstanding letters of credit for our corporate headquarters facility in south san francisco  california and cgmp manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
information regarding the classification of these assets is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
we have maintained our financial position through strategic management of our resources including our holdings in abgenix common stock  funding from various corporate collaborations and licensing agreements and the availability of debt financing 
in february  our shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  which allowed us to offer up to million of securities on short notice in one or more public offerings 
we used this shelf registration in march to complete a public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
although up to million may still be offered under the shelf registration  there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any of the remaining securities under this shelf registration on acceptable terms  or at all 
at december   we held approximately million shares of abgenix common stock  which had a fair market value of approximately million as of that date 
in january and february  we sold all million shares of abgenix common stock held at december   resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in october and november  we sold a total of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due in a private placement 
we received approximately million in proceeds after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses  which we used to repay bank debt totaling million  thereby eliminating restrictions on million of cash 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due primarily to a decline in revenues of million and the addition of a restructuring charge of million 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to a million increase in the net loss 
in  we recorded the receipt of an aggregate of million in tax refunds from the internal revenue service and california franchise tax board from the income tax paid in and for the gain on sale of abgenix common stock 
also  we received million in from a license agreement with transkaryotic therapies  inc cash requirements for operating activities are expected to increase in future periods  due in part to significant costs related to our ongoing phase trials 
the timing of these cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials  obligations 
table of contents related to our existing manufacturing and headquarter facilities  and future requirements to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities for any products that we may develop 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in and million in compared to million net cash used by investing activities in cash provided by net short term investments activities was million higher in compared to and million higher in compared to cash inflows for the period include million in net proceeds from the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock compared to proceeds of million in related to the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock and million in from the sale of million shares of abgenix common stock 
cash inflows for also include million in connection with the sale of our san diego manufacturing facility for viral products to genzyme corporation 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in and million in in  we completed construction of additional research areas in our corporate headquarters in south san francisco  california 
capital expenditures for consisted primarily of expenses incurred in connection with the construction of our cgmp manufacturing facility in hayward  california and our former cgmp manufacturing facilities in san diego  california and in memphis  tennessee  which were completed in late our cgmp manufacturing facility located in hayward  california is currently manufacturing gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer product for our ongoing phase clinical trials 
leasehold improvements for our corporate headquarters in south san francisco  california were completed in march net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in cash flows in include net proceeds of million from the private placement of our convertible senior notes issuance in october and november and net proceeds of million in connection with our public offering of  shares of common stock in march in october  we used part of the proceeds from our note issuance to repay loans of an aggregate of million to fleet bank and silicon valley bank 
in july  we received a million upfront payment from novartis ag  of which million was attributed to the issuance of an aggregate of million shares of our common stock to novartis and gti  and the remaining million was attributed to deferred revenue 
as of december  we have recognized all revenues associated with the million payment received from novartis in july in september  we borrowed million from silicon valley bank under a five year term loan agreement 
we did not enter into any significant financing activities in in connection with a gain on sale of abgenix common stock in  we paid million in federal and state income taxes 
since we have received million in tax refunds from the carryback of losses 
we have additional unutilized federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards  although the future utilization of our federal nol carryforwards is limited by internal revenue code section  which imposes an annual limitation on taxable income that can be offset by nol s following a change in control 
for irs purposes we experienced a change in control during our acquisition of somatix in our unutilized state net operating loss carryforwards may be similarly limited 
we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
these leases  including the hayward and memphis facility leases  expire at various dates through  and some contain options for renewal 
our south san francisco headquarters facility lease is recorded as a capital lease as a result of certain amendments that required us to fund the costs of certain structural components of the facility 
in connection with the sale of our san diego  california manufacturing facility for viral products to genzyme corporation and the termination of the related facility leases in november  we retired approximately million of leasehold improvements and manufacturing assets and million of related accumulated depreciation 
also in november we terminated the lease for our former corporate headquarters facility in foster city  california and retired approximately million of associated leasehold improvements  equipment and related accumulated depreciation 
the increase in leasehold improvements and the decrease in construction in process in compared to reflect the completion of our corporate headquarters facility in south san francisco  california and the completion of our cgmp manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
the hayward facility was placed in service during in  we moved 
table of contents our corporate headquarters to south san francisco from foster city  california 
as a result  we retired approximately million and million of leasehold improvements and other assets related to our former corporate headquarters in foster city  california  and approximately million and million of related accumulated depreciation  in and in  respectively 
the decrease in construction in process also reflects the deconsolidation of ceregene in august subsequent to ceregene s series b preferred stock financing 
our long term contractual obligations at december  were as follows in thousands payment due and total and and thereafter convertible senior notes south san francisco capital lease obligation operating leases under certain circumstances  we may redeem some or all of the convertible senior notes on or after november  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts  if any to  but not including  the repurchase date 
the notes are convertible into our common stock  initially at the conversion price of per share  equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment 
we estimate that our cash to be used in operating activities during will be approximately million to million 
this estimated use of cash does not include capital expenditures or the cost of any potential acquisitions  nor does it reflect the potential offset by equity or debt financings or major new collaborative ventures 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development  clinical  manufacturing and commercialization activities  our ability to establish new collaborations and the terms of those collaborations  our ability to reach a favorable resolution with the irs with respect to their audit of our fiscal federal tax return  or to other potential tax assessments  competing technological and market developments  the time and cost of regulatory approvals  and various other factors that we discuss under item a  risk factors above 
our ongoing development programs and any increase in the number and size of programs and trials will reduce our current cash resources and potentially create further need to raise additional capital 
therefore  we will continue to consider financing alternatives  including collaborative ventures and potential equity and debt financings 
while we believe that our current liquidity position will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next year  we may need to raise substantial additional funds in order to complete our pending and planned trials over their multi year course before we will obtain product revenue  if any  from such products 
accordingly  we may entertain the possibility of raising additional capital to preserve our liquidity  depending on a number of conditions  including conditions in the capital markets 
the sources of liquidity available to us include payments from potential partners and or licensees of our potential products and technologies  and private or public placement of cell genesys equity securities  warrants  debt securities or depositary shares 
we regularly consider the conditions of capital markets  dilution  stockholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing on stockholders 
certain of the financing options available to us may have negative consequences to stockholders such as dilution 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a negative consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to stockholders
