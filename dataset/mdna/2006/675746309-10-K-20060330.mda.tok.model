item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation dollars in thousands  except share data the following discussion of our results of operations  consolidated financial condition and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial information  consolidated financial statements and the related notes  all included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of risks in the marketplace or other future events 
our critical accounting policies are those that relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of our consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies  as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our residential servicing business 
inherent in our growth of this business has been the acquisition of mortgage servicing rights  an intangible asset representing the present value of the right to service loans in a portfolio 
as of december   we held  of mortgage servicing rights with a fair value of  the most critical accounting policy for this business is the methodology we use to determine the value of mortgage servicing rights 
application of this methodology requires the development of a number of estimates  including anticipated amortization and periodic revaluation 
we estimate the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights based on the results of our internal valuation and an external valuation obtained from an independent third party valuation specialist 
our internal valuation calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows utilizing market based assumptions 
the more significant assumptions used in our internal valuation include o prepayment speeds o compensating interest expense o delinquency experience o discount rate o interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances o interest rate used for computing float earnings o cost of servicing prepayment speeds and delinquency experience are derived from our historical experience by strata 
our strata are based upon loan type  which represents the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans  including o subprime o alt a o high loan to value o re performing o special servicing o non residential mortgage o other for the subprime and alt a loan types  the loans are further stratified by product type between adjustable and fixed rate 
the table presented below provides overall prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage by strata projected over a five year period as of december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high ltv re performing special servicing non residential mortgage other the discount rate  interest rate for the cost of financing advances  interest rate for float earnings and the cost of servicing are based on the market assumptions provided by our third party valuation specialist 
as of december   these assumptions were as follows o discount rate of o interest rate of one month libor plus basis points for the cost of financing advances o interest rate equal to the federal funds rate for float earnings o assumptions regarding the cost of servicing vary by strata  and range from a low of per year for a performing alt a loan to a high of per year for a loan that is in foreclosure 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to impact our results of operations as summarized below o increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights as the underlying loans prepay faster  causing higher mortgage servicing rights amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by lower overall cost of servicing and increased float balances and income 
o increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period and the amount of servicing advances and related interest expense increases 
o increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights due to the lower overall net present value of the combined cash flows 
o increases in interest rate assumptions for the cost of servicing advances will increase interest expense while rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize as fee income 
o increases in interest rate assumptions also generally increase the value of our mortgage servicing rights as the projected prepayment rate for the underlying loans slows  while decreases in interest rate assumptions generally reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights as the projected prepayment rate for the underlying loans increases 
we perform an interest rate sensitivity analysis of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio every quarter 
we currently estimate that the fair value of the portfolio increases by for every basis point bps increase in interest rates and reduces by for every bps decline in interest rates 
an impairment analysis is performed after grouping our loans into the seven strata based on loan type which represents the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio  the type of asset mortgage or non mortgage and the default risk 
we amortize mortgage servicing rights over the period of estimated net servicing income based on our projections of the amount and timing of future cash flows 
the amount and timing of servicing asset amortization is adjusted periodically based on actual results and updated projections 
during and  and most of  mortgage prepayment speeds in our servicing portfolio remained high  resulting in a substantial rate of amortization of the balance of servicing rights 
valuation of deferred tax assets another accounting policy that requires the use of estimates and the application of judgment is the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december  we had gross deferred tax assets of  and a corresponding valuation allowance of  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  our valuation allowance was primarily established in  when we recorded an  provision to increase the valuation allowance on our prior years deferred tax assets 
during and  we provided an additional valuation allowance equal to the amount of any deferred tax assets recorded during the year 
during  we recorded a  partial reversal of the valuation allowance we had established on the deferred tax asset in prior years 
this reduction in the allowance in was the result of refund claims we filed with the irs that reduced our deferred tax asset and increased our income tax receivable balance by the same amount 
the evaluation of the need to maintain our valuation allowance takes into consideration our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of future taxable income 
the tax character ordinary versus capital and the carry forward and carry back periods of certain tax attributes eg  capital losses and tax credits are also considered 
significant judgment is required in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to realizability of the deferred tax assets 
the determination of the amount of the aggregate valuation allowance is based on scenario analyses of the projected results of operations by line of business resulting in a range of potential valuation allowances  within which a final amount is determined 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter and a change in the valuation allowance may be warranted in the future 
overview changes in financial condition total assets rose to  during  as compared to  as of december  this increase is primarily due to a  increase in our loans held for resale  which is largely comprised of residential loans that we purchased during the fourth quarter  and a  increase in match funded residential servicing advances 
offsetting these increases was a  decline in cash and investment grade securities which largely resulted from the cash payment we made to marathon upon its assumption of the customer deposit liabilities in connection with debanking 
also  during we collected the  of federal income tax refund claims and related interest that existed at december  total liabilities increased to  at december  as compared to  at december  this increase is largely the result of a repurchase agreement with a balance of  entered into to finance the purchase of loans held for resale and a  increase in match funded liabilities as we utilized increased borrowing capacity 
offsetting these increases was the removal of customer deposits and escrow deposits from our balance sheet at the completion of debanking 
these deposits totaled  at december  also  during  we repurchased  of our debt securities 
at december   we had  of cash   of unused borrowing capacity on our existing lines  including  that is available to a consolidated vie  and  of equity 
results of operations we recorded net income of  for as compared to net income of  and  for and  respectively 
our basic earnings per share were for  as compared to and for and  respectively 
net income for includes an income tax benefit of  that largely resulted from a  partial reversal of the valuation allowance that we had established on our deferred tax asset in prior years 
pre tax income was   and  for  and  respectively 
our results reflect a strong performance in our residential servicing segment whose pre tax income rose by  or in as compared to this increase primarily reflects the positive impact of rising short term interest rates on our revenue from custodial accounts float earnings and a reduction in total operating expenses  offset in part by continued high mortgage prepayment speeds for most of and a reduction in the properties being marketed under our contract with the united states department of veterans affairs va 
residential servicing is our most profitable segment with pre tax income of   and  for  and  respectively 
after incurring pre tax losses in and due to significant start up costs related to our international operations  commercial servicing earned a profit of  in on higher fees earned from both domestic and international operations 
offsetting these improvements were declines in both our residential origination services and ocwen recovery group segments 
pre tax income for residential origination services declined by  or in  primarily reflecting losses from our new mortgage due diligence and loan processing business  reduced earnings from our uk residual security portfolio  a charge to recognize the full impairment of a working capital investment in a consolidated variable interest entity vie and a charge to reduce the carrying value of our loans held for resale to market value 
after being profitable in and  ocwen recovery group incurred a pre tax loss of in primarily reflecting a shift in revenue from maturing proprietary assets to lower yielding third party contracts 
results of our corporate items and other segment have continued to improve with pretax income of in as compared to losses of  and  in and this improvement is largely due to reduced interest expense  the recognition of interest income on federal income tax refund claims in and  gains from the repurchase of debt securities in and reduced losses from the commercial assets business

additionally  mortgage servicing rights increased by  as a result of an increase in acquisitions  and advances declined by  the  or increase in total liabilities of this segment during is primarily due to a  increase in match funded liabilities 
also  escrow deposits declined by  as a result of debanking  and net borrowings under secured credit lines increased by  the increase in match funded assets and liabilities primarily reflects a  increase in borrowing capacity during december  selected balance sheet data total assets   match funded advances   advances   mortgage servicing rights   receivables   total liabilities   match funded liabilities   servicer liabilities   lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
  escrow deposits  match funded advances 
match funded advances consist of the following december  principal and interest   taxes and insurance   other   match funded advances on loans serviced for others resulted from our transfer of residential loan servicing related advances to a third party in exchange for cash 
the original and subsequent transfers did not qualify as sales for accounting purposes since we retained effective control of the advances 
accordingly  we report the amount of proceeds received from the sale as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral match funded liabilities 
the increase in match funded advances is primarily the result of a  increase during in the amount of debt available at favorable rates under the match funded securitization facility that we first executed in november advances 
advances consist of the following december  principal and interest   taxes and insurance   other   during any period in which the borrower is not making payments  we are required under certain servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors  pay property taxes and insurance premiums and process foreclosures 
we generally recover these advances from borrowers for reinstated and performing loans and from investors for foreclosed loans 
we record a charge to the extent that we estimate that advances are uncollectible  taking into consideration the age and nature of the advance and our historical loss experience  among other factors 
advances on loans serviced for others are net of reserves of and  as of december  and  respectively 
mortgage servicing rights 
the unamortized balance of mortgage servicing rights is primarily related to subprime residential loans 
our investment increased by  during as purchases exceeded amortization 
mortgage servicing rights declined during as amortization exceeded purchases  reflecting the more cautious acquisition strategy that we had adopted given the uncertainty of prepayment speeds 
of the  of purchases in   or closed during the fourth quarter  reflecting an improvement in market conditions 
december  balance at beginning of period   purchases   amortization   balance at end of period   at december   we serviced loans under servicing agreements for investors 
this compares to servicing agreements for investors at december  receivables 
receivables related to the residential servicing business include  and  at december  and december   respectively  representing fees earned from the servicing of loans and real estate 
the remaining balance consists principally of reimbursable expenses due from loan servicing investors 
the total balance of receivables for this segment is net of reserves of  and  at december  and december   respectively 
match funded liabilities 
match funded liabilities represent proceeds received from transfers of loans and advances on loans serviced for others 
because we retained effective control over the assets transferred  these transfers did not qualify as sales for accounting purposes  and we  therefore  report them as secured borrowings with pledges of collateral 
balance outstanding at unused december  borrowing collateral interest rate capacity advances see below    advances month libor basis points    in november  we executed a servicing advance securitization 
this transaction involved the issuance of a term note for  and a one year variable funding note for a maximum of  on march   we executed an indenture supplement to the november securitization with a closing date of april  this supplement included the issuance of a second term note for  in addition  the maximum amount of the variable funding note was increased to  the original term note bears interest at libor plus basis points  and the second term note bears interest at libor plus basis points 
the variable funding note bears interest at a commercial paper rate plus a margin that approximates libor plus basis points 
the original term note under this facility has a stated maturity of october  and the second term note has a stated maturity of march the variable funding note has a stated maturity of november the variable funding note has a stated maturity of november month libor was and at december  and  respectively 
under the terms of the agreement  we are eligible to finance additional advances on loans serviced for others up to a maximum balance of  this facility will mature in january servicer liabilities 
servicer liabilities represent amounts we have collected  primarily from residential servicing borrowers  that will be deposited in custodial accounts and excluded from our balance sheet  paid directly to an investment trust or refunded to borrowers 
the following table sets forth the principal components of servicer liabilities december  borrower payments due to custodial accounts   escrow payments due to custodial accounts   partial payments and other unapplied balances   lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
secured line of credit arrangements are as follows balance outstanding at unused december  borrowing borrowing type interest rate maturity capacity senior secured credit month libor agreement or basis points june    senior secured credit month libor agreement basis points december  month libor was and at december  and  respectively 
secured by mortgage servicing rights and advances on loans serviced for others 
borrowing secured by mortgage servicing rights is at libor plus basis points 
borrowing secured by other acceptable collateral is at libor plus basis points 
the interest rate may be reduced to or to the extent that we have available balances on deposit with the lender 
we repaid in full the balance outstanding under this credit agreement during the second quarter of and terminated the agreement 
escrow deposits 
escrow deposits amounted to  at december  and consisted of custodial deposit balances representing funds collected from borrowers for the payment of taxes and insurance premiums on mortgage properties underlying loans that we serviced for others 
in connection with debanking  these custodial deposits were transferred from the bank to an unaffiliated bank and are now excluded from our balance sheet 
pre tax income for the residential servicing segment increased by  or  in as compared to increases in short term interest rates during have had a positive impact on our float earnings on funds that we have received from borrowers that are held in custodial accounts until remitted to investors 
however  mortgage prepayment speeds in our servicing portfolio remained high through most of not only do prepayments result in the loss of future servicing fees  they also result in increases to the rate at which we amortize the balance of our servicing rights 
prepayments also create an obligation for us to pay compensating interest expense to investors for the full month of interest on loans that are repaid before the end of a calendar month 
results for also reflect a decline in operating expenses  primarily compensation and benefits and compensating interest  and a decline in earnings from our va contract due to decreased transaction volumes

custodial accounts are excluded from our balance sheet 
the average balances held in these custodial accounts were approximately   and  for  and respectively 
the underlying servicing agreements restrict the investment of float balances to certain types of instruments

compensation and benefits expense 
the decrease in compensation expense and benefits in as compared to has occurred primarily due to a decline in the average number of employees in the us as a result of cost reduction initiatives put in place earlier in the year  including a greater utilization of the lower cost workforce in india 
although average employment in india increased in  total average employment declined and the ratio of india employment to total employment increased significantly as compared to the increase in compensation and benefits in as compared to reflects an increase in average employment  both in the us and india 
average employment in the residential servicing segment for the last three years is as follows india united states the increase in average employment in as compared to was primarily due to the following o the property management contract we entered into with the va in september resulted in the need to hire additional staff 
o in september  we terminated our agreement with an external law firm to manage certain aspects of our loan resolution function  which included  among other functions  the issuance of obligatory breach notices to delinquent borrowers  for which the law firm charged us a fee 
at that time  we decided to cease to assess these fees to borrowers although it was legally permissible for us to do so under the mortgage documents 
upon termination of the agreement  we began performing these functions internally 
this resulted in the need to hire additional staff to perform these functions which increased compensation and benefit expenses as well as the related occupancy and technology costs 
professional services expense 
professional services in includes  to provide for current and pending litigation  including  for a judgment in a wrongful foreclosure case 
while this amount is substantially less than the initial jury verdict  we believe the award is not justified and will continue to defend the case 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this matter 
servicing and origination expenses 
the principal components of servicing and origination expenses are compensating interest    satisfaction expense    other    during and  prepayments on our loans serviced for others increased significantly primarily due to declining mortgage interest rates 
accordingly  we were required to pay increased compensating interest to the securitization trusts for the full month of interest on loans that were repaid before the end of a calendar month 
other operating expenses 
other primarily consists of overhead allocation charges and bad debt expense 
the increase in other operating expenses in is in large part due to an increase in bad debt expense as a result of providing for aged reimbursable expenses that may be uncollectible 
bad debt expense amounted to   and in  and  respectively 
commercial servicing the decline in assets and liabilities of this segment during is primarily due to the sale of two subsidiaries in december that were engaged in servicing operations in japan 
december  selected balance sheet data total assets   match funded loans  receivables   total liabilities   match funded liabilities  commercial match funded loans were held by one of the gss subsidiaries in japan that was sold in these match funded loans resulted from the transfer  on a non recourse basis  of an undivided participation interest in certain real estate loans to a japanese subsidiary of merrill lynch on march  in exchange for cash 
the transfer did not qualify as a sale for accounting purposes as we did not meet all of the conditions for surrender of control over the transferred loans 
accordingly  we reported the amount of proceeds we received from the transfer as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral match funded liabilities 
the commercial servicing segment became profitable in on increased revenues  primarily reflecting higher asset resolution fees earned in both our domestic servicing operations and our asia operations of gss as well as lower operating expenses

recoveries of unsecured credit card receivables that we own have declined as these portfolios have declined in size and have not been replaced 
we have not purchased any unsecured credit card receivables since the increase in operating expenses in and is largely due to the following o higher compensation and benefits in and the first half of due to an increase in staffing levels  o an increase in legal fees and settlements in related to the settlement of contract disputes  and o an increased share of corporate overhead costs in residential origination services total assets of this segment increased by  during primarily due to a  increase in loans held for resale 
this increase is largely the result of loans acquired during the fourth quarter 
these loans were acquired with the intention of securitizing them and retaining the residual securities 
the securitization was completed in february in addition to providing various mortgage due diligence and loan origination services  our strategy in this business includes the targeted acquisition of residual securities  either directly or indirectly through the purchase and subsequent securitization of loans 
the  increase in liabilities in is primarily due to a repurchase agreement to finance the purchase of the loans 
december  selected balance sheet data total assets   trading securities   loans held for resale   receivables   total liabilities   lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
 trading securities 
consists of subordinate and residual securities 
during  the balance declined by  primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the unrated uk subprime residual securities  principal repayments and amortization 
this decline was offset in part by a residual security with a fair value of at december  that was retained in connection with a securitization of loans held for resale during the fourth quarter 
subordinate and residual securities do not have a contractual maturity but are paid down over time as cash distributions are received 
the weighted average remaining life of these securities was years at december  the anticipated effective yield to maturity as of december  based on the purchase price  actual cash flows received to date and the current estimate of future cash flows under the assumptions was 
the original anticipated effective yield to maturity based on the purchase price and anticipated future cash flows under pricing assumptions was 
differences in the december  anticipated yield to maturity from that originally anticipated are due to differences between estimated cash flows and actual cash flows 
each quarter  we update the assumptions used to estimate future cash flows based on the actual results to date 
the primary assumptions include prepayment speeds  loss rates and the discount rate 
the mortgages that underlie our residential trading unrated subprime subordinate and residual securities amounted to  at december  and are secured by properties located in states and the uk 
the largest aggregate value of mortgages in any one state or foreign country is  in the uk 
loans held for resale 
loans held for resale represent single family residential loans originated or acquired by our residential origination services segment that we intend to sell or securitize 
these loans are carried at the lower of cost or market value and were comprised of the following at december o loans with a carrying value of  net of market valuation reserve of  were acquired during the fourth quarter of these loans were securitized in a transaction that closed in february o loans with a carrying value of  unpaid principal balance of  net of a market valuation reserve of  were acquired as a part of an acquisition of  of loans in september in connection with the termination of securitization trusts in which we were the servicer and holder of residual securities 
these loans included non performing loans at the time of acquisition 
in october  we completed a securitization involving  of these loans 
the remaining carrying value at december  includes  of non performing loans 
o loans with a carrying value of  were originated in connection with our new origination services business 
o a balance of  represented loans that were originated in response to requests from residential servicing customers to refinance their mortgage 
a balance of  of such loans was outstanding at december   all of which were sold in january only loans with sales commitments prior to closing are originated under this program 
of the loans outstanding at december   nearly all were sold in january o loans with a carrying value of  were held by a consolidated vie 
the majority of these loans were sold in february receivables 
the  increase in receivables during is primarily due to uncollected principal and interest on loans held for resale 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
the loans we acquired in the fourth quarter of were funded through a transaction involving the sale of loans under an agreement to repurchase which we account for as a collateralized financing

borrowing above this level is at libor plus basis points 
results for include an operating loss from the mortgage fulfillment center and due diligence operation we acquired in december this loss primarily reflects our need to increase processing staff in advance of increased transaction volume 
our results were also impacted by declining earnings on our maturing portfolio of uk based residual securities  a provision to fully reserve a working capital investment in a consolidated vie and charges recorded to provide market valuation reserves on loans held for resale

a decline in cash flows from the uk securities has resulted in reduced interest income and a decline in fair value 
the  of net unrealized losses for were almost entirely offset by realized gains of  the realized gains resulted from the following o on june   we purchased  of unrated residual securities related to loans for which we were the master servicer for the related securitizations 
as the master servicer  we had the clean up call rights to collapse the related trusts once the balance of the underlying loans outstanding reached the optional termination amount of of the original amount of loans in the securitization 
in september  we exercised our call rights and purchased the approximately  of remaining loans from the trusts 
as a result  the over collateralization was remitted to us  and we realized a gain of  on the residual securities that we had purchased 
we purchased the loans with the intention of securitizing or selling them 
a portion of the loans that we acquired were nonperforming  and we recorded a provision of  to reduce these nonperforming loans to their market value  yielding a net gain of  o in october  we completed the securitization of  of the loans acquired in the transaction described above and recorded a gain of  we retained a residual security with a fair value of business process outsourcing this segment began operations in results reflect the initiation of new outsourcing contracts in late and and the expansion of sales and marketing activities in selected operations data pre tax income    process management fees    operating expenses    corporate items and other the decline in assets during primarily reflects a decline in cash and investment grade securities used to fund the transfer of our customer deposits to marathon in connection with debanking

income tax expense benefit the following table provides details of our income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit on income loss before taxes    provision for reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax asset    provision for recapture of base year bad debt reserves  total income tax expense benefit   we maintain a valuation allowance in an amount sufficient to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
the amount of the valuation allowance was based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of future taxable income 
the tax character ordinary versus capital and the carry forward and carry back periods of certain tax attributes eg  capital losses and tax credits were also considered 
we assess the amount of our valuation allowance each quarter and in light of our recent positive earnings history  changes to the valuation allowance may be appropriate in the  reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset in is principally a result of refund claims of  filed with the irs that reduced our gross deferred tax asset and increased our income tax receivable balance by the same amount 
these refund claims  which were affirmed in writing by the irs agent during  arose because of changes in the tax law that allowed us to carry back net operating losses from and to taxes paid in earlier years 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a one time provision of   net of a related reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset to recognize a deferred tax liability arising from the recapture of bad debt reserves in connection with our termination of the bank s status as a federal savings bank 
income tax expense benefit on income loss before income taxes differs from amounts that would be computed by applying the federal corporate income tax rate of primarily because of the effect of foreign taxes  non economic tax residual payments  changes in the valuation allowance and low income housing tax credits 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of taxes at the statutory rate to actual income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense reflects tax credits of   and  respectively 
although we have substantial unused tax credits available to reduce the liability arising from income taxes on our current year income  tax credits can be used to reduce income tax expense only to the corporate alternative minimum tax rate of of taxable income 
liquidity  commitments and off balance sheet risks liquidity our primary sources of funds for liquidity are o lines of credit and other secured borrowings o match funded liabilities o debt securities o servicing fees o payments received on trading securities we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements 
at december   we had  of unrestricted cash  which represented of total assets 
under certain of our credit facilities  we are required to maintain minimum liquidity levels 
among the risks and challenges associated with our funding activities are the following o as a result of debanking  we are no longer able to raise funds through customer deposits in the us o cash requirements to fund our acquisition of additional servicing rights and related advances and to fund existing operations and growth in other core business lines 
o the maturity of an existing line of credit with an outstanding balance of  in june  subject to the renewal of this agreement 
we grow our residential servicing business through the purchase of servicing rights or by entering into subservicing agreements 
servicing rights entitle us as the owner to earn servicing fees and other types of ancillary income  but they also impose on us various obligations as the servicer 
among these are the obligations to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest payments for certain investors and to pay taxes  insurance and various other items that are required to preserve the assets being serviced 
our ability to expand our residential servicing business depends in part on our ability to obtain additional financing to purchase new servicing rights and to fund servicing advances 
we currently use a variety of sources of debt to finance these assets  including match funded agreements  credit facilities and seller financing 
our credit facilities provide financing to us at amounts that are less than the full value of the related servicing assets that serve as collateral for the credit facilities 
if we cannot replace or renew these sources as they mature or obtain additional sources of financing  we may be unable to acquire new servicing rights or make the associated advances 
credit facilities directly related to our residential servicing business are summarized as follows o under a match funding agreement that we entered into on december   we are eligible to sell advances on loans serviced for others up to a maximum debt balance of  at any one time 
at december   we had  of match funded liabilities outstanding under this facility which will mature in january o we have a  secured credit agreement that may be used to fund servicing advances and acquisitions of servicing rights 
at december   we had a balance outstanding under this agreement of  the agreement matures in june o under a match funding agreement we entered into on november   we are eligible to sell advances on loans serviced for others up to a maximum outstanding balance of  as of december   the balance outstanding under this agreement was  the two term notes of  and  under this facility have stated maturities of october and march  respectively 
the variable funding note has a maximum amount of  and a stated maturity of november in addition  our residential origination services has available a warehouse line of credit of  we had no borrowings outstanding under this line  which expires in october we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including internally generated funds  will be adequate to fund planned activities  although there can be no assurances in this regard 
at december   we had  of unused borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements  including  that is available to a consolidated vie 
we continue to evaluate other sources of liquidity  such as debt securities  lines of credit from unaffiliated parties  match funded debt and other secured borrowings 
our operating activities provided used   and  of cash flows during  and  respectively 
the decline in operating cash flow in primarily reflects the net increase in loans we held for resale and a decline in the amount of borrower payments held by us prior to their transfer to collection accounts  offset in part by the collection of federal income tax refund claims and related interest totaling  and an increase in cash provided by trading activities due primarily to the sale and maturity of investment grade securities held at december  our investing activities provided used cash flows totaling   and  during  and  respectively 
the decline in cash flows provided by investing activities in is largely the result of an increase in purchases of mortgage servicing rights  coupled with a decline in proceeds from the sale of real estate and a decline in principal payments received on loans and partly offset by a decline in loan originations in our financing activities provided cash flows of   and during  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased in principally because of  of cash we received under a collateralized borrowing agreement we entered into to finance a purchase of loans held for resale  offset by a decline in deposits and the repurchase of debt securities in the decline in deposits in resulted from maturing certificates of deposit and the cash payment to marathon in connection with its assumption of our customer deposits 
also  in we received proceeds from our issuance of  of convertible notes  repurchased  shares of our common stock and repaid a maturing line of credit collateralized by servicing advances

we believe that we have adequate resources to fund all unfunded commitments to the extent required and to meet all contractual obligations as they come due 
off balance sheet risks as of december  we had outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans of  and outstanding commitments to sell  of these loans 
in addition to commitments to extend credit  we are party to various off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of our business to manage our interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have also committed to fund operating cash deficits of certain affordable housing properties that we have sold and are a limited guarantor under a master loan and security agreement that terminates in october our guarantee is limited to of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans pledged to secure any debt under this agreement 
the maximum amount of potential future payments under the guaranty is approximately  including  related to a consolidated vie 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
we conduct business with a variety of financial institutions and other companies in the normal course of business  including counterparties to our off balance sheet financial instruments 
we are subject to potential financial loss if the counterparty is unable to complete an agreed upon transaction 
we seek to limit counterparty risk through financial analysis  dollar limits and other monitoring procedures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands market risk includes interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and liquidity risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds  or different bases  than our interest earning assets 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non us dollar functional currency operations and to the extent our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged 
market risk also reflects the risk of declines in the valuation of trading securities  mortgage servicing rights and in the value of the collateral underlying loans 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the highly variable daily cash requirements to support the residential servicing business including acquisitions of mortgage servicing rights  the requirement to make advances pursuant to servicing contracts and the process of remitting borrower payments to the custodial accounts 
in general  we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources including long term debt and financing facilities 
see liquidity  commitments and off balance sheet risks for additional discussion regarding liquidity 
the primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is that they will lose a portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates or because of higher than anticipated delinquency rates occasioned by deteriorating credit conditions 
interest rates  prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans significantly affect both our initial and ongoing valuations and the rate of amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
as of december  and  we held  and  respectively  of mortgage servicing rights 
our residential servicing business is characterized by non interest earning assets financed by interest bearing liabilities 
among the more significant non interest earning assets are servicing advances and mortgage servicing rights 
at december   we had servicing advances of  consisting of advances on loans serviced for others of  and match funded advances on loans serviced for others of  we are also exposed to interest rate risk because earnings on float balances are affected by short term interest rates 
these float balances  which are not included in our financial statements  amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
we report these earnings as a component of servicing and subservicing fees 
at december   the combined balance of our match funded liabilities  debt securities  lines of credit and other secured borrowings totaled  of this amount  was variable rate debt  for which debt service costs are sensitive to changes in interest rates  and  was fixed rate debt 
impact of changes in interest rates on the net value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments we perform an interest rate sensitivity analysis of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio every quarter 
we currently estimate that the fair value of the portfolio increases by approximately for every basis point bps increase in interest rates and reduces by approximately for every bps decline in interest rates 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value by strata 
to the extent that fair value was to decline below amortized cost  we would record an impairment charge to earnings and establish a valuation allowance 
a subsequent increase in fair value could result in the recovery of some or all of a previously established valuation allowance 
however  an increase in fair value of a particular stratum above its amortized cost would not be reflected in current earnings 
the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity or repricing characteristics  and the fair values of those instruments at december  expected maturity date at december  total fair thereafter balance value rate sensitive assets interest earning cash    average interest rate trading securities         average interest rate loans held for resale

we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
we base the prepayment experience reflected herein on our historical experience 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary substantially if future prepayments differ from our historical experience 
the majority of loans held for resale at december  were either sold or securitized during the first quarter of the balances are net of market valuation reserves and include non performing loans

these techniques include interest rate exchange contracts or swap agreements  interest rate caps and floors  us treasury interest rate futures contracts  foreign currency futures contracts  foreign currency forwards and european swaptions and put options 
we have entered into foreign currency futures to hedge our net investment in the foreign subsidiary that owns our uk subprime residual securities 
the notional amount of these futures was pound   at december  our principal exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the british pound versus the us dollar 
our operations in india and the foreign operations of gss also expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  this risk is insignificant
