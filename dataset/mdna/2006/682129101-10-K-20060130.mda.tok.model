capital expenditures for fiscal and were primarily for equipment upgrades and additions 
the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately million 
the company plans to fund substantially all of its capital expenditures from cash flow generated from operations 
if necessary  a portion of capital expenditures will be funded through borrowings under its current credit facility 
cash used by financing activities in of million primarily related to payments under the revolving credit facility 
total debt was million as of november   compared to million as of november  cash used by financing activities in of million primarily related to payments under the revolving credit facility 
cash provided from financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily related to the refinancing effort that the company completed in fiscal long term debt as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements  the company has outstanding million of senior secured notes notes due june  the notes are secured by all real property and equipment relating to the company s ten principal domestic manufacturing facilities 
the company has the option to redeem the notes after may  at a premium 
interest on the notes is paid semi annually on june st and december st 
the company used the proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding amounts under its then existing revolving credit facility  to terminate its receivables sale program and to pay related fees and expenses 
in addition  on may   the company entered into a million  senior secured revolving credit facility facility 
the facility includes a million sublimit for the issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit and a million sublimit for swingline loans 
borrowings under the facility are limited to a borrowing base using customary advance rates for eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under the facility are secured by domestic accounts receivable  inventory and intangible assets 
the facility requires the company to meet a single covenant relating to minimum excess availability 

table of contents effective may   the facility was amended to reduce the applicable interest rate spreads  extend the term of the facility to november  and provide the company with flexibility for investment and refinancing opportunities 
this amendment did not have an impact on the borrowing base of the agreement 
under the facility  the company must maintain an average excess availability of million and at november   the company was in compliance with this requirement 
advances under the facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either an alternate base rate or a eurodollar rate  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the alternate base interest rate is a fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the prime rate or the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus basis points 
the applicable margin for the alternate base rate will vary from to depending on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and the margin was at november  the eurodollar rate is a periodic fixed rate equal to libor 
the applicable margin for the eurodollar rate will vary from to depending on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and the margin was at november  the facility s average borrowing rate at november  was 
based on the trailing month financial results  the applicable margin will drop to in the first fiscal quarter of the facility requires a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the facility 
the commitment fee will vary from to based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and was at november  based on the trailing month financial results  the commitment fee will be in the first fiscal quarter of at november   the amount borrowed and the available balance under the facility were million and million  respectively 
the company had million of standby letters of credit outstanding as of november  based upon current and anticipated levels of operations  the company believes that its cash flow from operations  combined with borrowings that will be available under the facility  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements  including scheduled interest and principal payments  capital expenditures and working capital needs  for the next twelve months 
currently  a portion of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore  the company s liquidity and financial condition will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
contractual obligation payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities recorded on balance sheet total significant accounting policies and management judgments the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements as of november   which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
periodically  the company reviews its estimates and judgments including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  warranty obligations  litigation  environmental reserves  pensions and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical 
table of contents experience and on various assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements a revenue recognition sales are recognized when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is upon shipment 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for sales returns and rebate programs 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for quantity rebates 
if the actual costs of sales returns and rebate programs significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
b allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to identify all specific customers that would be considered doubtful based upon the customer s financial condition  payment history  credit rating and other relevant factors  or those that have been turned over for collection and to reserve for the portion of those outstanding balances that collection does not appear to be likely 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 
c allowance for inventory obsolescence the company s policy is to maintain an inventory obsolescence reserve based upon specifically identified  discontinued or obsolete items and a percentage of quantities on hand compared with usage and sales levels over the last year to two years 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all years presented 
a sudden and unexpected change in design trends and or preferences for patterns  colors and or material could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to increase its reserve for obsolescence 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence  which applies primarily to our decorative products segment  was approximately million and million at november  and  respectively 
d allowance for warranty claims on an on going basis  the company updates its building products warranty reserve for specifically identified or new matters and a detailed study of the reserve is updated on a semi annual basis to reserve for estimated future costs associated with any open warranty year 
the reserve is a highly sensitive estimate based on historical warranty costs and failure rates 
a change in these factors could result in a significant change in the reserve balance 
the warranty reserve at november  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
e litigation and environmental reserves the company reserves for the probable judgments associated with any claims and environmental remediation projects 
the company s legal department periodically reviews claims and remediation efforts 
reserves are based upon their analyses and established at the best estimate 
f pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company  notably the use of a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below  generally reduce the volatility of pension expense income from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets 

table of contents the most significant elements in determining the company s pension expense income in accordance with sfas no 
are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the company recorded non cash pension expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company anticipates fiscal non cash expense to increase to approximately million 
the increase in fiscal is largely attributable to lower investment performance by our pension plan assets  caused by the decline in the stock market and general declines in bond yields 
as a result  the company s accumulated benefit obligation abo liability exceeded pension trust assets by million and the company recorded a non cash charge of million to shareholders deficit equity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the abo exceeds the fair value of plan assets and that the entire prepaid pension asset is written down by recording a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss income in shareholders equity deficit 
changes in long term expectations for inflation and the equity markets have led to the lowering of the assumed rate of return for asset performance 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target allocation of the pension portfolio 
this resulted in the selection of a long term rate of return on assets assumption of for plan year the measurement date of august  was used to determine this rate 
a basis point change in the assumed rate of return for assets would increase or decrease the assets by approximately million 
the company determined the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities at the plan s measurement date  which was august  the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company considered rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized investment ratings agency 
changes in discount rates prior to fiscal have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
with the low interest rate environment  the company decreased the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations to a discount rate of from a discount rate of 
the lower discount rate is contributing to the higher anticipated non cash pension expense in fiscal  accounting for million of the estimated million non cash expense mentioned above 
the measurement date of august  was used to determine this rate 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense on an annual basis by approximately million 
based on asset performance  interest rate and discount rate assumptions and current pension funding rules  the company does not anticipate that a cash contribution to the pension fund will be required prior to however  this funding analysis is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions and such changes may accelerate or delay the requirement to make a cash contribution 
additionally  the company may not have the funds necessary to meet any minimum pension funding requirements 
currently  the plan has a credit balance that will cover cash contribution requirements for the next two years 
factors that could alter the cash requirements and timing of any such cash equivalents are investment returns which differ materially from the company s return assumption 
opportunities to reduce future cash requirements by accelerating contributions ahead of the minimum required schedule 
by following certain strategies  smaller contributions in the near term may prevent the need for larger contributions in the future 
some of those strategies might include  but are not limited to  contributions to avoid pension benefit guaranty corporation variable premiums  a charge to other comprehensive income  and maintain 
table of contents funded status to avoid additional funding requirements under section i of the internal revenue code 
these types of contributions would allow the company to manage the overall cash flow to the plan 
g tax valuation allowance the company has provided a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of recovery of such assets 
as of november   the company had approximately million of net deferred tax assets primarily related to domestic loss carryforwards that expire by  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment losses created as a result of the company s annual impairment test in fiscal and  the cumulative effect of an accounting change effective december   a change in the company s pension liabilities  and other temporary differences for which a valuation allowance of million has been provided 
the company provided a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets after having considered its recent history of cumulative losses since its spin off from gencorp 
h stock based employee compensation the company has elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for the company s employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price of the stock option equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant intrinsic value method  no compensation expense is recognized 
effective december   the company adopted the fair value method of recording stock options as required by sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
all future employee stock option grants beginning december   plus the balance of the non vested grants awarded prior to december   will be expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted 
the company expects the impact from adoption of this standard to be approximately per share in fiscal year this estimate assumes that the number and the fair value of options granted are similar to recent historical amounts 
while the company regularly evaluates the use of share based payments  its recent practice has been to issue fewer stock options than has been issued in the past  utilizing other forms of incentives such as restricted stock  which are required to be expensed using the fair value method 
the actual impact per share would be different in the event the number of options granted or the fair value of options increases or decreases from the current estimate 
i long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and definite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
during fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges of million 
environmental matters the company s policy is to conduct its businesses with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment 
the company devotes significant resources and management attention to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s consolidated balance sheet as of november  reflects reserves for environmental remediation efforts of million 
capital expenditures for projects related to environmental matters were million in  million in and million in the company currently forecasts that capital expenditures for environmental projects will be approximately million in fiscal during  non capital expenditures for environmental compliance and protection totaled million  all of which were for recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution abatement in ongoing operations 
similar non capital expenditures were million and million in fiscal years 
table of contents and  respectively 
the company anticipates that non capital environmental expenditures for the next several years will be consistent with historical expenditure levels 
employee matters the company employs approximately  employees at offices  plants and other facilities located principally throughout the united states and the united kingdom 
the company would generally describe its relationship with employees as good 
approximately of the company s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
there are no collective bargaining agreements due to expire in the fiscal year 
approximately employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements due to expire in the fiscal year 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revision was developed in response to concerns expressed by users of financial statements about their need for more information about pension plans

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb  chapter sfas no

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this standard revises sfas no 
 accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related accounting interpretations  and eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method 
the company currently uses the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
to value stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has historically been recognized for stock options as the company grants stock options with exercise prices equal to the company s common stock market price on the date of the grant 
this standard requires the expensing of all share based compensation  including stock options  using the fair value based method 
using the modified prospective transition method  the company will adopt sfas no 
revised as of december  the modified prospective transition method requires compensation cost to be recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption plus the current period expense for non vested awards issued prior to the adoption of this standard 
no expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods 
the company expects the impact from adoption of this standard to be approximately per share in fiscal year  which will be reflected as compensation expense 
this estimate assumes that the number and the fair value of stock options granted are similar to historical activity for all years 
while the company regularly evaluates the use of share based payments  its recent practice has been to issue fewer stock options than have been issued in the past  utilizing other forms of incentives such as restricted stock 
the actual impact per share would be different in the event the number of options granted or the fair value of options increases or decreases from the current estimate

sfas no 
replaces apb no 
accounting changes and sfas no

this statement also carries forward the guidance from apb no 
regarding the correction of an error and changes in accounting estimates 
the company will adopt this standard in fiscal the company does not anticipate any impact on the financial statements of the company from the adoption of this statement
