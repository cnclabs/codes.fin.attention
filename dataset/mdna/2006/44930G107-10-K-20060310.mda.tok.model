item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leader in the development  manufacture and sale of proprietary  disposable medical connection systems for use in iv therapy applications 
our devices are designed to protect patients from catheter related bloodstream infections and healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases through accidental needlesticks 
we are also a leader in the production of custom iv systems and low cost generic iv systems and we incorporate our proprietary products in many of those custom iv systems 
with the acquisition of hospira s salt lake city plant and commencement of production under a twenty year manufacturing  commercialization and distribution agreement with hospira mcda  we are now also a significant manufacturer of critical care medical devices  including catheters  angiography kits and cardiac monitoring systems 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the expected amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
investment securities are all marketable and considered available for sale 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
under our current investment policies  the securities in which we invest have no significant difference between cost and fair value 
if our investment policies were to change  and there were differences between cost and fair value  that difference  net of tax effect  would be reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we record sales and related costs when ownership of the product transfers to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under the terms of all our purchase orders  ownership transfers on shipment 
if there are significant doubts at the time of shipment as to the collectibility of the receivable  we defer recognition of the sale in revenue until the receivable is collected 
most of our customers are medical product manufacturers or distributors  although some are end users 
our only post sale obligations are warranty and certain rebates 
we warrant products against defects and have a policy permitting the return of defective products 
we record warranty returns as an expense and amounts have been insignificant 
with certain exceptions  customers do not retain any right of return and there is no price protection with respect to unsold products 
returns from customers with return rights have not been significant 
we accrue rebates as a reduction in revenue based on contractual commitments and historical experience 
adjustments of estimates of warranty claims  rebates or returns  which have not been  and are not expected to be material  affect current operating results when they are determined 
accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value 
an allowance is provided for estimated collection losses based on specific past due accounts for which we consider collection to be doubtful 
we rely on prior payment trends  financial status and other factors to estimate the cash which ultimately will be received 
such amounts cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date 
we regularly review individual past due balances for collectibility 
loss exposure is principally with international distributors for whom normal payment terms are long in comparison to those of our other customers and  to a lesser extent  domestic distributors 
many of these distributors are relatively small and we are vulnerable to adverse developments in their businesses that can hinder our collection of amounts due 
if actual collection losses exceed expectations  we could be required to accrue additional bad debt expense  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the accrual occurs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we need to carry many components to accommodate our rapid product delivery  and if we misestimate demand or if customer requirements change  we may have components in inventory that we may not be able to use 
most finished products are made only after we receive orders except for certain standard non custom products which we will carry in inventory in expectation of future orders 
for finished products in inventory  we need to estimate what may not be saleable 
we regularly review inventory for slow moving items and write off all items we do not expect to use in manufacturing  or finished products we do not expect to sell 
if actual usage of components or sales of finished goods inventory is less than our estimates  we could be required to write off additional inventory  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the write off occurs 
property and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
the estimates of useful lives are significant judgments in accounting for property and equipment  particularly for molds and automated assembly machines that are custom made for us 
we may retire them on an accelerated basis if we replace them with larger or more technologically advanced tooling 
the remaining useful lives of all property and equipment are reviewed regularly and lives are adjusted or assets written off based on current estimates of future use 
as part of that review  property and equipment is reviewed for other indicators of impairment 
an unexpected shortening of useful lives of property and equipment that significantly increases depreciation provisions  or other circumstances causing us to record an impairment loss on such assets  could have an adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the related charges are recorded 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas r on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
we adopted the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date 
the modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and  based on the requirements of sfas  for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
we expect to substantially curtail grants of stock options in the future and do not expect to record any significant expenses under sfas r for options currently outstanding 
however  the amount of expense recorded under sfas r will depend upon the number of options granted in the future and their valuation 
we have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business overview until the late s  our primary emphasis in product development  sales and marketing was disposable medical connectors for use in iv therapy  and our principal product was the clave 
in the late s  we commenced a transition from a product centered company to an innovative  fast  efficient  low cost manufacturer of custom iv systems  using processes that we believe can be readily applied to a variety of disposable medical devices 
this strategy has enabled us to capture revenue on the entire iv delivery system  and not just a component of the system 
we are also increasing our efforts to acquire new products 
we acquired the punctur guard line of blood collection needles in  invested in a company developing a new medical device in and increased our investment in this company in  acquired hospira s salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility in may and entered into an agreement to produce critical care products for hospira  and are continuing to seek other opportunities 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in finding acquisition opportunities  or in acquiring companies or products or that we will successfully integrate them into our existing business 
custom iv systems and new products will be of increasing importance to us in future years 
we expect continued growth in our clave products in the us  but at a slower percentage growth rate than prior to because of our large market penetration 
we also potentially face substantial increases in competition in our clave business if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights 
growth for all of our products outside the us could be substantial  although to date it has been relatively modest 
therefore  we are directing increasing product development  acquisition  sales and marketing efforts to custom iv systems and other products that lend themselves to customization and new products in the us and international markets  and increasing our emphasis on markets outside the us our largest customer has been hospira 
our relationship with hospira has been and will continue to be of singular importance to our growth 
in  approximately of our revenue was from sales to hospira 
while our sales to hospira declined to approximately of revenue in  this percentage increased in to 
we expect this percentage to increase in the future both as a result of increased sales of clave products and iv sets to hospira and as a result of the new mcda with hospira as described below 
hospira has a significant share of the iv set market in the iv  and provides us access to that market 
we expect that hospira will be important to our growth for clave  custom products  and our other products in the us and also outside the us on may   we acquired hospira s salt lake city manufacturing facility  related capital equipment  certain inventories and assumed liabilities for million in cash and million of acquisition costs 
we entered into a year mcda with hospira  under which we produce for sale  exclusively to hospira  substantially all the products that hospira had manufactured at that facility 
hospira retains commercial responsibility for the products we are producing  including sales  marketing  pricing  distribution  customer contracts  customer service and billing 
the majority of the products under the mcda are invasive monitoring and angiography products  which include medical devices such as catheters  cardiac monitoring systems and angiography kits 
sales of products manufactured under the mcda from may to december were million 
we have also committed to fund certain research and development to improve critical care products and develop new products for sale to hospira  and have also committed to provide certain sales specialist support 
our prices and our gross margins on the products we sell to hospira under the mcda are based on cost savings that we are able to achieve in producing those products over hospira s cost to manufacture those same products at the purchase date 
we record revenue net of any such reductions 
we give no assurance as to the amounts of future sales or profits under the mcda 
a substantial portion of the invasive monitoring and angiography products made in salt lake city are custom products designed to meet the specific needs of the customer 
we believe we can significantly expand the market for custom invasive monitoring and angiography products through cost savings using our proprietary low cost manufacturing techniques 
we believe that achievement of our growth objectives  both within the us  and outside the us  will require increased efforts by us in sales and marketing and product development in these markets 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy 
the custom products market is still small and we could encounter customer resistance to custom products 
further  we could encounter increased competition as other companies see opportunity 
product development or acquisition efforts may not succeed  and even if we do develop or acquire products  there is no assurance that we will achieve profitable sales of such products 
an adverse change in our relationship with hospira  or a deterioration of hospira s position in the market  could have an adverse effect on us 
increased expenditures for sales and marketing and product acquisition and development may not yield desired results when expected  or at all 
while we have taken steps to control those risks  there are certain of those risks which may be outside of our control  and there is no assurance that steps we have taken will succeed 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  total revenues by product as a percentage of total revenues product line clave custom products critical care excluding custom products punctur guard clc other products license  royalty and revenue share total salt lake city products  including critical care  critical care custom products and other products account for of total revenue for the year ended december  custom iv systems  excluding critical care custom products  were of total revenues for the year ended december  most custom iv systems include one or more claves 
total clave sales including custom iv systems with at least one clave were million or of total revenue in  million or of total revenue in and million or of total revenue in we sell our iv administration products to independent distributors and through agreements with hospira and certain other medical product manufacturers 
most independent distributors handle the full line of our iv administration products 
we sell our invasive monitoring  angiography and iv administration products through three agreements with hospira the hospira agreements 
under a agreement  hospira purchases clave products  principally bulk  non sterile connectors  and the clc and since  our punctur guard line of blood collection needles 
under a agreement  we sell custom iv systems to hospira under a program referred to as setsource 
our and agreements with hospira provide hospira with conditional exclusive and nonexclusive rights to distribute all existing icu medical products worldwide with terms that extend to under the mcda  a agreement  we sell hospira invasive monitoring  angiography and other products which they formerly manufactured at the salt lake city facility 
the terms of the mcda extend to we also sell certain other products to a number of other medical product manufacturers 
we believe that as healthcare providers continue to either consolidate or join major buying organizations  the success of our products will depend  in part  on our ability  either independently or through strategic relationships such as our hospira relationship  to secure long term contracts with large healthcare providers and major buying organizations 
as a result of this marketing and distribution strategy we derive most of our revenues from a relatively small number of distributors and manufacturers 
the loss of a strategic relationship with a customer or a decline in demand for a manufacturing customer s products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in june  cardinal acquired alaris 
alaris manufactures a connector that competes with the clave 
cardinal is the largest distributor of healthcare products in the united states  and the companies have announced their intent to increase market share growth beyond what alaris might be able to achieve on its own 
we believe the ownership of alaris by cardinal could adversely affect our market share and the prices for our clave products 
we believe the success of the clave has motivated  and will continue to motivate others to develop one piece  swabbable  needleless connectors that may incorporate many of the same functional and physical characteristics as the clave 
we are aware of a number of such products 
we have patents covering the technology embodied in the clave and intend to enforce those patents as appropriate 
if we are not successful in enforcing our patents  competition from such products could adversely affect our market share and prices for our clave products 
in response to competitive pressure  we have been reducing prices to protect and expand our market  although overall pricing has been stable recently 
the price reductions to date have been more than offset by increased volume after excluding the effect of hospira s inventory reductions in we expect that the average price of our clave products may continue to decline 
there is no assurance that our current or future products will be able to successfully compete with products developed by others 
the federal needlestick safety and prevention act  enacted in november  modified standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration to require employers to use safety iv systems where appropriate to reduce risk of injury to employees from needlesticks 
we believe this law has had and will continue to have a positive effect on sales of our needleless systems and blood collection needles  although we are unable to quantify the current or anticipated effect of the law on our sales 
we are taking steps to reduce our dependence on our current proprietary products 
we are seeking to substantially expand our custom products business through increased sales to medical product manufacturers and independent distributors 
under one of our hospira agreements  we manufacture all new custom iv sets for sale by hospira and jointly promote the products under the name setsource 
we also contract with group purchasing organizations and independent dealer networks for inclusion of our non critical care products among those available to members of those entities 
custom products accounted for approximately million or of total revenue in  including sales under the hospira setsource program of approximately million and custom critical care products that we manufactured for hospira under the mcda of approximately million 
we expect continued increases in sales of custom products 
punctur guard product revenues in were million 
in and  we invested in a company developing a new medical device 
sales depend on the success of efforts to develop and market the device  and there can be no certainty that those efforts will succeed 
in  we acquired hospira s salt lake city manufacturing facility and entered into the mcda to produce their invasive monitoring  angiography products and certain other products they had manufactured at that facility 
there is no assurance that any of these initiatives will continue to succeed 
we have an ongoing program to increase systems capabilities  improve manufacturing efficiency  reduce labor costs  reduce time needed to produce an order  and minimize investment in inventory 
these include the use of automated assembly equipment for new and existing products  use of larger molds and molding machines  centralization of all proprietary molding in salt lake city  expansion of our production facility in mexico to take over manual assembly currently done in salt lake city  and possibly the establishment of other production facilities outside the us we distribute products through three distribution channels 
product revenues for each distribution channel were as follows channel medical product manufacturers independent domestic distributors international total quarterly results the healthcare business in the united states is subject to seasonal fluctuations  and activity tends to diminish somewhat in the summer months of june  july and august  when illness is less frequent than in winter months and patients tend to postpone elective procedures 
this typically causes seasonal fluctuations in our business 
in addition  we can experience fluctuations in net sales as a result of variations in the ordering patterns of our largest customers  which may be driven more by production scheduling and their inventory levels  and less by seasonality 
our expenses often do not fluctuate in the same manner as net sales  which may cause fluctuations in operating income that are disproportionate to fluctuations in our revenue 
year to year comparisons we present summarized income statement data in item selected financial data 
the following table shows  for the three most recent years  the percentages of each income statement caption in relation to revenues 
we currently calculate our gross profit percentage based on net sales  which includes only product sales and excludes non product revenue such as license fees 
see below for more information on non product revenue 
we present the alternative calculation based on net product revenue for the convenience of readers 
percentage of revenues revenue net sales other total revenues gross profit percentage of net sales percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses total operating expenses income from operations other income income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes minority interest net income comparison of to revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in distribution channels net us sales to hospira in were million  compared to net sales of million in net sales of clave products to hospira  excluding custom clave iv systems increased to million in from million in beginning in the first quarter of  hospira began decreasing its level of purchases to make a substantial reduction in its inventory of clave products  and this reduced buying continued through the remainder of although hospira substantially reduced its purchases  information provided by hospira indicated that its clave unit sales to its customers had continued to increase 
hospira informed us that it had reduced its inventory to the desired level by the end of december hospira s purchases of clave products returned to more normal levels in sales to hospira under the setsource program approximated million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the setsource increase is attributed to unit sales increases in the custom set market 
sales to hospira under the mcda  which began in may  were million or of total revenue 
we expect a significant increase in our sales to hospira in from the inclusion of critical care products for a full year  continuing growth in sales of custom iv systems and a modest percentage growth in clave and other product sales  although there is no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
net sales to independent domestic distributors including canada increased approximately million  from million in to million in independent domestic distributors had a or million increase in custom iv systems and a  or million  increase in clave product sales 
both increases are principally because of an increase in unit volume 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales of punctur guard products due to a decrease in unit sales 
we expect that sales to domestic distributors will increase principally from growth in custom iv system business  with modest growth in sales of other products  although there is no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
net sales to international distributors excluding canada were million in  compared with million in  an increase of 
approximately of the increase was attributable to increased sales in europe  with the balance in asia pacific  latin america and south africa 
the principal product lines showing increases were clave and custom iv systems  both on increased unit volumes 
we expect significant increases in sales to international distributors across all areas and all principal product lines  although there is no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
product and other revenue net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems increased from million in to million in  or 
this increase was primarily due to the resumption in of more normal levels of unit shipments of clave products to hospira  discussed above  which increased million from sales of clave products and custom iv systems including one or more clave connectors combined were million in compared with million in this increase was due to increased purchases of clave products in all our distribution channels 
salt lake city product sales to hospira were million from may to december  which includes critical care sales and custom critical care sales of million 
net sales of custom and generic iv systems increased approximately million  or  to million in over  principally because of increased unit volume 
the setsource program with hospira accounted for approximately million of the increase  domestic distributors accounted for approximately million of the increase and international distributors accounted for the balance of the increase 
unit volume accounted for the majority of the increase 
net sales of punctur guard products excluding royalties were million in compared to million in increased sales to hospira were offset by a decline in sales to domestic distributors 
net sales of clc in were million compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to increases in international sales and sales to hospira 
all distribution channels had increases in sales 
other revenue consists of license  royalty and revenue shares income and was approximately million in and and million in we may receive other license fees or royalties in the future for the use of our technology 
we give no assurance as to amounts or timing of any future payments  or whether such payments will be received 
gross margin for and  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  was and  respectively 
the margin decrease in is due to the addition of the new salt lake city products sold to hospira under the mcda  which began in may and have lower margins than most of our traditional products 
the average gross margins under the mcda were for the eight months since inception on may  excluding the mcda product sales and related cost of goods sold  our margins calculated on net sales were 
the increase in margins from  excluding products under the mcda was primarily due to greater absorbtion of fixed overhead because of increased production and greater sales of higher margin products 
we expect gross margins in to improve to to as we make improvements in the salt lake city plant and progress on the relocation of manufacturing  although there can be no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by million to million  and were of revenues in  as compared with in the increase in costs was partially due to a million increase in expenses associated with patent lawsuits against two companies and a lawsuit against a law firm 
one of the patent lawsuits was settled in april the expenses of those lawsuits aggregated million in compensation and benefit increases accounted for approximately million  principally from increased bonuses  the addition of our salt lake city facility  the addition of new sales personnel and increased compensation 
costs for new product introductions and increased travel costs accounted for approximately million of the increase 
we expect sg a in to be somewhat higher than in  and be approximately to of revenue  principally because of compensation and travel costs for sales personnel 
there can be no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
research and development expenses r d were million in compared to million in the total includes a million charge for in process r d ipr d compared to ipr d of million in both of these ipr d charges were related to our investment in a company developing a new medical device being designed for use in screening for heart disease 
million of costs were incurred by this company in  compared to million in the remaining increase in r d is primarily from new r d activity associated with our new products and new r d activity in our salt lake city facility 
other income increased million to million in compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in overall yield on invested funds and receipt of a million payment under a settlement agreement 
minority interest was million in compared to million in and represents the minority interest share of the net loss of the company developing a new medical device for use in screening heart disease 
income taxes were accrued at an effective tax rate of in compared to in the rate differed from the statutory corporate rate of because of tax credits that are higher than expected on a recurring basis  tax exempt interest and dividends  partially offset by state taxes and losses of a company not included in our consolidated tax return 
the rate was slightly lower than the rate  see below for discussion of the effective tax rate 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately in because of lower tax credits and larger losses of a company not included in our consolidated tax return 
comparison of to in  we had revenues of million  compared to million in distribution channels net sales to hospira were million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
clave sales to hospira decreased million  or to million from million principally because hospira had decreased its level of purchases to make a substantial reduction in its inventory of clave products 
sales to hospira under the setsource program were approximately million in  compared to million in  or a increase 
net sales of the clc to hospira decreased by approximately million  to million in  because hospira was also reducing inventory levels of clc products 
net sales to independent domestic distributors including canada decreased approximately to million in from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in punctur guard product sales  partially offset by million and million of increases in clave and custom iv system sales  respectively 
the decrease in punctur guard product sales is primarily due to a decrease in unit sales and to pricing concessions on our punctur guard products to achieve a wider distribution 
the clave and custom iv system sales increases were both principally due to an increase in unit volume 
net sales in our international markets excluding canada were million in  compared to million in the increase in was due primarily to a million increase in clave and custom iv sales  partially offset by a million decrease in punctur guard product sales 
in  we experienced a slowing of distributor orders while they reduced clave inventory levels 
orders in most of our international markets returned to more normal levels in this and the expansion of our business accounted for the increase in international sales of clave 
the increase of custom iv systems was attributable primarily to an increase in unit volume 
the decrease in sales of punctur guard products is primarily due to a decrease in unit sales and to pricing concessions on our punctur guard products to achieve a wider distribution 
product and other revenue total net sales of clave products excluding custom clave iv systems decreased approximately million or to million in from million in this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in unit shipments of clave products to hospira  partially offset by an increase in unit shipments to our domestic and international distributors 
sales of custom iv systems including one or more clave connectors and clave products combined declined by million from million in to million in the decrease was caused by hospira s lower purchases of clave products 
net sales of custom and generic iv systems  which included custom iv sets  both with a clave and without a clave  were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the setsource program with hospira accounted for approximately of the increase  with most of the balance in sales to independent domestic and international distributors 
the increase is due to continued growth with this product which is because we are able to give the customer customization instead of standard sets at a competitive price 
sales of punctur guard products excluding royalties were million in compared to million for the decline was due to a decrease in unit sales and to pricing concessions to achieve wider distribution 
net sales of the clc declined to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease is due to lower purchases by hospira and a small price decrease 
other revenue in was million compared to million in other revenue in included a one time license fees of million 
gross margin for  calculated on net sales and excluding other revenue  was compared to in in  gross margins were adversely affected by approximately eight percentage points because of the curtailment in production of clave products due to reduced shipments to hospira  which resulted in unabsorbed overhead  approximately three percentage points by punctur guard operations  which have a lower gross margin than most our other products and which were also adversely affected by reduced production levels  and the new facility in italy which was operating substantially below full capacity 
in  gross margins were adversely affected by two temporary factors  the principal one relating to improvements on our automated production in san clemente during the third quarter  which resulted in a period of unabsorbed overhead 
sg a in  increased million to million and was approximately of revenue in as compared with million  or of revenue in the increase was primarily due to increased corporate administrative costs  which was principally comprised of million of costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  million of non recurring patent amortization  and increased information technology costs  partially offset by a reduction in costs from our connecticut office r d in were million or of revenue compared to million  or of revenue  in the increase was primarily comprised of million of in process r d related to the investment in a company developing a new medical device and the costs of million incurred by this company from september through december  post acquisition 
other income increased million in as compared with  principally because of an increase in invested funds including finance loans and an increase in overall yield 
income taxes our effective income tax rate in was  a decrease from in the decrease was principally because tax exempt interest and dividends were a higher proportion or income before income taxes  thereby reducing the overall rate  and state tax credits  those reductions were partially offset by the effect of losses of the company developing the new medical device because those losses are not included in our consolidated tax return 
liquidity and capital resources during  our cash and liquid investments were virtually unchanged 
operating activities generated million cash 
we received another million from our stock plans  and million from finance loan repayments 
this was offset by the million spent on purchasing the salt lake city facility and million in purchases of property and equipment 
operating activities our cash provided by operating activities tends to increase over time because of our positive operating results 
however  it is subject to fluctuations  principally from the impact of integrating new locations from acquisitions  changes in net income  accounts receivable  inventories  the timing of tax payments and tax benefits from exercise of stock options 
accounts receivable increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million 
approximately of the increase was due to new receivables with hospira under the mcda 
the remaining increase is principally because revenue excluding sales to hospira under the mcda in fourth quarter of was more than revenue in the fourth quarter of  offset by cash collections because shipments were spread relatively evenly over each month of the fourth quarter of we generally try to maintain a minimal amount of inventory of finished goods and work in process  but will maintain larger amounts of components classified as raw material acquired from third parties to avoid production delays if deliveries by our suppliers are late 
the salt lake city plant requires more raw material and work in process inventories in relation to sales because of the relatively large number of different products produced and relatively long production cycles 
our inventory balance increased by million from december  because of an increase of million in raw material and work in process  partially offset by a decrease of million in finished goods 
on may   we acquired million of raw material and work in process inventory as part of the purchase of the salt lake city facility from hospira 
at december   we had million of raw material and work in process inventory in our salt lake facility  which accounted for most of the million increase 
on december   our finished goods inventory was million because we had increased inventory in anticipation of higher sales levels in the latter part of which did not materialize 
that extra inventory has all been sold  but we have had a modest increase as we build a buffer stock of inventory in preparation for our move of production from san clemente to salt lake city  resulting in a net decrease in finished goods inventory of million 
we expect to increase inventories further through the first half of to provide additional buffer stocks before moving production 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets includes a million non trade receivable associated with certain december stock option exercises being remitted to us from the broker  the payment was received in january also included in prepaid expenses and other assets is a million non trade receivable due from hospira for costs associated with the mcda 
accrued expenses increased from million at december  to million at december  approximately million of this increase was comprised of compensation and benefit accruals associated with our employees at our new manufacturing facility in salt lake city 
the remaining increase is primarily comprised of increased compensation and benefit accruals and accrued exit costs associated with the relocation of our san clemente manufacturing facility to our salt lake city manufacturing facility 
the tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  which we believe are more properly related to the sale of our stock which is a financing activity  fluctuates based principally on when employees choose to exercise their vested stock options 
tax benefits from the exercise of stock options in were million on the exercise of options to acquire  shares as compared to million in on the exercise of options to acquire  shares 
on january   when we adopt provisions of sfas r  on accounting for share based payments  these tax benefits will be reflected in financing activities to the extent they are tax benefits in excess of the tax effect of stock option based compensation recognized for financial reporting 
we expect our sales will continue to grow in compared to as sales increase  working capital is expected to increase to fund the increase in operations 
investing activities during the  we used cash of million in investing activities 
this was comprised of cash paid for acquired assets of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  offset by the net proceeds from sales of liquid investments of million and proceeds from finance loan payments of million 
we are moving all molding and automated assembly to our salt lake city facility from our san clemente and connecticut facilities  which will require improvements to our salt lake city facility 
in addition  we are expanding our production facility in mexico by  square feet to take over most of the manual assembly currently done in our salt lake city facility 
the above moves began in july and we expect them to be completed by early we estimate that capital expenditures in  including the building improvements in our salt lake city and mexico facilities  will be approximately million 
amounts of spending are estimates and actual spending may substantially differ from those amounts 
icu finance  inc is a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary that we established in as a licensed commercial lender to provide financing to companies involved in distribution of healthcare products and provision of healthcare services 
loans were made only to credit worthy healthcare entities and are fully secured by real and personal property 
at december   million in loans were outstanding 
scheduled maturities are million  million and million 
weighted average maturity principal and interest at december  was years and the weighted average interest rate was 
there were no unfunded commitments at december  financing activities cash provided by stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  excluding tax benefits  was million in to purchase  shares compared to million to purchase  shares in in  we acquired our own common stock for million 
we did not acquire shares of our common stock in  however  we may purchase our shares in the future 
future purchases of our common stock  if any  will depend on market conditions and other factors 
we have a substantial cash and liquid investment position generated from profitable operations and stock sales  principally from the exercise of employee stock options 
we maintain this position to fund our growth  meet increasing working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  and to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that may arise 
our primary investment goal is capital preservation  as further described in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our liquid investments have very little credit risk or market risk 
we believe that our existing cash and liquid investments along with funds expected to be generated from future operations will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our current operations for the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we have agreed to indemnify officers and directors of the company to the maximum extent permitted under delaware law and to indemnify customers as to certain intellectual property matters related to sales of our products 
there is no maximum limit on the indemnification that may be required under these agreements 
we have never incurred  nor do we expect to incur  any liability for indemnification 
except for indemnification agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations of approximately the following amounts 
these amounts exclude purchase orders for goods and services for current delivery 
the majority of our purchase orders are blanket purchase orders that represent an estimated forecast of goods and services 
we do not have a commitment liability on the blanket purchase orders 
since we do not have the ability to separate out blanket purchase orders from non blanket purchase orders for goods and services for current delivery  these amounts are excluded from the table below 
the commitments under the mcda include commitments to fund certain research and development to improve critical care products and develop new products for sale to hopsira and to provide sales specialists focused on critical care

the kinds of statements described above and similar forward looking statements about our future performance are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which one should consider in evaluating the statements 
first  one should consider the factors and risks described in the statements themselves 
those factors are uncertain  and if one or more of them turn out differently than we currently expect  our operating results may differ materially from our current expectations 
second  one should read the forward looking statements in conjunction with the risk factors in item a of this annual report to the securities and exchange commission 
also  our actual future operating results are subject to other important factors that we cannot predict or control  including among others the following general economic and business conditions  the effect of price and safety considerations on the healthcare industry  competitive factors  such as product innovation  new technologies  marketing and distribution strength and price erosion  unanticipated market shifts and trends  the impact of legislation affecting government reimbursement of healthcare costs  changes by our major customers and independent distributors in their strategies that might affect their efforts to market our products  unanticipated production problems  and the availability of patent protection and the cost of enforcing and of defending patent claims 
we disclaim any obligation to update the statements or to announce publicly the result of any revision to any of the statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have a portfolio of corporate preferred stocks and federal tax exempt state and municipal government debt securities 
the securities are all investment grade and we believe that we have virtually no exposure to credit risk 
dividend and interest rates reset at auction for most of the securities at seven to forty nine day intervals  with some longer but none beyond twelve months  so we have very little market risk  that is  risk that the fair value of the security will change because of changes in market interest rates  they are readily saleable at par at auction dates  and can normally be sold at par between auction dates 
as of december   we had no declines in the market values of these securities 
our future earnings are subject to potential increase or decrease because of changes in short term interest rates 
generally  each one percentage point change in the discount rate will cause our overall yield to change by two thirds to three quarters of a percentage point  depending upon the relative mix of federal tax exempt securities and corporate preferred stocks in the portfolio and market conditions specific to the securities in which we invest 
at december  we had outstanding commercial loans of approximately million 
loans were made only to credit worthy parties and are fully secured by real and personal property 
we plan to hold the loans until maturity or payoff 
maturities are three years or less and the weighted average maturity principal and interest payments is years 
because of the relatively small amount of the commercial loans  market risk is not significant to our financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk for financial instruments on our balance sheet  which consist of cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable  is not significant to our financial statements 
sales from the us and mexico to foreign distributors are all denominated in us dollars 
we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities in several countries and we conduct business transactions denominated in various foreign currencies  principally the euro  british pound  and mexican peso 
cash and receivables in those countries have been insignificant and are generally offset by accounts payable in the same foreign currency  except for italy  where our net euro position at december  was approximately million 
we expect that in the future  with the growth of our european distribution operation  that net euro denominated instruments will continue to increase 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
our exposure to commodity price changes relates primarily to certain manufacturing operations that use resin 
we manage our exposure to changes in those prices through our procurement and supply chain management practices and the effect of price changes has not been material 
we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale  and all such materials and products are readily available
