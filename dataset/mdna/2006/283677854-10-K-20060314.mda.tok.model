environmental matters the company is subject to regulation with respect to air  soil and water quality  solid waste disposal and other environmental matters by federal  state  tribal and local authorities 
those authorities govern current facility operations and have continuing jurisdiction over facility modifications 
failure to comply with these environmental regulatory requirements can result in actions by regulatory agencies or other authorities that might seek to impose on the company administrative  civil  and or criminal penalties 
if the united states regulates green house gas emissions  the company s fossil fuel generation assets will be faced with the additional cost of monitoring  controlling and reporting these emissions 
because a significant portion of the company s generation assets is nuclear and gas fired  the company does not believe such regulations would impose greater burdens on the company than on most other electric utilities 
in addition  unauthorized releases of pollutants or contaminants into the environment

natural gas the company manages its natural gas requirements through a combination of a long term supply contract and spot market purchases 
the long term supply contract provides for firm deliveries of gas at market based index prices 
in  the company s natural gas requirements at the rio grande power station were met with both short term and long term natural gas purchases from various suppliers and it is expected to continue in interstate gas is delivered under a base firm transportation contract 
the company anticipates it will continue to purchase natural gas at spot market prices on a monthly basis for a portion of the fuel needs for the rio grande power station for the near term 
the company will continue to evaluate the availability of short term natural gas supplies versus long term supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the rio grande power station 
natural gas for the newman and copper power stations is primarily supplied pursuant to an intrastate natural gas contract that expires in the company will also continue to evaluate short term natural gas supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the newman and copper power stations 
coal aps  as operating agent for four corners  purchases four corners coal requirements from a supplier with a long term lease of coal reserves owned by the navajo nation 
the four corners coal contract expires in which coincides with the term of the four corners plant lease with the navajo nation 
based upon information from aps  the company believes that four corners has sufficient reserves of coal to meet the plant s operational requirements for its useful life 
in the third quarter of  upon participant approval of a study conducted by an outside engineering firm  the company decreased its estimated final reclamation and coal mine closure liability related to the company s interest in four corners from million to million

index to financial statements regulation general in  both the texas and new mexico legislatures enacted electric utility industry restructuring laws requiring competition in certain functions of the industry and ultimately in the company s service area 
in texas  the company was exempt from the requirements of the texas restructuring law  including utility restructuring and retail competition until the expiration of the original texas freeze period  which occurred in august the texas commission adopted a rule that further delays competition in the company s texas service territory until at least the time that an independent regional transmission organization rto begins operation in its relevant power markets 
in april  the new mexico restructuring act was repealed and as a result  the company s operations in new mexico will continue to be fully regulated 
the company cannot predict at this time the effect electric restructuring will have on the company should it be required to ultimately implement the texas restructuring law 
federal regulatory matters federal energy regulatory commission 
the ferc has been conducting an investigation into potential manipulation of electricity prices in the western united states during and on august   the ferc initiated a federal power act fpa investigation into the company s wholesale power trading in the western united states during and to determine whether the company and enron engaged in misconduct and  if so  to determine potential remedies 
the company reached settlements with the ferc and other parties in and the company believes the ferc s order approving the settlement resolved all issues between the ferc and the other parties to this investigation 
under the settlements  the company agreed to refund million and to make wholesale sales pursuant to its cost of service rate authority rather than its market based rate authority for the period december  through december  this agreement allowed the company to sell power into wholesale markets at its incremental cost plus per mwh 
to the extent that wholesale market prices exceeded these agreed upon amounts  the company lost the opportunity to realize these additional revenues 
this provision did not have a significant impact on the company s revenues through december  the company s ability to make wholesale sales pursuant to its market based rate authority was restored on january  rtos 
ferc s rule order on rtos strongly encourages  but does not require  public utilities to form and join rtos 
the company is an active participant in the development of westconnect  formerly known as the desert southwest transmission and reliability operator 
a westconnect memorandum of understanding mou  replacing the october  mou  was signed by the company and nine other transmission owners on december  on november  an eleventh member joined 
this mou obligates the parties to participate in and commit resources to ongoing joint efforts  including involvement with stakeholders  customers  local  state and federal regulatory personnel  and other western grid transmission providers to identify  develop and implement cost effective wholesale market enhancements on a voluntary  phased in basis to add value in transmission accessibility  wholesale market efficiency and reliability for wholesale users of the western grid 
these enhancements may ultimately include formation of an rto 
westconnect will continue to work with the ferc and two other proposed rtos in the west to achieve a seamless market structure

index to financial statements the company  however  is approximately a participant in westconnect and cannot control the terms or timing of its development 
westconnect as an rto will not be operational for several years 
the establishment of an independent rto in the company s service area is a prerequisite for the company to be considered part of a qualified power region as defined in the texas restructuring law 
the timing of the operations of westconnect will affect when and whether the company s texas service territory is deregulated under the texas restructuring law

the texas commission has exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review municipal orders and ordinances regarding rates and services within municipalities in texas and original jurisdiction over certain other activities of the company 
the decisions of the texas commission are subject to judicial review 
deregulation 
the texas restructuring law required certain investor owned electric utilities to separate power generation activities and retail service activities from transmission and distribution activities by january   and on that date  retail competition for generation services was instituted in some parts of texas 
the texas restructuring law  however  specifically recognized and preserved the company s texas rate stipulation and texas settlement agreement by  among other things  exempting the company s texas service area from retail competition until the end of the freeze period 
on october   the texas commission approved a rule further delaying retail competition in the company s texas service territory 
the rule approved by the texas commission sets a schedule which identifies various milestones for the company to reach before competition can begin 
the first milestone calls for the development  approval by the ferc  and commencement of independent operation of an rto in the area that includes the company s service territory  including the development of retail market protocols to facilitate retail competition 
the complete transition to retail competition would occur upon the completion of the last milestone  which would be the texas commission s final evaluation of the market s readiness to offer fair competition and reliable service to all retail customers 
the company believes that adoption of this rule will likely delay retail competition in el paso for a number of years 
there is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market 
table of contents 
index to financial statements conditions that will exist if and when retail competition is implemented in the company s service territory  and the company may incur substantial preparatory  restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable 
there can be no assurance that deregulation would not adversely affect the future operations  cash flows and financial condition of the company 
renewables and energy efficiency programs 
notwithstanding the texas commission s approval of a rule further delaying competition in the company s texas service territory  the company became subject to the renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements of the texas restructuring law on january  under the renewable energy requirements  the company will have to annually obtain its pro rata share of renewable energy credits as determined by the program administrator the electric reliability council of texas appointed by the texas commission  based on total texas retail sales subject to renewable energy credit allocation 
during the session of the texas legislature  the statewide obligation to increase renewable energy capacity was raised from an additional  mw by to an additional  mw of additional renewable generating capacity in texas by the company s ultimate obligation to obtain renewable energy credits will not be known until january of the year following the compliance year  and it will have until march to obtain  if necessary  and submit to the program administrator  sufficient credits 
the company estimates that its texas retail sales will represent approximately of the total credit allocation through in addition  by january   the company will be required to fund incentives for energy efficiency savings that will achieve the goal of meeting of its growth in demand through energy efficiency savings 
by january  and every year thereafter  that goal is of the company s growth in demand through energy efficiency savings 
preparatory costs incurred by the company to meet these requirements may not be recoverable in the company s texas service territory during the new texas freeze period which expires june pursuant to the company s energy efficiency plan filed with the texas commission  the company estimates it will incur million in costs through for incentive payments to achieve its energy efficiency goal 
new texas freeze period and franchise agreement 
on july   the company entered into an agreement with the city  the city rate agreement  to extend its existing freeze period for an additional five years expiring june   the new texas freeze period 
under the city rate agreement which became effective as of july   most retail base rates will remain at their current level for the next five years 
if  during the term of the agreement  the company s return on equity falls below the bottom of a defined range  the company has the right to initiate a rate case and seek an adjustment to base rates 
if the company s return on equity exceeds the top of the range  the company will refund  at the city s direction  an amount equal to of the pre tax return in excess of the ceiling 
the range is market based  and at current rates  would be a range of approximately to pursuant to the city rate agreement  the company will share with its texas customers of off system sales margins and wheeling revenues 
under the prior rate agreement  the company shared of off system sales margins and wheeling revenues with texas customers 
the city rate agreement requires a variance to the substantive rules of the texas commission regarding the sharing of margins 
the company has sought texas commission approval in puc docket no 
filed on january  of the margin sharing provisions of the agreement 
if the texas commission does not approve the margin sharing provisions of the city rate agreement  the company and the city have agreed to negotiate in good faith to amend the rate agreement to achieve a similar economic result to the

the company and the city have agreed to engage at the company s expense the services of an independent consultant to review the reasonableness of certain operating expenses of the company 
if the consultant finds such expenses to be unreasonable  the parties will seek to negotiate an appropriate remedy 
if the parties are unable to agree on a remedy  the agreement will terminate at the end of one year  and  thereafter  the company would be subject to traditional rate regulation 
the city has retained a consultant to conduct this review which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of consistent with the prior rate agreement  the city rate agreement may also be reopened by the city in the event of a merger or change in control of the company to seek rate reductions based on post merger synergy savings 
the city also granted to the company a new year franchise which became effective august  and increased franchise fee payments from to of gross receipts earned within the city limits

fuel and purchased power costs 
although the company s base rates are frozen under the city rate agreement  pursuant to texas commission rules and the city rate agreement  the company s fuel costs are passed through to its customers 
in january and july of each year  the company can request adjustments to its fuel factor to more accurately reflect projected energy costs associated with providing electricity  seek recovery of past undercollections of fuel revenues  and refund past overcollections of fuel revenues 
all such fuel revenue and expense activities are subject to periodic final review by the texas commission in fuel reconciliation proceedings 
the company reconciled its texas jurisdictional fuel costs for the period january  through december  in puc docket no 
 and on may   the texas commission issued its final order 
at issue was the company s request to recover an additional million  before interest  from its texas customers as a surcharge due to fuel undercollections from january through december the texas commission disallowed approximately million of texas jurisdictional expenses  before interest  consisting primarily of i approximately million of purchased power expenses which the texas commission characterized as imputed capacity charges  and ii approximately million in fees which were deemed to be administrative costs  not recoverable as fuel 
this disallowance was recorded as a reduction of fuel revenue during the fourth quarter of in texas  capacity charges are not eligible for recovery as fuel expenses but are to be recovered through the company s base rates 
as the company s base rates were frozen during the period in which the imputed capacity charges were deemed to have been incurred  the million of imputed capacity charges were therefore permanently disallowed and not recoverable from its texas customers 
the texas commission s decision has been appealed by two parties and the company  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the appeals

fuel and purchased power costs associated with the remaining of the company s jurisdictional retail sales in new mexico are fixed at per kwh 
on august   the company filed the annual reconciliation of its fuel and purchased power cost adjustment clause fppcac for the period june  through may  in compliance with the requirements of the nmprc s final order in nmprc case no 
ut 
the company requested reconciliation of all its fuel and purchased power costs for this period  and requested recovery of million for the new mexico jurisdictional portion of purchased power capacity costs consistent with its interpretation of nmprc rules 
however  the company has not recognized deferred fuel revenue through december to reflect recovery of these costs pending a final order in the case 
although a hearing date has not been established for this proceeding  the company expects a final order in this case in the first half of while the company believes that it has fully supported the recovery of all of its applicable fuel and purchased power costs  the company cannot predict when or how the nmprc will rule on this case 
an adverse ruling by the nmprc could have a material negative effect on the company s results of operations 
renewables 
the new mexico renewable energy act of requires that  by january   renewable energy comprise no less than of the company s total retail sales to new mexico customers

risk factors like other companies in our industry  our consolidated financial results will be impacted by weather  the economy of our service territory  fuel prices  the performance of our customers and the decisions of regulatory agencies 
our common stock price and creditworthiness will be affected by national and international macroeconomic trends  general market conditions and the expectations of the investment community  all of which are largely beyond our control 
in addition  the following statements highlight risk factors that may affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
these are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks  and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the sec 
our costs could increase or we could experience reduced revenues if there are problems at the palo verde nuclear generating station a significant percentage of our generating capacity  off system sales margins  assets and operating expenses is attributable to palo verde 
our interest in each of the three palo verde units total approximately mw of generating capacity 
palo verde represents approximately of our available net generating capacity and represented approximately of our available energy for the twelve months ended december  palo verde comprises of our total net plant in service and palo verde expenses comprise a significant portion of operation and maintenance expenses 
we face the risk of additional or unanticipated costs at palo verde resulting from i increases in operation and maintenance expenses  ii the replacement of steam generators in palo verde unit  iii the replacement of reactor vessel heads at the palo verde units  iv an extended outage of any of the palo verde units  v increases in estimates of decommissioning costs  vi the storage of radioactive waste  including spent nuclear fuel  vii prolonged reductions in generating output  viii insolvency of other palo verde participants  and ix compliance with the various requirements and regulations governing commercial nuclear generating stations 
at the same time  our retail base rates in texas are effectively capped through june as a result  we cannot raise our base rates in texas in the event of increases in non fuel costs or loss of revenue unless our return on equity falls below the bottom of a market based defined range in which the bottom of the range is approximately 
additionally  should retail competition occur  there may be competitive pressure on our rates which could reduce profitability 
we cannot assure that revenues will be sufficient to recover any increased costs  including any increased costs in connection with palo verde or other operations  whether as a result of inflation  changes in tax laws or regulatory requirements  or other causes 
typically  the company realizes between and of its off system sales margins during the first quarter of each calendar year when the company s native load is lower than at other times of the years  allowing for the sale in the wholesale market of relatively larger amounts of off system energy generated from nuclear fuel resources 
palo verde s availability is an important factor in realizing these off system sales margins 
the company estimates that the reduced output and upcoming outages at palo verde unit  together with lower than originally forecast wholesale energy prices  will result in reduced off system sales margins of approximately to million for the period january through july the company cautions that results would differ from its estimates to the extent that actual market prices  palo verde unit operations and other factors vary from its assumptions 
the adverse financial impact on the company from continued reduced output and outages at palo verde unit could increase and would include foregone off system margins  higher capital and or operating costs and increased purchased power and other costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our city rate agreement with el paso could terminate early under our city rate agreement  we agreed to engage the services of an independent consultant to review the reasonableness of certain operating expenses 
if the consultant finds such expenses to be unreasonable  the parties will seek to negotiate an appropriate remedy 
if the parties are unable to agree on a remedy  the new texas freeze period would expire on june  if that were to occur  we would be subject to traditional rate regulation by the city with appellate review by the texas commission beginning july  in such event  there can be no assurance that we would be able to maintain our texas rates thereafter 
in addition  the early termination of the new texas freeze period or denial by the texas commission to approve the fuel provision of the city rate agreement may mean that we would not be entitled to retain of our margins from off system sales retroactive to july  if litigated rate regulation leads to lower rates or reduced off system sales margin retention  there would be a potential material negative impact on our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position 
we may not be able to pass through all of our fuel expenses to customers in general  by law  we are entitled to pass through our prudently incurred fuel and purchased power expenses to our customers in texas and new mexico 
nevertheless  we agreed in to a fixed fuel factor for ten percent of the kilowatt hours of our retail customers in new mexico pursuant to a base rate freeze that expires in this agreement also allows us to price a portion of power from palo verde unit at market prices which tend to track gas prices 
to the extent that this indirect hedge does not perfectly track our costs  we are subject to the risk of increased costs of fuel that would not be recoverable 
the portion of fuel expense that is not fixed is subject to reconciliation by the texas commission and the nmprc 
prior to the completion of a reconciliation  we record fuel transactions such that fuel revenues equal fuel expense except for the portion fixed in new mexico 
in the event that a disallowance occurs during a reconciliation proceeding  the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers and we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance 
in new mexico  the fuel adjustment clause allows us to reflect current fuel cost in the fuel clause and to recover under recoveries and refund over recoveries with a two month lag 
in texas  fuel costs are recovered through a fixed fuel factor that may be adjusted two times per year 
if we materially under recover fuel costs  we may seek a surcharge to recover those costs at the time of the next fuel factor filing 
during periods of significant increases in natural gas prices such as occurred in and  the company realizes a lag in the ability to reflect increases in fuel costs in its fuel recovery mechanisms 
as a result  the cash flow is impacted due to the lag in payment of fuel costs and collection of fuel costs from customers 
at december  and december   the company had deferred fuel balances of million and million  respectively 
a surcharge to collect fuel under recoveries of million over a month period was placed into effect in texas in october a second surcharge was placed into effect on an interim basis in texas in february to collect million over a twelve month period 
to the extent the fuel recovery processes in texas and new mexico do not provide for the timely recovery of fuel costs  the company could experience a material negative impact on its cash flow 
to insure that we have adequate liquidity we have recently begun the process of replacing our million revolving credit facility with a new million revolving credit facility 
the new revolving credit facility will have similar terms to the existing revolving credit facility and will provide up to million for nuclear fuel purchases with any amounts not borrowed for nuclear fuel purchases 
table of contents 
index to financial statements available for use for working capital 
the company expects  but has no assurance  that the new revolving credit facility will be in place by the second quarter of equipment failures and other external factors can adversely affect our results the generation and transmission of electricity require the use of expensive and complex equipment 
while we have a maintenance program in place  generating plants are subject to unplanned outages because of equipment failure 
we are particularly vulnerable to this due to the advanced age of several of our gas fired generating units in or near el paso 
in addition  we are seeking to extend the lives of these plants 
in the event of unplanned outages  we must acquire power from others at unpredictable costs in order to supply our customers and comply with our contractual agreements 
this can materially increase our costs and prevent us from selling excess power at wholesale  thus reducing our profits 
in addition  decisions or mistakes by other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power  thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives 
we are particularly vulnerable to this because a significant portion of our available energy at palo verde and four corners is located hundreds of miles from el paso and las cruces and must be delivered to our customers over long distance transmission lines 
these factors  as well as weather  interest rates  economic conditions  fuel prices and price volatility  are largely beyond our control  but may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings  cash flows and financial position 
competition and deregulation could result in a loss of customers and increased costs as a result of changes in federal law  our wholesale and large retail customers already have  in varying degrees  alternate sources of economical power  including co generation of electric power 
texas has recently passed industry deregulation legislation requiring us to separate our transmission and distribution functions  which would remain regulated  from our power generation and energy services businesses  which would operate in a competitive market  in the future 
on october   the texas commission approved a rule delaying retail competition in our texas service territory 
there is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that would exist if and when retail competition is implemented in our texas service territory  and we may incur substantial preparatory  restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable 
there can be no assurance that deregulation would not adversely affect our future operations  cash flows and financial condition

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates note a to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented and actual results could differ in future periods from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require complex  subjective judgments and include the following sfas no 
collection of fuel expense value of net utility plant in service decommissioning costs and estimated asset retirement obligation future pension and other postretirement obligations reserves for tax dispute sfas no 
regulated electric utilities typically prepare their financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
under this accounting standard  certain recoverable costs are shown as either assets or liabilities on a utility s balance sheet if the regulator provides assurance that these costs will be charged to and collected from the utility s customers or has already permitted such cost recovery 
the resulting regulatory assets or liabilities are amortized in subsequent periods based upon their respective amortization periods in a utility s cost of service 
beginning in  we discontinued the application of sfas no 
to our financial statements 
this decision was based on our determination that our rates were no longer designed to recover our costs of providing service to customers 
upon emerging from bankruptcy in  we again concluded that we did not meet the criteria for applying sfas no 
because of the ten year rate freeze in texas and our ongoing intention not to seek changes in our new mexico rates  which had been established in although we believe the rates established in were based upon our costs of service  the unusual length of the rate freeze period created substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate recovery of our costs over the entire freeze period 
consequently  we determined that we should not re apply sfas no 
to our texas and new mexico jurisdictions at the time we emerged from bankruptcy in february during  we determined that we met the criteria necessary to re apply sfas no 
to our new mexico jurisdictional operations 
two key events transpired in new mexico that  when considered together  resulted in our decision to re apply sfas no 
in april of  we received a final order approving a unanimous stipulation which established new base and fuel rates for our new mexico customers which were implemented june  our approved rates were based upon our cost of providing service in new mexico 
that event  coupled with the repeal of new mexico s electric utility 
table of contents 
index to financial statements industry restructuring law which occurred in april of  resulted in us meeting the criteria for the re application of sfas no 
to new mexico  beginning july  the re application of sfas no 
to our new mexico jurisdiction resulted in the recording of million of regulatory assets  million in related accumulated deferred income tax assets  million of regulatory liabilities  million in related accumulated deferred tax liabilities and a million extraordinary gain  net of tax  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
we have not reapplied sfas no 
to our texas jurisdiction 
however  we are currently evaluating the re application of sfas no 
to our texas jurisdiction based upon the expiration of the ten year rate freeze in texas  the delay of retail competition in  and a new rate settlement agreement with the city of el paso 
in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with the city city rate agreement which provides for a new rate freeze new texas freeze period until june  the city rate agreement specifically provides for our rates to be cost based 
if our return on equity falls below a range around a calculated return on equity under current market conditions during the new texas freeze period  we may seek to increase rates 
likewise  if our return on equity exceeds the range  of the excess must be paid to the city 
the city rate agreement provides for the city to conduct a review of our operating expenses and provides for revision of the rate agreement if they are not determined to be within a reasonable range compared to the utility industry 
also  the city rate agreement allows us to retain of off system sales margins rather than the previous 
while the city rate agreement has been approved by the city  in order to fully implement the agreement  the texas commission must approve the sharing of off system sales margin provisions of the agreement and  in effect  the entire agreement for the texas customers outside the city 
once the city rate agreement is approved by the texas commission  we will complete the evaluation as to whether sfas no 
should be re applied to our texas jurisdiction 
the re application of sfas no 
will result in the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  the re application of sfas no 
will have no effect on our cash flow 
collection of fuel expense in general  through regulation  our fuel and purchased power expenses are passed through to our customers 
as discussed later  in times of rising fuel prices  we experience a lag in recovery of higher fuel costs 
these costs are subject to reconciliation by the texas commission and the nmprc 
prior to the completion of a reconciliation  we record fuel transactions such that fuel revenues equal fuel expense except for the fixed portion in new mexico 
in the event that a disallowance occurs during a reconciliation proceeding  the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers  and we could incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance 
value of net utility plant in service in  when we emerged from bankruptcy  we recast our financial statements by applying fresh start reporting in accordance with statement of position financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
in this process  we attributed value to our integrated utility system after we had established the value of our pro forma capital structure based on management s estimates of future operating results 
we valued our assets such that the depreciated value of our assets would be approximately equal to their estimated fair value at the end of the freeze period 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the depreciation of the fresh start asset value was completed in july if at any time we determine that estimated  undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations of our assets are not sufficient to recover their net book value  then we will be required to write down the value of these assets to their fair values 
any such writedown would be charged to earnings 
we currently believe that our rates are sufficient and that future net cash flows from our assets will be sufficient to recover their net book values 
decommissioning costs and estimated asset retirement obligation pursuant to the anpp participation agreement and federal law  we must fund our share of the estimated costs to decommission palo verde units  and and associated common areas 
we recorded a liability and a corresponding asset for the fair value of our decommissioning obligation upon implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we will adjust the liability to its present value periodically over time  and the corresponding asset will be depreciated over its useful life 
the determination of the estimated liability requires the use of various assumptions pertaining to decommissioning costs  escalation and discount rates 
we and other palo verde participants rely upon decommissioning cost studies and make discount rate  rate of return and inflation projections to determine funding requirements and estimate liabilities related to decommissioning 
every third year outside engineers perform a study to estimate decommissioning costs associated with palo verde units  and and associated common areas 
we determine how we will fund our share of those estimated costs by making assumptions about future investment returns and future decommissioning cost escalations 
the funds are invested in professionally managed investment trust accounts 
we are required to establish a minimum accumulation and a minimum funding level in our decommissioning trust accounts at the end of each annual reporting period in accordance with the anpp participation agreement 
if actual decommissioning costs exceed our estimates  we would incur additional costs related to decommissioning 
further  if the rates of return earned by the trusts fail to meet expectations  we will be required to increase our funding to the decommissioning trust accounts 
although we cannot predict the results of future studies  we believe that the liability we have recorded for our decommissioning costs will be adequate to fund our share of the costs  assuming that palo verde units  and operate over their remaining lives which includes an assessment of the probability of a license extension and that the doe assumes responsibility for permanent disposal of spent fuel at plant shut down 
we believe that our current annual funding levels of the decommissioning trust will adequately provide for the cash requirements associated with decommissioning 
historically  regulated utilities like us have been permitted to collect in rates in texas and new mexico the costs of nuclear decommissioning 
should we become subject to the texas restructuring law  we will be able to collect from regulated transmission and distribution customers the costs of decommissioning 
reference is made to note d  accounting for asset retirement obligations to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
future pension and other postretirement obligations our obligations to retirees under various benefit plans are recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
our liability is calculated on the basis of significant assumptions regarding discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and health care cost inflation 
our assumptions as well as a sensitivity analysis of the effect of hypothetical changes in certain assumptions are set forth in detail in note k  employee benefits  to the notes to consolidated 
table of contents 
index to financial statements financial statements 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on both net income and on the amount of liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
in developing the assumptions  management makes judgments based on the advice of financial and actuarial advisors and our review of third party and market based data 
these sources include life expectancy tables  surveys of compensation and health care cost trends  and historical and expected return data on various categories of plan assets 
the assumed discount rate applied to future plan obligations is based at each measuring date on prevailing market interest rates inherent in high quality aa and better corporate bonds that would provide future cash flow needed to pay the benefits as they become due  as well as on publicly available bond issues 
we regularly review our assumptions and conduct a reassessment at least once a year 
we do not expect that any such change in assumptions will have a material effect on net income for reserves for tax dispute our federal income tax returns for the years through have been examined by the internal revenue service irs 
on may   we received a notice of proposed deficiency from the irs 
the primary audit adjustments proposed by the irs related to i whether we were entitled to currently deduct payments related to the repair of the palo verde unit steam generators or whether these payments should be capitalized and depreciated and ii whether we were entitled to currently deduct payments related to the dry cask storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel or whether these payments should be capitalized and depreciated 
the proposed irs adjustments go to the timing of these deductions not their ultimate deductibility for federal tax purposes 
we have protested the audit adjustments through administrative appeals and believe that our treatment of the payments is supported by substantial legal authority 
in the event that the irs prevails  the resulting income tax and interest payments could be material to our cash flows

index to financial statements historical results of operations the following discussion includes detailed descriptions of factors affecting individual line items in the results of operations 
the amounts presented below are presented on a pre tax basis 
operating revenues we realize revenue from the sale of electricity to retail customers at regulated rates and the sale of energy in the wholesale power market generally at market based prices 
sales for resale which are wholesale sales within our service territory accounted for less than of revenues 
off system sales are wholesale sales into markets outside our service territory 
off system sales are primarily made in off peak periods when we have competitive generation capacity available after meeting our regulated service obligations 
under the terms of our city rate agreement  we share with our texas customers of our off system sales margins and wheeling revenues 
revenues from the sale of electricity include fuel costs  which are substantially passed through to customers through fuel adjustment mechanisms in texas and new mexico and a portion through base revenues in new mexico 
we record deferred fuel revenues for the difference between fuel costs and fuel revenues until such amounts are collected from or refunded to customers 
base revenues refers to our revenues from the sale of electricity excluding such fuel costs except for a portion of fuel costs in new mexico 
retail base revenues 
retail base revenues increased by million or for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the same period in retail kilowatt hour sales in the twelve month period ended december  were higher than the twelve month period ended december  a growth in the average number of retail customers served in accounted for most of the growth in sales 
while hotter weather in the summer of increased cooling degree days resulted in higher sales  they were offset by milder weather conditions earlier in decreased heating degree days 
retail base revenues increased by million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the same period in retail kilowatt hour sales in the twelve month period ended december  were higher than the twelve month period ended december  a growth in the average number of retail customers served in accounted for most of the growth in sales 
cooler weather in the summer of decreased cooling degree days resulted in lower sales and were only partially offset by the colder winter months increased heating degree days

index to financial statements retail base revenue percentages by customer class are presented below twelve months ended december  residential commercial and industrial  small commercial and industrial  large sales to public authorities total base revenues no retail customer accounted for more than of our base revenues during such periods 
as shown in the table above  residential and small commercial customers comprise of our revenues 
while this customer base is more stable  it is also more sensitive to changes in weather conditions 
as a result  our business is seasonal  with higher revenues during the summer cooling season 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our revenues derived during each quarter for the periods presented years ended december  january to march april to june july to september october to december total heating and cooling degree days can be used to evaluate the effect of weather on energy use 
for each degree the average outdoor temperature varies from a standard of degrees fahrenheit a degree day is recorded 
as shown in the table below  combined heating and cooling degree days were below average in and year average heating degree days cooling degree days fuel revenues 
fuel revenues consists of two parts  revenues collected from customers under fuel recovery mechanisms approved by the state commissions  and deferred fuel revenues which are comprised of the difference between fuel costs and fuel revenues collected from customers 
in new mexico  the fuel adjustment clause allows us to reflect current fuel costs in the clause and to recover under or refund over recoveries in the clause with a two month lag 
in texas  fuel costs are recovered through a fixed fuel factor that may be adjusted two times per year 
in addition  if we materially over recover fuel costs  we must seek to refund the over recovery  and if we materially under recover fuel costs  we may seek a surcharge to recover those costs 
natural gas prices increased significantly in and resulting in a significant increase in deferred fuel revenues particularly in texas due to the lag in reflecting current fuel prices in the fuel recovery mechanism 
the increase in

the increase in deferred fuel revenues for the twelve months ended december  when compared to was million 
in july we filed for an increase in our fixed fuel factor and to surcharge fuel under recoveries with the texas commission 
a settlement approved by the texas commission has allowed us to increase our fixed fuel factor and to surcharge million of fuel under recoveries  including interest as of the end of the under recovery period  over a month period 
in january  we again filed with the texas commission to increase our fixed fuel factor and surcharge approximately million for additional fuel under recoveries  including interest for the period of september through november  over a twelve month period 
we received commission approval to implement the new fuel factor and surcharge on an interim basis beginning with february billings 
fuel revenues recovered from customers increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to and million for the twelve months ended december  compared to these increases are primarily due to the increased fuel costs that are collected from our new mexico customers on a two month lag and the increase in texas fuel factors in october along with an increase in kwh sales for the related period 
fuel revenues also increased for the twelve months ended december  compared to due to the texas fuel disallowance in docket no 
of million that was recorded in with no comparable amount in off system sales 
off system sales are primarily made in off peak periods when we have competitive generation capacity available after meeting our regulated service obligations 
off system sales decreased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to due to a decline in energy available to sell in the off system market because of a decline in output at the palo verde station due to an extended planned refueling and steam generator replacement for unit and unplanned outages at palo verde units and offsetting this decrease in available power were higher average market prices 
off system sales increased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to primarily due to higher average market prices

depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to primarily due to depreciation on new palo verde unit steam generators of million  the implementation of new depreciation rates based on a new depreciation study resulting in an increase of million and increased other depreciable plant balances resulting in an increase of million 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase in the el paso city franchise fees which took effect august   which was partially offset by a decrease in new mexico occupation street rental tax 
as a result of a june change in new mexico law  the occupation street rental tax on retail sales of electricity is now collected directly from retail customers and not recorded as an expense 
taxes other than income taxes were relatively unchanged in compared to other income deductions other income deductions decreased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the loss on extinguishment of debt of million  as a result of the refinancing of our first mortgage bonds in the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by increased interest income in of million primarily related to a million adjustment to reduce interest income associated with the resolution of the texas fuel reconciliation in puc docket no

the decrease was also due to increased capitalized interest of million due to an increase in construction work in progress related to palo verde unit and unit steam generators 
interest charges credits decreased slightly in compared to primarily due to decreased interest expense of million due to a reduction of outstanding debt as a result of open market purchases of our first mortgage bonds  partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest of million as a result of transferring new palo verde unit steam generators to plant in service 
income tax expense income tax expense  before the cumulative effect of an accounting change and an extraordinary item  increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to primarily due to the million benefit from the irs settlement recorded in the third quarter of and for changes in pretax income and certain permanent differences

sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonentary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe sfas no

in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
revised focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
revised requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with some limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period typically the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
sfas no 
revised is effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  sfas no 
revised applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
additionally  compensation cost for outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the effective date shall be expensed as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosure under sfas no

 if applicable  beginning in for the last several years  inflation has been relatively low and  therefore  has had little impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements in the near term are expected to consist of the interest payments on our indebtedness  capital expenditures related to our generating facilities and transmission and distribution systems  operating expenses including fuel costs and taxes 
we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient for such purposes  assuming that we receive timely recognition of recent increases in natural gas costs in fuel rates 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from the balance of million on december  capital requirements 
substantial increases in the cost of natural gas during and the delay in reflecting higher fuel costs in fixed fuel factors in texas have led to the under recovery of the texas jurisdictional portion of our fuel costs by million  including interest  for the period from march to december in november  the texas commission approved a settlement of a fuel factor filing to i surcharge fuel under recoveries including interest through august which then totaled million  ii surcharge the under recovery over a month period  and iii approve new fuel factors which reflected natural gas costs of per mmbtu 
we had previously been permitted to implement the increase in the fuel factor and the fuel surcharge on an interim basis beginning with october billings 
in january  we filed a request with the texas commission for an additional increase in our fixed fuel factors and to surcharge approximately million for fuel under recoveries including interest for the period september to november over a twelve month period 
the requested fuel factor and fuel surcharge were placed into effect on an interim basis subject to refund effective with february bills to customers 
we are currently negotiating with parties on a settlement to resolve this proceeding 
any settlement will be subject to final approval by the texas commission 
until the balance of fuel under recoveries is recovered from customers  we will be required to finance higher natural gas costs from internal sources of cash rather than use such cash for other purposes 
our long term capital requirements consist primarily of construction of electric utility plant and the payment of interest on and refinancing of debt 
utility construction expenditures will consist primarily of expanding and updating the transmission and distribution systems  addition of new generation  and the cost of capital improvements and replacements at palo verde and other generating facilities  including the replacement of steam generators in palo verde unit see part i  item

we expect that all of our construction expenditures will be financed with internal sources of funds through during the twelve months ended december   we generated million of federal income tax loss carryforwards and million of state income tax loss carryforwards as a result of i increased deferred fuel revenues that are not taxable until collected  ii deductible premiums on retired debt  and iii increased deductions due to several method changes primarily related to tax depreciation and repair allowances 
we anticipate that existing federal and state tax loss carryforwards will be fully utilized in and our cash flow requirements for federal and state income taxes are expected to increase over that required in recent years

as of december   approximately million had been drawn for nuclear fuel purchases and no borrowings were outstanding on this facility for working capital needs 
the revolving credit facility was renewed for a five year term in december during the term of the agreement  the revolving credit facility may be increased to million 
given the favorable movements of interest rates in the bank markets and the increased volatility that is being experienced in the natural gas markets  we have recently begun the process of replacing our million revolving credit facility with a new million revolving credit facility
