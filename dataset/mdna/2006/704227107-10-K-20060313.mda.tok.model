market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact its results of operations 
at times  the company reduces its market risk exposures by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
all of the company s derivatives have high correlation with the underlying exposures 
accordingly  changes in fair value of derivatives are expected to be offset by changes in value of the underlying exposures 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes

this exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates that can adversely impact revenues  net income and cash flow

note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and the differences could be material 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and includes freight billed to customers 
in addition  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  revised and updated  the company recognizes revenues from fixed price service contracts on a pro rata basis over the life of the contract  as they are generally performed evenly over the contract period 
revenues derived from other service contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for a reporting period could be adversely affected 
sales returns and allowances management must make estimates of potential future product returns  billing adjustments and allowances related to current period product revenues 
in establishing a provision for sales returns and allowances  management relies principally on the company s history of product return rates as well as customer service billing adjustments and allowances  each of which is regularly analyzed 
management also considers current economic trends  changes in customer demand for the company s products and acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace when evaluating the adequacy of the company s provision for sales returns and allowances 
historically  the company has not experienced a significant change in its product return rates resulting from these factors 
for the years ended december   and  the provision for sales returns and allowances accounted for as a reduction to gross sales  was not material 
allowance for doubtful accounts management makes judgments  based on its established aging policy  historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of the company s accounts receivable  and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is used to reduce gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes customer specific allowances  amounts based upon an aging schedule  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current trends 
the company s accounts receivable balances were  net of allowances of  and  net of allowances of  at december  and  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in process or finished goods 
the value of inventories determined using the last in  first out method was and as of december  and  respectively 
the value of all other inventories  which are determined using the first in  first out method  was and as of december  and  respectively 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates the composition of its inventories and the adequacy of its allowance for slow turning and obsolete products 
market value of aged inventory is determined based on historical sales trends  current market conditions  changes in customer demand  acceptance of the company s products  and current sales activities for this type of inventory 
goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually  using a fair value approach  at the reporting unit level 
in addition  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment if a significant event occurs or circumstances change  which could result in the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeding its fair value 
factors the company considers important  which could indicate impairment  include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
the company assesses the existence of impairment by comparing the implied fair values of its reporting units with their respective carrying amounts  including goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment and  based on the results  the company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed at october   and there have been no indicators of impairment since that date 
a subsequent determination that this goodwill is impaired  however  could have a significant adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews its long lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying values of the assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss is recognized during that period 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between asset carrying values and fair value as determined by prices of similar items and other valuation techniques discounted cash flow analysis  giving consideration to recent operating performance and pricing trends 
asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the company s restructuring initiatives requires management s best estimate of net realizable value 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate the income taxes in each jurisdiction in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not more than likely  the company establishes a valuation allowance 
if a valuation allowance is established or increased during any period  the company records this amount as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recognized against net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are based on management s estimates of the taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries that is considered to be permanently reinvested 
in the event that management changes its consideration on permanently reinvesting the undistributed earnings of its non us subsidiaries  circumstances change in future periods  or there is a change in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company may need to establish an additional income tax provision for the us and other taxes arising from repatriation  which could materially impact its results of operations 
the american jobs creation act of the ajca created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by generally providing an exemption for qualifying dividends received prior to december  during  the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  together with the board of directors  approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by ajca to repatriate in foreign earnings

sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
by eliminating the choice to account for employee stock options under apb opinion no 
and requires companies to recognize the compensation expense resulting from awards of equity instruments to employees  such as stock options and restricted stock  based on the fair value of such awards at date of grant 
under apb the value of restricted stock awards is expensed over the restriction time period and no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants as all such grants have an exercise price not less than market value at date of grant 
for periods through december   the company has disclosed pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by measuring the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes model 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r as of january  using the prospective method which  will result in an incremental expense upon adoption 
the impact on earnings per share in fiscal year of these requirements is currently estimated in the range of to 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in the company s valuation assumptions or changes in market conditions 
due to the timing of the company s equity grants  the charge will not be spread evenly throughout the year 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required  thereby potentially reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
such amounts cannot be estimated for future periods with certainty because they depend largely on when employees will exercise stock options and the market price of the company s stock at the time of exercise
