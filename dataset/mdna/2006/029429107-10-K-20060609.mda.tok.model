there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventories  allowances for obsolete and excess inventory  warrant liability  and income taxes to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition the company derives a portion of its revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost and scope of each contract 
the company s fixed site cargosearch systems are sold under fixed price arrangements 
revenue is recognized using percentage of completion accounting  generally using the company s best estimate of total costs to measure the percent complete with revisions to estimates reflected in the period identified 
the company recognizes certain other cargosearch system sales and other product revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  modified by emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
in those instances where the company enters into agreements involving multiple revenue elements  the agreement is divided into separate elements of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to these elements based on fair value  and revenue recognition is considered separately for each individual element 
the company recognizes field service revenues as services are performed and generally recognizes revenues under maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the contract period which reasonably approximates the period under which the services are rendered 
revenues received in advance of services being rendered are deferred until such services have been provided 
certain of the company s products are covered by a warranty for a one year period 
the company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and management s expectations of future conditions 
to the extent the company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead and are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
excessive manufacturing overhead costs such as idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage attributable to abnormally low volumes levels that materially differ from budgeted production plans due primarily to changes in customer demand are excluded from inventory and recorded as an expense in the period incurred 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand over the next twelve to eighteen months 
demand for products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in inventory balances  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  inventory reserves require estimates of future product demand  which may materially impact the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory were determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
warrant liability in fiscal  the company issued  warrants in connection with a private placement offering of common stock 
as of march    of these warrants remain outstanding 
these warrants can be exchanged for cash under certain circumstances including a merger  sale or tender offer of the company and as such the company recorded the fair value of these warrants as a long term liability on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these warrants is adjusted each period with the resulting gain or loss recorded as other income expense in the statement of operations 
the black scholes method is used to value the warrants and the calculation requires the use of estimates for stock price volatility and interest rates 
the black scholes value of these warrants can fluctuate significantly based on the current fair market value of the company s common stock  changes in interest rates or changes in the volatility of the company s stock price 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  the company recognizes deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at year end based upon its three year cumulative income and its projections of future income  and records a valuation allowance against any net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas r revises sfas no

 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r generally requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires the fair value on the grant date to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
the resulting cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date for sfas r to the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june  the company expects to adopt sfas r on the effective date on a modified prospective basis without restatement of prior period 
as a result of sfas r  the company currently expects that income from continuing operations will decrease by approximately  in this amount represents the net of tax expense for existing stock option awards that will vest during and does not reflect any new awards or modifications to existing awards that could occur in the future 
future stock based compensation will be impacted by additional grants  forfeiture rates and stock price volatility  among other factors 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  inventory costs  which amends part of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 inventory pricing  concerning the treatment of certain types of inventory costs 
the provisions of arb no 
provided that certain inventory related costs  such as double freight and re handling  might be so abnormal that they should be charged against current earnings rather than be included in the cost of inventory 
as amended by sfas no 
 the so abnormal criterion has been eliminated 
thus  all such abnormal costs are required to be treated as current period charges under all circumstances 
in addition  fixed production overhead should be allocated based on the normal capacity of the production facilities  with unallocated overhead charged to expense when incurred 
sfas is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp application of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 
the new act provides for a special tax deduction on qualified production activities income that effectively reduces the company s tax rate 
the fasb has decided that these amounts should be recorded as a special deduction  and recorded in the year earned 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this fsp statement will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

the company s primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
these investments have an average interest rate of approximately and are subject to interest rate risk 
as a result of the average maturity and conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the value of these investments 
in fiscal  the company issued  warrants in connection with a private placement offering of common stock 
as of march    of these warrants remain outstanding 
these warrants can be exchanged for cash under certain circumstances including a merger  sale or tender offer of the company and as such a liability equal to black scholes value of the warrants is recorded on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are recorded as other income expense 
the black scholes value of these warrants can fluctuate significantly based on the current fair market value of the company s common stock 
a change in the fair market value of the company s common stock  holding other assumptions constant  would have approximately a  positive or negative impact on earnings
