item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this annual report on form k 
references contained herein to   and mean the fiscal years ended january   january  and december   respectively 
general as of january   we operated high end  high volume restaurants in the united states 
in addition  we own a smith wollensky unit in new orleans  louisiana s w of new orleans  which was closed on august  due to hurricane katrina 
at this time  we are unable to determine when this restaurant will reopen and are evaluating our options 
we also own our new concept  quality meats  a contemporary american restaurant that is located in the space previously occupied by the manhattan ocean club  which closed on january   and is scheduled to open in the second quarter of although we do not have any leases signed other than leases relating to our existing locations  we plan to resume our growth in with the launch of our first free standing grill 
we plan to open a total of three to four grills from to the menus and atmosphere of the grills will be updated from the original wollensky s grill  which opened in  adjacent to the flagship smith wollensky location in new york city 
although the growth focus will be on opening grills  we will continue to look at opportunities to open smith wollensky units 
our cash investment for each of our owned smith wollensky restaurants open as of january   net of landlord contributions  averaged approximately million  excluding pre opening costs and our smith wollensky restaurants averaged approximately  square feet 
when we resume our growth in  we expect that each free standing grill restaurant will range between  and  square feet and will require a cash investment of approximately million  net of landlord contributions and excluding pre opening expenses 
the estimate of the amount of our cash investment assumes that the property on which each new unit is located is being leased and is dependent on the size of the location and the amount of the landlord contribution 
as a result of our recent expansion and when our locations opened  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new restaurant opens  we typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs as a percentage of sales during the first year of its operation 
average sales for our thirteen consolidated units open for all of were million per restaurant 
in calculating comparable consolidated restaurant sales  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable consolidated restaurant base once it has been in operation for months 
comparable consolidated restaurant sales do not include the sales for the smith wollensky in new orleans which was closed on august  due to hurricane katrina 
at this time  we are unable to determine when the restaurant will reopen and are currently evaluating our options 
pursuant to management contracts and arrangements  we operate  but do not own  the original smith wollensky  maloney porcelli  and the post house restaurants in new york 
consolidated restaurant sales include gross sales less sales taxes and other discounts 
cost of consolidated restaurant sales include food and beverage costs  salaries and related benefits  restaurant operating expenses  occupancy and related expenses  marketing and promotional expenses and restaurant level depreciation and amortization 
salaries and related benefits include components of restaurant labor  including direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  fringe benefits and related payroll taxes 
restaurant operating expenses include operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs and other operating expenses 
occupancy and related expenses include rent  real estate taxes and other occupancy costs 
management fee income relates to fees that we receive from our managed units 
these fees are based on a percentage of sales from the managed units  ranging from to 
prior to december  we operated park avenue caf in chicago  mrs 
park s tavern and the other services of the food and beverage department of doubletree pursuant to the doubletree agreement 
we received a management fee equal to the sum of of sales and a percentage of earnings  as defined 
the doubletree agreement was to expire on the earlier of december  or the termination of the related hotel management agreement between hsr  the owner of the doubletree and doubletree partners  the manager of the doubletree 
during december  hsr closed the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago and discontinued our requirement to provide other food and beverage department service for the doubletree 
as a result  we no longer receive the fees described above 
during the three month period ended march   we reached an agreement with hsr 
the agreement provides for the continued use by hsr of the name mrs 
parks tavern and required us to provide management services to support that location 
in exchange for the use of the mrs 
park s tavern name and related management support the company received an annual fee of  during  we agreed to reduce the annual fee to  for the continued use by hsr of the name mrs 
parks tavern  but no longer provide management services to support the location 
management fee income also included fees received from onecps on december   we amended the agreement with plaza operating partners 
effective january   plaza operating partners agreed to pay us  per quarter as a minimum base management fee 
the minimum base management fee was credited against any management fee that we earned under the agreement 
this amendment also gave either party the right to fund or refuse to fund any necessary working capital requirements 
if neither party was willing to fund the required additional working capital contributions  as defined  then either party could have terminated the agreement 
plaza operating partners agreed to fund until october   the date that we were notified by plaza operating partners that it had sold the plaza hotel  the property in which the restaurant was located  and the date plaza operating partners directed us to advise the employees of onecps of the closing 
we funded the cash requirements of onecps until january   the date on which we were required to close the restaurant at the direction of the new owner 
on november   we informed certain of our employees that onecps would close effective january  as a result  we are no longer accruing additional quarterly management fees under our agreement with plaza operating partners with respect to any periods following january  general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing owned and managed operations and provide infrastructure to our organization 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel costs  information systems  training costs  corporate rent  corporate insurance and professional and consulting fees 
pre opening costs incurred in connection with the opening of new restaurants are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses also include the depreciation of corporate level property and equipment and the amortization of corporate intangible assets  such as licensing agreements and management contracts 
royalty expense represents fees paid pursuant to a licensing agreement with st 
james associates  based upon of sales  as defined  for restaurants utilizing the smith wollensky name 
on january   we the licensee  signed an amended and restated sale and license agreement  dated as of january  the amended licensing agreement  with st 
james associates  lp the licensor which provides for  among other things  a reduced licensing fee only for the opening of grills that are less than  square feet 
pursuant to the amended licensing agreement  the one time opening fee paid to the licensor for each new additional grill grill opening fee will be at a rate equal to of the fee due under the original licensing agreement 
in addition  the annual royalty fee grill royalty fee will be reduced from to for annual sales from grills 
both the grill opening fee and grill royalty fee are subject to maximum average per person checks that  if exceeded  could increase both the grill opening fee and grill royalty fee  but not to exceed the opening fee and royalty fee contained in the original licensing agreement 
the terms of the amendment do not apply to the existing wollensky s grills

the preparation of these financial statements require us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  gift certificate liability  lease accounting  income tax valuation allowances and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that can not readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
sales from consolidated restaurants are recognized as revenue at the point of the delivery of meals and services 
sales for branded merchandise are recognized as revenue at the point the orders are fulfilled 
management fee income is recognized as the related management fee is earned pursuant to the respective agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from credit card processing companies or individuals that have good historical track records of payment 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  from  in to  in the net decrease in the allowance was determined by conducting a specific review of major account balances and by applying statistical experience factors to the various aging categories of receivable balances 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the actual payment history of each individual customer  as well as considering changes that occur in the financial condition or the local economy of a particular customer that could affect our bad debt expenses and allowance for doubtful accounts 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through future undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by restaurant comparing the carrying amount of the restaurant s assets to undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by such assets 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit  its individual results and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of fair value of reporting units acquired in the formation of the company over the book value of those reporting units identifiable net assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we had originally determined that certain of our restaurants with assigned goodwill were separate reporting units 
as a result of the consensus reached in september by the emerging issues task force eitf in regard to determining whether to aggregate operating segments of an enterprise  we concluded that the entities that were previously viewed as separate reporting entities could now be viewed as one single reporting entity for purposes of assessing goodwill 
as such  we compared the fair value of the single reporting entity to the total equity carrying value to determine if impairment exists 
the fair value is calculated using various methods  including an analysis based on projected discounted future operating cash flows of the single reporting entity using a discount rate reflecting our weighted average cost of capital 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the single reporting entity 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
prior to  we had recorded an impairment of goodwill of  during related to our mrs 
parks management company reporting unit 
this impairment related to lower than anticipated future cash flow for us from the closing by the hotel owner of the park avenue caf restaurant in chicago 
for  the fair value of the single reporting entity is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the carrying value of goodwill as of january  and january  was million 
other intangible assets 
we review other intangible assets  which include costs attributable to a sale and licensing agreement and the cost of the acquisition of management contracts  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of our intangible assets will be assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected net cash flows to be generated by such assets 
an intangible asset would be considered impaired if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of the assets generating those cash flows 
we limit assumptions about such factors as sales and margin improvements to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized will be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value would be calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the assessment of the recoverability of these intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are negatively modified by us as a result of changes in economic conditions  significant events that occur or other factors arising after the preparation of any previous analysis 
for our other intangible assets  the fair value is in excess of the recorded carrying value 
the net carrying value of these intangible assets as of january  and january  was million and million  respectively 
artwork 
we purchase artwork and antiques for display in our restaurants 
we do not depreciate artwork and antiques since these assets have cultural  aesthetic or historical value that is worth preserving perpetually and we have the ability and intent to protect and preserve these assets 
such assets are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the net carrying value of our artwork as of both january  and january  was million 
self insurance liability 
we are self insured for our employee health program 
we maintain stop loss insurance to limit our total exposure and individual claims 
the liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical medical claim patterns and known economic conditions 
if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
however  we believe that a change in our current accrual requirement of or less would cause a change of approximately  or less  to our financial results 
gift certificate liability 
we record a gift certificate liability for gift certificates sold to customers to be redeemed at a future date 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized when the gift certificates are redeemed 
in april  a new gift card tracking system was implemented to track the gift card liability 
for gift cards issued prior to april  we used our best estimate to establish a liability for gift certificates issued  but not redeemed prior to april old gift certificates 
based on the redemption of old gift certificates during the year ended january   a change in estimate was deemed necessary 
the impact of this change was related to promotional gift cards and was to increase marketing and promotional expense therefore increasing our net loss by during the year ended january  lease accounting 
we use the lease term plus any renewal period in determining the life of a lease 
the renewal period is included in the life because we base our original willingness to invest in a new location on our plan to maximize our return on investment over the entire period available which includes the renewal period 
we only select locations where we can obtain long term leases  including renewal options 
if we gain access to the premise prior to the commencement of the lease  then this additional period is added to the original lease term 
we amortize certain costs associated with the lease over the life of the lease plus the renewal period 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the amortization of leasehold improvements and the amortization of deferred rent liability 
we include tenant allowances received by us from the landlord as an increase to our deferred rent liability 
the amortization period for deferred rent is over the life of the accounting lease  which includes  the date from which we obtain control over the premises to the ending date of the legal lease document  which includes the renewal period 
any rent or deferred rent expense incurred during the construction period was capitalized as a part of leasehold improvements and is being amortized on a straight line basis from the date operations commence over the remaining life of the lease  which includes the renewal period 
starting with new leases entered into after september   we began expensing these costs in conjunction with the proposed fasb staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
fin r 
fin r addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
all variable interest entities  regardless of when created  were required to be evaluated under fin r no later than the first period ending after march  an entity shall be subject to consolidation according to the provisions of this interpretation if  by design  as a group the holders of the equity investment at risk lack any one of the following three characteristics of a controlling financial interest the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
we perform a detailed analysis of all of our management arrangements to determine if any of the equity investments lack one of the above characteristics 
we consolidated the accounts and results of the entity that owns maloney porcelli for the fiscal years ended january  and january  because the holders of the equity investment lacked one of the above characteristics 
legal proceedings 
we are involved in various claims and legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is not remote and can be reasonably estimated  a liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and income tax valuation allowances 
we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes and estimates related to the ultimate realization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
at january   we had a deferred tax asset of million  which was fully reserved and included net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million that was reversed during the three months ended july  and was utilized against the tax gain associated with the sale of the las vegas property on may  in addition  a deferred tax asset of approximately million was recorded during the three months ended july  for the temporary difference on the deferred gain relating to the sale of the las vegas property 
as of january   we have a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset of million  due to the uncertainty of this benefit being realized in the future 
these tax credit carryforwards exist in federal and certain state jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income for federal and state purposes and our resulting ability to utilize tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events and operating results 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes

the increase in salaries and related benefits is also attributable to the payroll and related benefits associated with the increase in comparable unit sales  an increase in the cost of health insurance provided to employees and paid for in part by us and increases in employer contributions for other payroll taxes

see notes to consolidated financial statements  notes and liquidity we believe that our cash  short term and long term investments on hand  projected cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit agreement should be sufficient to finance our redesign of the location where the manhattan ocean club was located for a new concept  quality meats  and maintenance capital expenditures in respect of existing units and operations throughout  as well as allow us to meet our debt service obligations under our loan agreements  including our approximately million outstanding on our promissory note with hibernia  and begin our planned expansion 
our cash resources  and therefore our liquidity  are dependent upon the level of internally generated cash from operations 
changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events could cause us to seek alternative financing or reschedule our maintenance capital expenditure and expansion plans 
while we would seek to obtain additional funds through commercial borrowings or the private or public issuance of debt or equity securities  there can be no assurance that such funds would be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us

seasonality our business is seasonal in nature depending on the region of the united states in which a particular restaurant is located  with revenues generally being less in the third quarter than in other quarters due to reduced summer volume and highest in the fourth quarter due to year end and holiday events 
as we continue to expand in other locations  the seasonality pattern may change 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease and labor costs 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
effect of new accounting standards effective october   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb concluded in this fsp that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be expensed 
fasb technical bulletin ftb no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires that rental costs associated with operating leases be allocated on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and ftb  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  starting with the beginning of the lease term 
the fasb believes there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during the construction period and the right to use that asset after the construction period 
as concluded  companies are required to apply the guidance for new leases entered into from this point on 
we had a policy of capitalizing rent during the construction period and have changed that policy going forward 
we do not believe that the adoption of this fsp will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application of the new accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used 
in addition  this statement requires that a change in depreciation method be accounted for as a change in estimate 
the requirements are effective for changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 and generally requires the cost associated with employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments be measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognized in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r also provides guidance on how to determine the grant date fair value for awards of equity instruments as well as alternative methods of adopting its requirements 
sfas no 
r is effective for the beginning of the first annual reporting period after june  and applies to all outstanding and unvested share based payment awards at a company s adoption date 
we believe the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial statements will be comparable to the proforma disclosure
