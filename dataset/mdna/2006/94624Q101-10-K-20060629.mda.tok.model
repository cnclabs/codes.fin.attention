item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the consolidated financial statements include wayne savings bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  wayne savings community bank 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net earnings are primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net earnings also are affected by its provision for losses on loans  as well as the amount of other income  including trust fees and service charges  and general  administrative and other expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including the establishment of a trust department  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding assets to the company s loan portfolio 
discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march  in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
a detailed discussion as to the application of such policy is set forth on the following pages 
at march   total assets of million remained virtually unchanged from the million total at march  liquid assets  consisting of cash  interest bearing deposits and investment securities  decreased by million  or  to million at march  mainly due to a reduction in federal funds sold of million 
mortgage backed securities decreased by million  or  to million as these adjustable rate securities continued to experience significant principal repayments due to borrowers refinancing to fixed rate loans in the current rising interest rate environment 
principal repayments were partially offset by purchases of mortgage backed securities totaling million 
during the fiscal year ended march   loans receivable increased million  or  as the bank originated and retained million of loans and received payments of million 
rather than reinvest funds from sales of and repayments on loans in long term  fixed rate and lower yielding residential loans during this period of rising interest rates  the lending division has been able to originate shorter term adjustable rate commercial loans 
the company believes that investing in shorter term and adjustable rate commercial loans positions the company favorably in the current interest rate environment 
the composition of the loan portfolio continued to evolve during the fiscal year ending march   as exemplified by a net decrease of million in residential and construction mortgage loans  which were more than offset by increases in nonresidential real estate loans of million and a net increase in commercial loans of million 
at march   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or 
of loans  compared to million  or 
of loans at march  in determining the amount of loan loss analysis at any point of time  management and the board apply a systematic process of focusing on the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were viewed as well secured  with no material loss anticipated 
the second step in determining the allowance for loan loss entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the board s and management s perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
due primarily to the growth of the nonresidential real estate and the commercial loan portfolio  management charged  to the provision during fiscal discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march  continued deposits at march   totaled million  an increase of million from million at march   generally reflecting the bank s competitive deposit pricing in all market areas 
certificates of deposit increased by million  newly implemented commercial repurchase agreements increased by million  now accounts increased by million and money market investor accounts increased by million 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in savings deposits 
borrowings totaled million at march  as compared with million at march  the company was able to repay short term federal home loan bank advances during the fiscal year by utilizing the increase in deposits and cash flows from the loan and securities portfolios 
stockholders equity totaled million  a decrease of million  or  during the year ending march   due primarily to purchases of treasury stock totaling million  dividends totaling million and an increase in the unrealized loss on available for sale securities of  these amounts were partially offset by million in net earnings for the fiscal year ended march  and from stock option exercises totaling comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general the company has continued to maintain its strategy to aggressively manage interest rate risk 
this strategy negatively affected earnings for fiscal and  with earnings benefits beginning to appear the last half of fiscal management believes that the investment of excess funds primarily in shorter term assets will continue to help the company in the current rising interest rate environment 
net earnings totaled million for fiscal year ended march   an increase of million when compared to the net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net earnings was primarily attributable to an increase net interest income of  a decrease in provision for loan losses of  and a decrease in general  administrative and other expense of  or 
the growth in pretax earnings was partially offset by an increase in federal income taxes of  interest income interest income increased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to the same period in this increase was mainly due to an increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets to from for the fiscal year ended march   coupled with an increase in the weighted average balance of million  or 
the yield increase is primarily due to the federal reserve raising the federal funds rate over the past year 
these rate increases have beneficially affected the yields earned on the company s investment securities and interest bearing deposits 
the company has purposefully invested excess funds in shorter term securities and adjustable rate loans rather than long term fixed rate loans 
although such strategy can sacrifice short term income  it strengthens the company s interest rate position and allows the company to profitably redeploy such assets in a rising rate environment 
interest income on loans increased million  or  for the year ended march   compared to the same period in  due primarily to a million  or  increase in the weighted average balance of loans year over year  coupled with a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding 
the increase in the weighted average balance of loans was primarily due to the emphasis on nonresidential and commercial loans 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued interest income continued interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased  or  during fiscal  compared to the same period in  due primarily to a decrease of million  or  in the weighted average balance caused mainly by continued principal prepayments 
the decrease in the weighted average balance was offset by an increase of basis points to a weighted average yield of as compared to  from the comparable period  generally reflecting upward interest rate adjustments in the current rising rate environment 
interest income on investment securities increased by million  or during the period compared to the same period in  reflecting an increase in the weighted average balance of million  or  to million from million during the comparable period  coupled with an increase in the average yield of basis points to 
the increase in the weighted average volume reflects the company s strategy of investing in short term investment securities in the current increasing interest rate environment 
this strategy provides the company with flexibility to use funds from securities sales and repayments to originate loans such as nonresidential and commercial loans with higher yields and in some instances shorter terms 
interest income on interest bearing deposits increased by  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to an increase in the average yield of basis points to  partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average balance during fiscal of million  or 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from interest expense for fiscal year ended march  the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average cost of funds of basis points to for fiscal  coupled with an increase of million  or  in the weighted average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding in fiscal interest expense on deposits totaled million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in deposit costs resulted from an increase of basis points in the average cost of deposits to for fiscal  coupled with a increase in the average balance outstanding of million  or 
as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from lower cost savings deposits to higher cost certificates of deposits contributed to the increase in the cost of deposits 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended march   an increase of  or  from the period  due primarily to an increase in the weighted average balance of million  or  which was partially offset by rate reduction of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the repayment of higher rate advances 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  or  from the amount for fiscal the average interest rate spread increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the net interest margin increased to for fiscal from for the fiscal year ended march  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
to the best of management s knowledge  all known and inherent losses that are probable and which can be reasonably estimated have been recorded as of march other income other income  consisting primarily of an increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  gains on sale of loans  service fees  and charges on deposit accounts increased by  or  to million for fiscal  from million for the year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash surrender value of life insurance of  and  in other service fees  charges and other operating income  partially offset by a reduction of  in gain on sale of loans 
the decline in gain on sale of loans is primarily due to a significant reduction in origination volume  amplified by management s decision during fiscal to retain certain fixed rate mortgage loans to facilitate growth in the portfolio 
general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense decreased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal the decrease in general  administrative and other expense is primarily due to the absence of the million in accelerated expense related to the management recognition and stock option plan recognized in employee compensation and benefits decreased by  or 
net of the aforementioned accelerated expense of the management recognition and stock option plan  employee compensation and benefits increased  due primarily to  in retirement expense recognized due to the death of the former chief executive officer and retirement of the chief operations officer and normal merit salary increases 
an increase of  or  in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to increased data line costs related to the online banking program  coupled with an increase of depreciation expense 
a decrease of  or  in franchise taxes was due to the reduction in equity from the repurchase of treasury stock 
the increase in other operating expense was primarily attributable to increased professional costs related to routine compliance matters  the new online banking program  and additional service charges related to the trust department 
federal income taxes the federal income tax expense was  for the year ended march   reflecting an increase of  in federal income tax expense from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in pre tax earnings 
the difference in the effective tax rate or rate of benefits from the statutory rate is mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general fiscal was a year of strategic transition for the company 
the company s primary competitor was acquired by a major regional bank holding company  positioning wayne savings as the largest independent community bank in the five county market areas 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued general continued management had long perceived the market area preference for local ownership and decision making 
in recognition of this fact  management believed that the company had a unique opportunity to expand its product lines  particularly in the areas of commercial lending and trust services 
management also recognized that expansion of such product lines would initially place pressures on the company s operating costs 
as a result  management undertook a review of the company s ability to expand its product lines in view of its current cost structure 
such review culminated in the conclusion that several of its benefit plans  specifically the previous grants under the management recognition plan and the stock ownership plan reflected compensation awards which were more closely aligned with past versus future managerial performance 
moreover  in view of the mandatory expensing of stock options pursuant to sfas no 
r  management concluded that the approximate  in annual pre tax savings resulting from accelerating the expense of the stock option plan was a prudent method of expanding the company s product lines without placing undue pressure on the company s future cost structure 
due in large part to these decisions  net earnings totaled  for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of million  or  below the net earnings of million for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in net earnings was primarily attributable to an increase in general  administrative and other expense of million  or  an increase in the provision for losses on loans of  or  a decrease in other income of  or  and a decrease in net interest income of  or 
these earnings reductions were partially offset by a decrease in federal income tax expense of million 
interest income interest income for the fiscal year ended march   decreased  or  to million 
this decrease was the result of a basis point reduction in the yield earned on interest earning assets to  partially offset by an increase in the weighted average balance of interest earning assets totaling million  or  to million for the year ended march  interest income on loans declined million  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average balance of loans outstanding of million  or  compared to the fiscal  coupled with a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on loans to for fiscal interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased  during fiscal  due primarily to a million  or  decrease in the weighted average balance outstanding from the period  which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield of basis points to 
interest income on investments increased by  or  reflecting an increase in the weighted average balance of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average yield of basis points to from during fiscal interest income on interest bearing deposits and other increased by  or  reflecting an increase in the weighted average balance of million  or  coupled with an increase in the weighted average yield of basis points to from during fiscal comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued interest income continued the decrease in the average balance of loans and mortgage backed securities as well as the increase in the average balance of investments and interest bearing deposits is consistent with the company s aforementioned strategy to shorten the average maturity of the company s interest earning assets 
the company has invested a significant portion of the funds from payments on loans and mortgage backed securities in short term investment securities and other short term investment vehicles 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal totaled million  a decrease of  or  from interest expense of million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease resulted from a basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to for fiscal  offset by an increase in the average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding of million  or  to million for fiscal interest expense on deposits totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal  as a result of an basis point decrease in the average cost of deposits to for the period offset by an increase in the average balance outstanding of million  or  to million for fiscal interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  from fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in the average balance of borrowings of million to an average balance of million for fiscal from million for the year ended march   coupled with a decrease in the average cost of borrowings to from an average cost of for fiscal net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  or  from fiscal the average interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended march  from for fiscal the net interest margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
as a result of the increased commercial loan volume  the acquisition of stebbins loan portfolio and an enhancement of the company s loan rating standards  management increased the provision for loan losses by  in fiscal to the best of management s knowledge  all known and inherent losses that are probable and which can be reasonably estimated were recorded at march  other income other income  consisting primarily of an increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  gains on sale of loans  service fees  and charges on deposit accounts  decreased by  or  to million for fiscal  from million for the year ended march  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease of  in merchant fee income due to a significant reduction in volume 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  approximately million of this increase resulted from management s decision to accelerate the vesting and attendant expense of the management recognition and stock option plans 
the increase in employee compensation and benefits of million  or  was primarily attributable to the acceleration of benefit plan costs  normal merit increases and additional staff needed for operating in a heavily regulated industry 
an increase of  or  in occupancy and equipment expense was primarily due to a data conversion and operations costs related to the stebbins acquisition 
an increase of  or  in franchise taxes was due to the increase in equity from the fiscal conversion to stock form 
similarly  the increase in other operating expense was primarily attributable to increased costs related to the stebbins acquisition 
federal income taxes the federal income tax benefit was  for the year ended march   reflecting a decrease of million in federal income tax expense from fiscal the reduction resulted primarily from a million  or  decrease in pre tax earnings 
the difference in the effective tax rate or rate of benefits from the statutory rate is mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations

while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
federal funds sold and other liquid assets outstanding at march   and  amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from the company s operating  financing and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of their operating  investing and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash are net earnings  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb  and sales of mortgage backed securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate funds internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank  which provide an additional source of funds 
at march   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb 
at march   management believes the company has additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaling million

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of their effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 
presented below  as of march  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a and basis point decrease in market interest rates 
due to the current interest rate environment  the changes in npv are not estimated for a decrease of basis points 
asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis continued as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   bp  as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   the company s policy in recent years had been to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and by originating adjustable rate mortgage arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments and mortgage backed securities 
however  particularly in the rising short term interest rate environment which currently exists  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended march  the company has sought to lengthen the maturities of its deposits by promoting longer term certificates  however  the company was not successful in lengthening the maturities of its deposits in the interest rate environment that existed throughout fiscal the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed asset liability risk ranges for each of the last three years
