this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
see note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat life threatening diseases  primarily cancer  and viral and other infectious diseases 
our lead product zadaxin is approved for sale in select markets internationally  most notably in china where we have an established sales and marketing operation 
our strategy is to leverage our advantage in china by in licensing or acquiring the marketing rights to other products to market in this rapidly growing pharmaceutical market 
zadaxin is currently being evaluated in a large  phase stage iv malignant melanoma clinical trial in europe 
in addition  a large phase clinical trial is ongoing in europe using zadaxin as part of a novel triple therapy combination for the treatment of hcv 
in december  we reported results from the first of our two us phase trials evaluating the double therapy combination of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha to treat hcv patients who had failed previous therapy 
the results from this trial did not demonstrate that zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon alpha provides a statistically significant clinical benefit when compared with pegylated interferon alpha alone 
although not statistically significant  a positive zadaxin treatment related trend was observed 
data from the second us hcv trial is expected to be reported in june during the periods encompassed by this annual report on form k  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our zadaxin clinical trials and our zadaxin commercialization activities 
our primary focus has been the clinical development of zadaxin as a part of a new combination therapy for the treatment of hcv 
we manufacture zadaxin for sale  and for our clinical trials  through third party contract manufacturers  and we conduct our research and development efforts principally through arrangements with clinical research sites  contract research organizations and universities 
from commencement of operations through december   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately  at least over the next few years  we expect net losses to continue at similar levels or to increase due to increased operating expenses as we expand our research and development  clinical testing and sales and marketing capabilities 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability is primarily dependent on the execution and successful completion of zadaxin clinical trials and securing regulatory approvals for zadaxin in the major pharmaceutical markets of the united states  europe  and japan  and  if approved in those countries  the successful commercialization and marketing of zadaxin 
in addition  other factors may also impact our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability  including the pricing of zadaxin and its manufacturing and marketing costs  our ability to compete in pharmaceutical markets  the cost of long term product development and commercialization programs  the timing and costs of acquiring rights to additional drugs  our ability to fund our operations and the entrance into and extension of agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate 
we expect net sales to increase in due to increase sales to china 
primarily due to the level of research and development activities and other operations  we expect a net loss and a reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  the number  timing  costs and results of preclinical and clinical trials of our 
table of contents products  market acceptance of zadaxin and the timing of orders for zadaxin from international markets  particularly china  the regulatory approval process  the timing of fda or international regulatory approvals  and the acquisition of additional product rights and the funding  if any  provided as a result of corporate partnering arrangements 
critical accounting policies general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them  and they do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we will replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
we exercise judgment in estimating return reserves 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
we exercise judgment in determining the period over which our performance obligations have been fulfilled which can have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue that is recognized in a particular reporting period 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue associated with substantive performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements and provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii there are no future performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
we exercise judgment in our determination of the achievement of milestones which can have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a particular reporting period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
we maintain reserves for credit losses  and such losses have been within our expectations 
we recognize reserves for bad debts ranging from to 
table of contents of past due accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our collectibility experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including  but not limited to  an analysis of the historical payment patterns of our customers  individual customer circumstances and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would increase our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net loss 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than expected  this would decrease our general and administrative expenses and decrease our reported net loss 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or realizable market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations 
impairment of intangible assets at december   we had net intangible assets of  related to zadaxin product rights and have never recorded any impairment losses related to intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses are principally incurred for our clinical trials including our phase clinical trials in the united states 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous institutions that conduct the clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
expenses related to grants to the institutions are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
in general  for the phase clinical trials in the united states  these expenses are higher for the initial and final months of a patient s scheduled months of treatment and observation 
expenses relating to the clinical research organizations or other entities managing the trials and laboratory and other direct expenses are recognized in the period they are estimated to be incurred and the services performed 
we monitor active patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates accordingly  however  if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could underestimate our actual research and development expenses  requiring the recording of additional expenses and an increase in net loss in the future 
stock option valuation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee and director 
table of contents stock options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility 
changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our stock options as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in order to estimate the value of stock options  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility  and expected term of the award 
we utilized historical information available to support our estimate of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
we believe that it is appropriate to place greater weight on historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
we believe that historical realized volatilities of options with appropriate terms are a strong indicator of future volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises  and the expected volatility 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
results of operations product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and all were derived from sales of zadaxin 
sales to customers in china accounted for approximately  and of this revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
product prices have remained stable throughout the  and periods 
approximately  of the sales in were from an unanticipated temporary increase in demand for zadaxin from hospitals in china at the time of the sars outbreak during the second quarter of for the years ended december   and  sales to between three and five importing agents in china accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our product sales 
in  guang dong south pharmaceutical foreign trade co  ltd  zhuhai goldsn medicine co  ltd and china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation accounted for   and of our sales  respectively 
in  china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation  china meheco corporation and guang dong south pharmaceutical foreign trade co  ltd accounted for  and of our sales  respectively 
in  china national pharmaceutical foreign trade corporation and china meheco corporation accounted for and of sales  respectively 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in those periods 
as of december   approximately  or  of our accounts receivable were attributable to three customers in china 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and generally do not require collateral from our customers 
contract revenue was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the contract revenue for includes a  milestone payment we received from sigma tau relating to the completion of enrollment of our us phase hcv clinical trials 
the remaining contract revenue recognized in  and is in connection with the  payment we received from sigma tau in january this revenue is recognized as contract revenue over the course of the zadaxin us phase hcv clinical trials and the period of sharing the clinical data from these trials with sigma tau in accordance with the requirements under our contract 

table of contents gross margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin percentage in the period was primarily the result of lower product costs for product sold in that period 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in the period was primarily the result of higher product costs in connection with the transfer to a new toll manufacturer for zadaxin and lower product costs in the periods due to higher volume productions in response to the sars epidemic in china 
we expect cost of product sales and hence gross margin to vary from year to year  depending upon the level of zadaxin sales  the absorption of product related fixed costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory 
research and development r d expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease over the years from to was primarily related to the us phase hcv clinical trials nearing completion at the end of during  we recorded approximately  of expenses related to the us phase hcv trial 
this compares to expenses in of approximately  and approximately  in in  and  r d expenses represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total costs and expenses 
the major components of r d expenses consist of clinical studies performed by clinical trial institutions and contract research organizations  related materials and supplies  preclinical work  pharmaceutical development  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  third party research funding  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs primarily relate to clinical trials 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
during  we recorded approximately  of research   of clinical development  and  of pharmaceutical development activities 
this compares to expenses in of approximately  of research   of clinical development  and  of pharmaceutical development activities and expenses in of approximately  of research   of clinical development  and  of pharmaceutical development activities 
the initiation and continuation of our current clinical development programs has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
in general  we expect research and development expenses to vary substantially from quarter to quarter as we pursue our strategy of initiating additional preclinical and clinical trials and testing  acquiring product rights  and expanding regulatory activities 
an expansion or significant extension of our clinical development programs may require us to seek additional capital resources 
sales and marketing expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year to year increases from to were related to expenses for advertising and conferences associated with the expansion of our marketing efforts for zadaxin 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased expenses related to conferences of  and increased expenses associated with the expansion of our marketing efforts of approximately  the increase in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased expenses related to conferences of approximately  we expect sales and marketing expenses for to be higher than those incurred in due to increased sales efforts 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily related to increased legal fees of approximately  to support increased legal and regulatory activities  increased accounting fees of approximately  associated with increased securities regulation requirements and approximately  related to non cash stock price performance based option expenses 
the increase in was primarily attributable to a non recurring expense of  incurred in connection with the separation of our former chief executive officer from the company in july  increased accounting fees of approximately  
table of contents associated with increased regulatory requirements and an increase in legal fees of approximately  in the near term  we expect increased general and administrative expenses as we increase our general and administrative activities to support increased expenditures on business development  legal and regulatory activities 
interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and investment income in included a gain from the sale of equity securities in the amount of approximately  excluding this gain in  the increase in interest and investment income in is primarily due to cash balances earning higher interest rates in the periods 
interest and investment expense relating to  of convertible notes payable was   and  for each of the years ended december   and net loss for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
net loss was lower in than in principally due to higher net sales and gross margin and lower operating expenses 
net loss per share for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
weighted average shares outstanding for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire in the years through the difference between the cumulative losses for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes is primarily attributable to losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources at december   and  we had   and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in each of these years  the principal factors affecting these balances were the net loss and cash provided by financing activities 
we currently estimate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  will be lower than the balance at december  the expected decrease in this balance is primarily attributable to further expected net loss 
the short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid marketable securities 
we have two letters of credit each secured by a certificate of deposit 
at december   the letters of credit totaled  one for  under our lease agreement  the other for  to facilitate our value added tax filings in europe 
net cash used in operating activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to the net loss of  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was less than the net loss primarily due to a  decrease in inventory levels 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was more than the net loss primarily due to a  increase in inventory levels to provide an uninterrupted supply of zadaxin as we transferred production to a new contract manufacturer 
net cash used by us in investing activities amounted to  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities in the amount of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the increase in is primarily due to the purchase of us treasury securities in the amount of  in 
table of contents net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in the amount of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of the repayment of a  convertible note partially offset by proceeds received of approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee and director stock option plans and  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee and director stock option plans and  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  from a public offering of common stock  approximately  from the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock by institutional and accredited investors  approximately  from the issuance of common stock to sigma tau  approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee and director stock option plans and  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years more than years convertible note payable operating leases purchase obligations royalty obligations total the convertible note matures in march see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
included in the amounts above is  for interest payments 
these are future minimum rental commitments for office space and copiers leased under non cancelable operating lease arrangements 
this includes approximately  in minimum purchase requirements from a contract manufacturer  approximately  in research and development fees payable to the contract research organization under our agreement for the us phase hcv clinical trials  and approximately  payable to our european marketing and development partner  sigma tau  to conduct and complete an hcv clinical trial in europe 
this includes  per year through in minimum royalty payments to the us army and  of non cancelable prepaid royalties to be paid to wayne state university 
additionally upon regulatory approval of zadaxin and commercialization of the product in certain countries  the company is obligated to pay the us army and wayne state university a royalty based on a percentage of zadaxin sales 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our existing capital resources and funds from product sales are sufficient to finance our operations for the immediate future but are not sufficient to complete our current plans to conduct and complete clinical trials with scv and zadaxin  and  if we proceed with all the development efforts we are planning  we would need to raise additional financing 
the unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which would severely hurt our business 
we cannot assure you that funds from financings will be sufficient to complete our current plans to conduct and complete clinical trials 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon 
table of contents numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties  the status of competitive products  and the condition of the capital markets and the availability of financing for sciclone in particular 
there are no officers or directors that were involved in related party transactions in off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements in  or recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which revises sfas  and supersedes apb  and its related implementation guidance 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee or director provides service in exchange for the award 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective basis on january  and anticipate compensation expense for the twelve months ended december  to be approximately  however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  the number of stock based awards our board of directors may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees and directors using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee and director stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our cash or overall financial position 
however  had we adopted sfas r using the black scholes option pricing model in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in the accounting for stock based compensation section of note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our cash solely in us treasury or us government agency notes and highly rated  highly liquid short term municipal securities 
our investments in these notes are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term notes and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value of our available for sale securities 
this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
substantially all our sales and most of our manufacturing costs to date have been in us dollars 
however  our purchases from one of our contract manufacturers are denominated in euros and costs of our marketing efforts in china are paid in local currency 
this exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
losses related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have been insignificant to date
