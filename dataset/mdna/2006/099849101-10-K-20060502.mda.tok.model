item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
as of december   we had on hand sales orders that would have been recognized as period revenue  had those orders been shipped  totaling approximately million of product licenses 
our marketing and lead generation activities are designed to support the above sales strategy  to drive awareness and create and foster sales leads for the previously mentioned solutions  products and services  as well as to increase visibility of the borland brand and our vision for software delivery optimization 
research and development we believe that innovation  timeliness of product releases and high product quality are essential to maintain a competitive position 
consequently  we dedicate considerable resources to development efforts to enhance existing products and to develop new products 
the product development group is responsible for the design  development and release of product enhancements  upgrades and new products 
current research and development efforts are directed at enhancing our current technology and products  especially alm products 
we devote a significant percentage of our operating expenses to research and development efforts 
research and development expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively  representing  and of our net total revenues in those years 
rapid technological advances in software development  evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete 
we believe that a significant level of research and development is required to remain competitive and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to product development and engineering in future periods 
in addition  our product development depends  in part  on licenses received from third parties for technology that is incorporated into our products 
competition our markets are intensely competitive 
in the market for comprehensive software development solutions  we face competition from some of the largest software providers in the world 
for example  ibm  microsoft  sun microsystems  bea systems  mercury interactive  compuware  serena  computer associates  bmc and others today provide or have stated they intend to provide more comprehensive enterprise software development and integration solutions 
we attempt to differentiate our products and solutions from those of our competitors based on cross platform interoperability  integration with process optimization and skills educational services  total cost of ownership  product quality  performance  and reliability 
in the market for our individual product offerings  we face competition from the same companies above  as well as telelogic  iona  open source initiatives  and several smaller companies 
we compete in these markets on cross platform interoperability  ability to integrate with other products  price  product quality  product functionality  brand  distribution and reputation 
manufacturing our product development groups produce a set of master cd roms or diskettes and documentation for each of our products  which are then sent to manufacturing 
all of our manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by outside contractors under the supervision of our logistics organization 
this process includes replication of cd roms or diskettes  printing and production of documentation and packaging materials and 
table of contents assembly of final product packages for shipment to customers 
our products are sold in cd rom or diskette format with user documentation or delivered directly to our customers via electronic download 
we believe that there are adequate supplies and sources for the raw materials used in our products and that there are multiple sources available for cd rom or diskette replication  printing and production of packaging materials and printing of documentation 
intellectual property our success depends upon our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we currently have over patents issued in the united states that expire between and employees as of march   we employed  employees  of whom were engaged in selling  general and administrative functions and were engaged in research and development 
we have also employed temporary contract employees both in foreign countries and within the united states 
to our knowledge  none of our us employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union  and we have experienced no work stoppages 
employees of some of our foreign subsidiaries are represented by workers councils or other similar organizations as required or permitted by local law 
we believe that relations with our employees are generally good

item a 
risk factors we are in the midst of focusing the company on the development and distribution of enterprise software development solutions and divesting our individual software development tools 
if we are unable to successfully complete this change quickly and smoothly  our operating results could be harmed 
we are undergoing a change from a company that develops and delivers various product lines targeted to multiple individual markets to one that focuses primarily on the development and distribution of enterprise software development solutions 
in support of this transformation  we acquired segue software  inc segue in april and  in february  we announced our intention to seek a buyer for our ide products 
this change involves many aspects each of which involves substantial risks  including changes in go to market strategy 
to achieve revenue growth  we must enhance our enterprise selling capability  increase sales force productivity and generally complete more large revenue  multi product sales of our alm solution set 
we will also need to further define our roadmaps  integrate the segue software quality optimization products and other acquired products into our alm solution set  and generally continue to evolve our alm offerings to our sdo vision 
to do so  we must coordinate the efforts of our marketing  sales  services and research and development organizations to focus on the needs of large enterprises 
these tasks are complicated  involve many people and processes  and require consistency and persistence in the market place to be effective 
in addition  this enterprise go to market strategy involves different skills  partners and competencies than the channel go to market strategy historically used for the ide products 
if we fail to coordinate our efforts and deliver broader value to our customers  we will not satisfy the demands of the large enterprise customers that we are targeting and our revenues will suffer 

table of contents changes in our sales organization and sales leadership 
the transition to our new business model requires that we focus our sales effort on enterprise customers 
to drive these changes  we have made and will continue to make changes throughout our global sales force  particularly in europe and japan where productivity has been below expectations 
these efforts may prove unsuccessful in increasing our sales to enterprise customers 
changes in our sales cycles 
sales to large enterprises often involve long and unpredictable sales cycles 
as we rely more on selling enterprise solutions  we will also become more dependent on large revenue  multi product transactions to meet our revenue expectations 
given our relative inexperience in serving enterprise customers and our increased dependency on larger revenue deals with longer sales cycles  we may be unable to accurately forecast revenues derived from these customers 
if we fail to accurately forecast revenues  we may not achieve the financial performance that we anticipate  which could harm our business 
changes in our marketing strategy 
as part of our transition  we have been and are continuing to redefine our marketing strategy 
our focus is on increasing lead generation and developing appropriate enterprise level messaging  all in an effort to provide the necessary tools to our sales organization to sell to the enterprise customer 
as an organization  we are relatively new at this 
if we are unable to develop effective marketing programs and increase our pipeline of sales opportunities  or if our sales organization in turn is unable to effectively convert leads into customers  our revenues will suffer 
changes in the make up of our management team 
several members of our management team and senior personnel in a wide range of managerial roles recently joined borland  including our new president and ceo who joined borland in november as a result  our management team has a relatively short history working together  and there is risk that they will be able to manage the company effectively  especially in the face of the dramatic change related to a major acquisition and divestiture of products 
in addition  we are currently searching for a new head of worldwide research and development 
failure to find a suitable candidate in a timely fashion could delay or hamper our efforts to streamline and enhance our research and development activities 
during this transition in leadership and our business  our customers may decide to defer purchasing or decide not to purchase at all  we may experience employee distraction  or we may see increased competitive pressure as our competitors attempt to use this period of change to their advantage 
if we are unable to effectively manage through this transition quickly and effectively  our revenues could be harmed 
changes in our corporate structure 
the acquisition of segue and the potential divestiture of the ide products represent two very different transactions 
the segue transaction relates to building on our enterprise software development solutions 
the ide products divestiture represents the disposition of individual products delivered to the market largely though a global channel network 
both transactions are complex  and carry risks related to both our potential failure to complete them  and our failure to realize the benefits we expect from their completion 
in addition  executing on both transactions will require a concurrent effort to align our organization  change our business processes  update our financial and it systems  and generally evolve our day to day operations 
failure to successfully transition our people and processes and systems could harm our business 
changes in our services organization 
we are current planning on make significant changes to our services organization 
we expect to combine our consulting services and sales organizations to better focus on customer engagements 
we also expect to combine our technical support organization with our research and development organization to more closely align customer feedback on our products with our development efforts 
such changes will require careful planning and coordination to ensure we maintain customer satisfaction 
in addition  such changes may result in loss of key services personnel 
in the event customer satisfaction is harmed or we lose key personnel  our business could be harmed 
there are several other types of risks inherent in our transformation  generally described in the following paragraphs and throughout this document 
while we believe that changing the organization to focus on the development and delivery of comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers is critical to growing our business  
table of contents we may be unable to complete this process smoothly and quickly 
if we are unable to manage this change smoothly and quickly  our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects will be harmed 
additionally  in consideration of expenses associated with the integration of segue and those associated with our announced plan to seek a buyer for our ide products  as well as the resultant changes each will require in our organization  we expect to operate unprofitably for at least the first three quarters of we may be unable to integrate our operations successfully and realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger with segue 
the acquisition of segue is a significant transaction for us 
the acquisition price was approximately million in cash  which represented more than half of our cash balances at december  we have made several assumptions regarding cost and revenue synergies for the combined company  many of which are dependent upon how successful we are in integrating operations of the two companies 
segue has its headquarters in lexington  massachusetts  and has significant development and technical support centers in linz  austria and belfast  ireland 
we do not have a significant presence in any of these locations 
the acquisition involves the integration of two companies that previously have operated independently  which is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the companies operations include  among other things the necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds  consolidating corporate and administrative functions  consolidating research and development operations  coordinating sales and marketing functions  persuading employees that the borland and segue business cultures are compatible  maintaining morale and retaining key employees  in particular those in sales and software engineering positions  preserving the research and development  collaboration  distribution  marketing  promotion and other important relationships of borland and segue  while coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products and technologies with reduced costs  demonstrating to customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus  training our respective sales forces with regard to each other s technologies and how to effectively sell them  coordinating and combining international operations  relationships and facilities  which may be subject to additional risks  costs and constraints imposed by local laws and regulations  managing integration issues of our acquired businesses shortly after  simultaneously with  or pending the completion of other acquisitions or divestitures  maintaining productivity and support while consolidating the corporate information technology infrastructure  and combining product offerings and preventing customers from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and our willingness to support and service existing products 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business and the loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the acquisition and the integration of the two companies operations could harm the business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects of the combined company after the merger 

table of contents among the factors considered by our board of directors in connection with its approval of the merger agreement were the opportunities for cost savings from operating efficiencies that could result from the acquisition 
we can not be certain that these savings will be realized within the time periods contemplated or that they will be realized at all 
we also can not be certain that the integration of borland and segue will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the acquisition 
the potential divestiture of our ide products is important for the future growth and profitability of our business  and our failure to efficiently divest these products or divest them at all could harm our business 
the potential divestiture of our ide products is a significant transaction for us 
the ide products are generally mature products and require less support and maintenance and therefore carry significant product line margins 
the go to market model for the ide products however has generally required an extensive management  sales and office presence throughout the world  which has been expensive to maintain 
the market for our ide products  particularly jbuilder  has become increasingly commoditized 
this is due in part to the overall increase in the utilization of open source software technologies  including the growing popularity of eclipse an open source initiative that provides  among other things  development tools  frameworks  and foundational ide technology at little or no charge 
revenue from our ide products has thus declined significantly as a group in recent years 
if we are unable to efficiently divest the ide products or unable to find a buyer at all  we will continue to be subject to these market trends and organizational dynamics  which would make it difficult to grow our business overall 
the ide products are an integrated part of our overall worldwide operations 
the process for divesting the product lines will involve many complicated tasks  including identifying and dedicating personnel to the ide products  shifting work responsibilities among existing personnel  identifying and separating customer and partner relationships  identifying and separating assets  and identifying and separating intellectual property 
in addition  we anticipate the divestiture will require us to provide a series of transition services to the buyer for a period of time  including access to facilities  network connectivity  communications  development systems  it systems and financial reporting 
any divestiture will thus be difficult  complex and costly to implement  and a failure to implement such divestiture smoothly and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the potential divestiture could have a disruptive effect on our current business 
customers may decide to delay purchases pending the outcome of the divestiture  and competitors may target our installed base of customers to switch to their products 
either of these factors could cause revenues to decline in the short term 
the potential divestiture may cause us to incur material expenses 
we may also incur indemnification obligations for liabilities  losses or expenses arising in connection with the sale of the ide products 
there is no assurance that upon completion of the ide divestiture we will be able to achieve greater profitability  strengthen our core operations or compete more effectively in existing or new markets 
entering into such a divestiture transaction may entail risks and uncertainties in addition to those which may result from the divestiture related changes to our business  including but not limited to extraordinary transaction costs  unknown indemnification liabilities and unforeseen administrative complications  any of which could result in reduced revenues  increased charges or post transaction administrative costs or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  our failure to complete the divestiture  failure to divest our ide products on advantageous terms or our inability to successfully implement and execute such divestiture could jeopardize our future growth and profitability 
we would be forced to determine whether to attempt to divest the ide products again  continue to operate the ide products or explore another strategic alternative 
if we try to divest the ide products at a later time  we would need to expend significant time and resources that would otherwise be used to operate our business and we would likely have to divest the ide products on terms that could be less favorable to us than the terms we currently anticipate being able to obtain 

table of contents our plans for the restructuring of our company are complex  and our failure to complete the restructuring effectively could adversely effect our business 
we are attempting to integrate our acquisition of segue and to complete the divestiture of our ide products at substantially the same time 
both transactions are complex  and carry risks related both to our potential failure to complete them  and our potential failure to realize the benefits we expect following completion 
in addition  pursuing such transactions at substantially the same time may entail risks and uncertainties in addition to those which may result from either the acquisition or the divestiture alone  including but not limited to extraordinary transaction costs  unknown indemnification liabilities and unforeseen administrative and operational complications  any of which could result in reduced revenues  increased charges or post transaction administrative costs or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the process of purchasing a business and selling assets could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the company s business and the distraction of employees or the loss of key personnel 
the activities involved are complicated and detailed  and they will put strain on the organization 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with completing the merger  the integration of operations  and the divestiture of our ide products at substantially the same time could harm our overall business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects to an even greater extent than either the acquisition or the divestiture alone 
there is no guarantee that these transactions will have the anticipated results  or that these transactions will present the advantages that we anticipate towards our goal of becoming a company focused on development and distribution of enterprise software development solutions 
we will need to realign our research and development organization in connection with the acquisition of segue and the ide products divestiture 
we will have a substantial number of new research and development personnel join us through the segue acquisition  and we will have a substantial number of existing research and development personnel exit the company through the ide divestiture 
in addition  we may need to consolidate or close certain research and development locations 
these personnel additions and subtractions will occur in different geographical locations around the world and will require a coordinated management and training effort 
the changes will also affect the mix of personnel and skills in various engineering locations  which will require an evolution and rationalization of the research and development approach 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process including the potential loss of technical talent  the possibility of disruption or distractions in developing products  delays in shipping products  and the potential for product quality to suffer 
we are currently searching for a new head of worldwide research and development 
failure to find a suitable candidate in a timely fashion could delay or hamper our efforts to streamline and enhance our research and development approach 
we are relatively new to marketing and selling comprehensive solutions for the application development lifecycle  and we may not be able to successfully compete in this broader market 
the application development lifecycle market is evolving  and customers are increasingly demanding software that integrates and addresses each stage of the application development lifecycle 
historically  we have focused on selling point products for particular segments of the application development lifecycle  most notably ide development tools 
we have done this utilizing a combination of an indirect sales channel that sells individual point products and a direct sales force that manages larger accounts on the basis of geography 
over the past several quarters  we have focused our sales efforts on selling enterprise solutions to large customers  as our future growth will depend in large measure on our ability to sell comprehensive alm solutions to these larger enterprises 
selling enterprise solutions to large customers represents a fundamentally different go to market approach than selling through the channel 
to that end  we have substantially changed our business model  hired and allocated many new sales personnel dedicated exclusively to named enterprise accounts and built plans around augmenting our selling efforts with and through large technology and market 
table of contents facing partners 
however  we may be unable to transition effectively to selling these solutions to large enterprises 
to compete successfully in the enterprise account market  we believe we will need to develop stronger relationships with systems integrators and other strategic partners with access to enterprise accounts  develop stronger relationships with executive level information technology professionals and other executives responsible for making enterprise wide purchasing decisions  develop and reinforce messaging focused on executive level information technology professionals  leverage our professional services organization to expand product opportunities within an enterprise customer  and compete with several very large and well established companies with more experience in these markets 
we do not have extensive experience in these areas 
if we are unable to do any of the foregoing  our revenues could suffer 
our increasing focus on enterprise customers may lengthen our sales cycles  which may delay sales beyond forecasted quarters and increase fluctuations in our financial results 
as we seek to license our software directly to large enterprises  we have experienced sales cycles that are substantially more lengthy and uncertain than those associated with our traditional business of licensing software through indirect and retail channels and more modest direct sales 
as we focus on large transactions that involve multiple elements  enterprise customers generally require us to expend substantial time  effort and money in establishing a relationship and in educating them about our solutions 
also  sales to enterprise customers generally require an extensive sales effort throughout many levels within the customer s organization and often require final approval by several layers of executives  including the customer s chief information officer  chief financial officer and or other senior executive employee 
these factors substantially extend the sales cycle and increase the uncertainty of whether a sale will be made in any particular quarter  or at all 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays and uncertainties in our sales cycles as well as increased up front expenses in connection with our enterprise sales efforts 
the timing of the execution of enterprise volume licenses could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  especially when we anticipate that certain transactions will close in a particular quarter 
further  industry buying patterns suggest that larger transactions are frequently deferred until later in the quarter  creating increased difficulty in quarterly forecasting 
finally  if a sale is never completed despite months or even years of selling efforts  we will have expended substantial time  money and resources during the pre sales effort without generating any revenue to offset these expenses 
our success is dependent upon our ability to enhance the quality and scalability of our various products  improve the integration and overall functionality of these products as part of our alm software development solutions  and evolve our alm solution toward our vision of sdo 
we produce and sell a broad portfolio of products to manage the software development process 
the market for these products is characterized by continuous technological advancement  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
a significant portion of our research and development focus is on integrating many of our existing point products and recently acquired products into a cohesive alm software development solution 
managing our development activities through our enterprise transformation is complex and involves a number of risks  especially with respect to maintaining competitiveness across our individual products while at the same time bolstering the integration and functionality of our products as part of our alm solution 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in designing and marketing new products  integrating acquired products  providing the necessary product enhancements or features to address increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers or in enhancing the integration and functionality of our alm platform 

table of contents in addition  our customers use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software and operating platforms  adding to our development challenges 
we invest and will continue to invest significant resources to develop products for new or emerging software and hardware platforms in the server  desktop  mobile and other environments that may develop from time to time 
however  there is a risk that a new hardware or software platform for which we do not provide products could rapidly grow in popularity 
in particular  we believe that this risk is substantial for particular proprietary platforms and languages for which we may not be given economically feasible access or access at all 
as a result  we may not be in a position to develop products for such platforms or may be late in doing so 
if we fail to introduce new products that address the needs of emerging market segments or if our new products do not achieve market acceptance as a result of delays in development or other factors  our future growth and revenue opportunity could suffer 
if we are unable to maintain revenue levels for our deployment products  our financial results may be harmed 
we currently have a significant amount of our revenue attributable to our deployment products 
these products are mature products and we primarily rely on new sales to existing customers  compliance purchases through customer audits and sales through existing isv and oem partners to generate revenue 
we have from time to time experienced unexpected weakness and fluctuations in revenue from these products and believe they may be subject to commoditization 
our deployment products are generally based on older standards and technologies  which increasingly are used only in more select industries  networks and applications 
we devote little marketing to these products and primarily rely on the effectiveness of the sales force and compliance teams to work with customers and partners to generate sales 
there have been many changes in the sales force over the past several quarters  and we anticipate changes will continue to take place over the coming quarters  especially in europe where we have historically generated a significant amount of revenue from our deployment products 
these changes and the activities associated with the acquisition of segue and the potential divestiture of the ide products puts pressure on our ability to focus and execute 
if we are unable to maintain effective sales programs for our deployment products  or if customers begin to migrate away from our deployment products  our business and results of operation will suffer 
we are new at delivering large services projects and failure to manage these engagements could harm our margins and adversely affect our results of operations 
we have recently begun entering into large  complex professional services agreements 
we have little prior experience in services engagements of this scale 
our inability to structure and manage services agreements may result in unanticipated changes to the timing of our services revenue 
in addition  if we bundle services together with our license agreements  this may also affect the timing of recognizing our license revenue 
we will need to implement new systems or upgrade current systems to manage these large  complex services agreements 
if our systems fail or if our services agreements lead to unanticipated changes to the timing of revenue recognition  then our results of operations and sufficiency of our internal controls could be harmed 
our inability to forecast our revenue pipeline or convert revenue pipeline into contracts could adversely affect our revenues 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all potential transactions  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of each transaction 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period 
for example  we have had difficulties in forecasting our alm pipeline in europe and japan 
when customers delay purchasing decisions  reduce in amount the purchase or cancel the purchase altogether  it will reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts and our revenues will be harmed 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner 
our inability to respond to a 
table of contents variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  or at all  could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our results of operations 
because competition for qualified technical and management personnel is intense  we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel  which could harm our business 
we believe our ability to successfully grow and manage our business and to develop new products depends  in large part  on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees  particularly highly skilled software engineers  sales personnel and management personnel 
competition for qualified technical and management personnel is intense and in particular  the job market in the silicon valley is beginning to recover  offering alternate opportunities to employees 
in addition  in the past some of our competitors have also utilized their greater resources to provide substantial signing bonuses and other inducements to lure key personnel away from us 
we employ a variety of measures to retain our key people  including the grant of stock options  restricted stock and use of promotions and bonuses 
however  due to our financial performance in  no bonus payments were made under our incentive compensation plan in the first half of  which has adversely affected employee morale and which may lead to employee turnover 
we have made efforts to utilize equity based compensation as part of an overall retention program to retain certain key employees  however  we are not certain that our efforts will succeed  and our failure to attract and retain key personnel could significantly harm our business 
if we are unable to recruit and retain quality personnel  our ability to provide competitive products could be harmed 
as a result  we may lose customers or may not achieve anticipated sales during a particular period 
in addition  the loss of technical talent may result in our being unable to ship new products or product upgrades at the times that we originally planned 
if we experience delays in the shipment of new products or product upgrades  we may be unable to achieve anticipated sales during a particular period 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of equity compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interest with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation packages 
the decline of our stock price over the last year has made stock options a less attractive portion of our employee compensation program 
hence  we may find it increasingly difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
a number of factors affecting our revenues make our future results for a particular period difficult to predict  and therefore we may not meet expectations for a particular period 
we believe that our revenues have the potential to vary significantly from time to time 
these variations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
we believe that these variations may result from many factors  including  but not limited to issues resulting from the segue acquisition and from divesting our ide products  our limited experience in selling large revenue  multiple product enterprise solutions  the size and timing of significant orders and their fulfillment  commoditization in our deployment products  or shifting buying patterns of customers of those products  product defects that may be discovered from time to time and other product quality problems  our limited sophistication in consistently forecasting revenues across our geographic regions in light of our transition to an enterprise software company  the relative mix of demand for our various products and services  especially in light of our increased focus on our services organization  timing  and any delay in the introduction  of upgrades or localizations to existing products or releases of new products  and changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors 

table of contents our revenues may also be affected in the short term as a result of not meeting analyst expectations in recent quarters as customers may defer or delay purchasing decisions 
as a result of the foregoing  revenues may be difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenues for a quarterly period may not be known until late in the quarter 
additionally  our costs  while based on projected revenues  are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  if our revenue levels fall below projections  anticipated profitability will suffer 
additionally  the significant demands placed on our organization due to the segue acquisition and announced divestiture could adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast costs to our previous tolerances 
as a result  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results will continue to be difficult to forecast  and period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of trends or our future performance 
failure to successfully deliver on large transactions may impair our ability to maintain existing and establish new relationships with enterprise level customers 
our reputation  growth and ability to expand our base of enterprise level customers  depends on the execution of large scale transactions 
because we are new to providing products and services to enterprise level customers  our success will depend on our ability to deploy our products across an enterprise and to deliver products that perform as promised 
to be successful in the enterprise market  we must be able to provide high quality products that can scale across the enterprise 
in addition  our success will depend on our ability to properly scale our services organization in order to provide the necessary consulting  education and technical support services needed to successfully deploy our products 
if we are unable to provide acceptable products  or our products are unable to scale effectively with enterprise level customers  or if we fail to provide adequate professional services to the enterprise customer  we will not be able to execute on our large scale implementations 
should this happen  we may lose existing customers and our reputation would be harmed  each of which would cause our revenues to decline 
if we fail to establish strategic relationships with systems integrators or if we are unable to offer adequate services to support existing relationships with systems integrators  our ability to sell comprehensive solutions to enterprise customers will be harmed 
we believe that growth in our license revenues will depend on our ability to provide our customers with professional services that support the utilization of our products 
this will require establishing stronger relationships with the large systems integrators that have experience implementing enterprise solutions across large organizations 
we believe these systems integrators are important to our sales  marketing and support activities with enterprise customers given their access to large enterprises 
if successful  we believe that these relationships will expand the distribution of our products 
in addition  to succeed in establishing successful relationships with systems integrators  we need to provide services that complement their core service offerings 
these professional services include maintenance  architectural consulting  training  education  technical support and project management 
we are presently expanding the breadth and depth of our worldwide services organization 
if we fail to properly hire and scale our worldwide services organization  and hire talent with the correct skill sets  we may not be able to provide the services that complement the core offerings of these systems integrators 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing good relations with large systems integrators  our ability to sell our solutions to large enterprises will be greatly diminished  and as a consequence  our revenues will be harmed 
we may not be able to successfully compete against current and potential competitors 
our markets are intensely competitive 
in the market for comprehensive software development solutions  we face competition from some of the largest software providers in the world 
for example  ibm  microsoft  sun microsystems  bea systems  mercury interactive  computer associates  bmc and others today provide or have stated they intend to provide more comprehensive enterprise software development and integration solutions 
presently  some of these competitors partner with us to enhance the depth of comprehensive solutions and enhance their reach to our established developer customer base  however  if strategies change and a larger market 
table of contents overlap results  some of these current partners could become more competitive 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  management  marketing and technical resources than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers  extensive knowledge of the market  substantial experience in selling enterprise solutions  strong professional services and technical support offerings and extensive product development  sales and marketing resources 
as a result of their greater resources and established relationships  these competitors may be more successful than we are at developing and marketing products and solutions in our markets 
in addition  the markets for our individual products are characterized by rapid change  new and emerging technologies  and aggressive competition 
some of our competitors include ibm  telelogic  mercury interactive  compuware  serena  bea systems  microsoft and sun microsystems 
we attempt to differentiate our products from those of our competitors based on interoperability  total cost of ownership  product quality  performance  level of integration and reliability 
in the future  we may be unable to successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors  or we may be unable to compete with the substantially greater resources that many of our competitors have 
if so  our business will suffer 
bundling arrangements or product give aways by our competitors  including available  cost free development technologies  may diminish demand for our products or pressure us to reduce our prices 
some of our competitors  particularly those that are primarily hardware vendors or platform providers  generate a substantially greater proportion of their sales in markets in which we do not directly compete 
we believe a number of these competitors view sales of software application lifecycle technologies as important to enhancing the functionality of  and the demand for  their core products 
as a result  these companies often bundle software products that compete with our offerings  with products such as application servers  work stations  personal computers  operating systems databases and information technology services 
when competitors do so  the effective price for their software products that compete with our software development platform solutions are often heavily discounted or offered at no charge 
this has required us to reduce the price of our products and related services in certain circumstances  sometimes to no avail 
similarly  industry alliances and arrangements exist or may be formed in the future under which our competitors ally with companies in markets in which we do not compete to bundle products 
these arrangements may also result in lower effective prices for our competitors products than for our products  putting pressure on our business and diminishing our competitive position 
the complexity of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to revenue recognition  could cause us to defer recognition of revenue  or recognize lower revenue and profits 
although we use standard agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standard agreements  particularly in multi product license and services transactions 
as our transactions increase in complexity with the sale of larger  multi product licenses  negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions may require us to defer recognition of revenue on such licenses 
we believe that we are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  however  these future  more complex  multi product license transactions may require additional accounting analysis to account for them accurately  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices and may contain terms affecting the timing of revenue recognition  which could affect the financial results for a given period 
our products may contain unknown defects that could result in a loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
software products occasionally contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
we cannot be certain that our products are or in the future will be completely free of defects and errors 
we could lose revenue as a result of product defects or errors  including defects contained in 
table of contents third party products that enable our products to work 
in addition  the discovery of a defect or error in a new version or product may result in the following consequences  among others delayed shipping of the product  delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  product liability claims  and increased service and warranty costs 
as we move away from selling individual point products towards selling enterprise wide solutions  we also expect our products to become more critical to our customer 
thus  a defect or error in our products could result in a significant disruption to our customer s business 
in addition  as we transition to selling larger  more complex solutions  there is also the risk that our current products will not prove scalable without substantial effort or that there is a market perception that our products are too complex 
if we are unable to develop products that are free of defects or errors or if our products are not able to scale across an enterprise or are perceived to be too complex to scale across an enterprise  our business could be harmed 
consolidation in our industry or fluctuation in our stock price may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation continues to occur among companies that compete in our markets 
additionally  some of the largest software and hardware providers in the world have sought to expand their software and services offerings through acquisitions in the software development  deployment and integration space 
for instance  in early  ibm acquired rational software  a provider of application lifecycle development products  and in purchased systemcorp  a provider of software development project and portfolio management products 
if these large providers  who have significantly greater financial  management  marketing and technical resources than we have  are successful in increasing their offerings in the software development market  then this will put significant pressure on our business and harm our ability to compete effectively 
additionally  changes resulting from these and other consolidations may harm our competitive position  particularly as certain products  when offered as part of a bundled suite  are offered for free or are given away to sell more hardware  infrastructure components or information technology services 
as the trend toward consolidation continues  we may encounter increased competition for attractive acquisition targets and may have to pay higher prices for those businesses or technologies we seek to acquire 
in addition  we have seen a recent decline in our stock price  which will in turn make it more difficult for us to use stock as a currency for the acquisition of strategic businesses or technologies 
this will put pressure on our ability to seek out potential acquisition targets which may impede our growth and our ability to compete effectively 
we depend on technologies licensed to us by third parties  such as sun microsystems and microsoft  and the loss of or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales or shipments of certain of our products 
we depend on licenses from third party suppliers for some elements of our products such as various file libraries 
in particular  we depend on technology licenses from sun microsystems for certain of our java products  and we depend on licenses from microsoft for our delphi  c builder  c builder and borland developer studio products 
if any of these licenses or other third party licenses were terminated or were not renewed  or if these third parties failed to notify us in a timely manner of any new or updated technology  we might not be able to ship such products as planned or provide support for such products  including upgrades 
we would then have to seek an alternative to the third party s technology and  in some cases  an alternative may not 
table of contents exist 
this could result in delays in releasing and or shipping our products  increased costs by having to secure unfavorable royalty arrangements or reduced functionality of our products  which in turn could substantially reduce our revenues 
our future success depends upon enhancing existing relationships and establishing new technology alliances 
the market for enterprise software application development and deployment solutions is broad  and our products and solutions must integrate with a wide variety of technologies 
to be successful  we must establish and enhance strategic alliances with a wide variety of companies in the software development ecosystem 
many of these companies have competitive products or have stated a desire to move broadly into the software development lifecycle space 
in addition  many of these companies are competitive with one another and approach partnering with us cautiously 
this has made it difficult in some cases to establish or enhance desired relationships or achieve intended objectives 
we currently have a number of important strategic alliances and technology relationships with industry leaders 
where we have established working relationships  our allies may choose to terminate their arrangements with us where no binding contractual arrangements exist 
the failure to develop or maintain our strategic alliances and technology relationships or our allies decision to opt out of their arrangements with us may impede our ability to introduce new products or enter new markets  and consequently harm our revenue prospects 
failure to manage our international operations could harm our financial results 
a substantial portion of our revenues is from international sales 
international sales accounted for of our revenues during the year ended december   with each of germany and the united kingdom accounting for significant portions of our total revenue 
in addition  a significant portion of our operations consists of activities outside the united states 
we now have research and development facilities in several domestic and international locations  and we have a direct sales force in place in more than twenty countries around the world 
we have a complicated corporate structure  and historically have had geographically dispersed operational controls 
in particular  we rely on personnel in our international locations to properly account for and manage our international operations  which introduces inherent difficulties in management and control 
given this  we may experience difficulty in efficiently and effectively managing our dispersed and complicated organization 
as a result  our results of operations may suffer 
in addition  we are subject to other risks inherent in doing business internationally  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the difficulty of staffing and managing an organization spread over various countries and continents  potentially reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights than is available under the laws of the united states  longer payment cycles in some countries and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  restrictions on the expatriation of currency  foreign taxes  export restrictions  tariffs  duties and other trade barriers  changes in regulatory requirements and resulting costs  differing cultures and business practices not consistent with our regulatory obligations in the united states  compliance with various conflicting laws and regulations  including employment laws  and resulting costs  and war  threats of war  terrorist activity or political or economic instability in certain parts of the world 
one or more of these risks could harm our future research operations and international sales 
if we are unable to manage these risks of doing business internationally  our results of operations could suffer 

table of contents we have begun the process of upgrading our oracle financial system in the united states and if we are unsuccessful in deploying the system or  if it takes longer than anticipated to deploy the system  we may incur significant additional costs which would negatively impact our financial results as well as potentially weaken our internal controls 
we anticipate upgrading our oracle financial system in the united states this year 
system upgrades are expensive and time consuming undertakings that impact all areas of the company 
while a successful implementation will provide us with many benefits  an unsuccessful or delayed implementation will cost us significant time and resources  as well as expense 
implementing a new financial system raises costs and risks inherent in any upgrade to a computer system  including  but not limited to  disruption to our normal accounting procedures such as order entry  fulfillment and billing  as well as problems achieving accuracy in data conversion 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in increased costs  the diversion of management s attention and resources and the inability to forecast revenues and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
this may result in increased costs and could negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  due to the systemic internal control features within financial systems  any changes in our financial system will have an impact on the testing of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
we  and our independent registered public accounting firm  have determined that we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have dedicated a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with this legislation for the year ended december  and will continue to do so for future fiscal periods 
we may encounter problems or delays in completing the review and evaluation  the implementation of improvements and the receipt of a positive attestation  or any attestation at all  by our independent registered public accounting firm 
additionally  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors 
we announced on march  that we were delaying our filing of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  in order for the audit committee of our board of directors to conduct a review  with the assistance of outside advisors  of third party contractor liabilities and accrued expenses and a potential customer refund obligation the review 
the audit committee s review is now complete 
as a result of this review  management identified material weaknesses insofar as we did not maintain effective controls over third party contractor invoices and contracts and we did not maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso with respect to senior management s role in promoting compliance with policies and procedures and the prevention or detection of the override of our controls 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
because of these material weaknesses  our management concluded that  as of december   we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
as a result  pricewaterhousecoopers llp has issued an adverse opinion with respect to our internal control over financial reporting and their report is included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents we assign a high priority to the improvement of our internal control over financial reporting 
we currently expect to implement new training courses for senior personnel throughout the company attended by our chief executive officer 
in addition  we intend to institute procedures that will require that third party contractor hours be tracked in a separate system and reconciled with the time recorded on invoices received 
we also intend to require new certifications of our senior personnel concerning invoicing  billing and customer commitments 
we intend to finalize and implement these measures at the earliest practicable date 
if we fail to remedy our material weaknesses or should we  or our independent registered public accounting firm  determine in future fiscal periods that we have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted  and our results of operations or financial condition may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
we may incur future impairment losses related to intangible assets from prior acquisitions that could harm our future operating results 
in the past few years  we have acquired significant assets and businesses 
if the assets and businesses do not perform as expected  we may be required to take impairment charges related to the intangible assets from these acquisitions 
such charges could harm our operating results 
recent changes in accounting for equity compensation could adversely affect our earnings and could require a modification to our equity compensation strategy  which could impact our ability to attract and retain employees 
we accounted for stock options under apb through the end of fiscal and  accordingly  recorded compensation expense related to stock options if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of grant 
on december   the fasb issued sfas r  which will require us to expense stock options in our statement of operations 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for sfas r which will delay the effective date of compliance for us to fiscal sfas r applies to all outstanding stock options that are not vested at the effective date and grants of new stock options made subsequent to the effective date 
we adopted sfas r on january  compensation charges under sfas r will be affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we estimate that our earnings in could be reduced significantly  which will make it substantially more likely that we could experience net losses 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of equity compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the changing regulatory landscape could make it more difficult and expensive for us to grant stock options to employees in the future 
if employees believe that the incentives that they would receive under a modified strategy are less attractive  we may find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
in addition  the use of alternative equity incentives may increase our compensation expense and may negatively impact our earnings 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity instruments to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  further change our equity compensation strategy or find it increasingly difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets 
as a software company  our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements and other methods to protect our intellectual property rights  but these measures may provide only 
table of contents limited protection 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriations of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse engineer or decompile our software products 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights  particularly in certain international markets  making misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely 
litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights  and such litigation can be time consuming and expensive 
third party claims of intellectual property infringement may subject us to costly litigation or settlement terms or limit the sales of our products 
from time to time  we have received notices claiming that we have infringed a third party s patent or other intellectual property right 
we expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase  the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality becomes more widespread 
further  the receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require in some situations that a costly opinion of counsel be obtained to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement 
regardless of its merits  responding to any claim can be time consuming and costly and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of a successful claim against us  we may be required to pay significant monetary damages  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  discontinue the use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology and or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that might not be offered or be available on acceptable terms 
if a successful claim were made against us and we failed to commercially develop or license a substitute technology  our business could be harmed 
in addition  we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims or our insurance coverage for these types of claims may not be adequate

item legal proceedings on november   a stockholder class action and derivative lawsuit  dieterich v 
harrer  et al  case no 
cc  was filed against starbase corporation  or starbase  and five former directors of starbase in the superior court of the state of california for orange county  claiming that the former directors had breached fiduciary duties owed to starbase and stockholders of starbase 
we are paying the costs of defending this litigation pursuant to indemnification obligations under the merger agreement relating to our acquisition of starbase 
following a series of motions  the case was dismissed without prejudice on august  on october   a stockholder class action relating to the same matter  dieterich v 
harrer  et al  case no 
n  was filed against the former directors of starbase in chancery court of the state of delaware  alleging breach of fiduciary duties by the former directors of starbase 
the lawsuit also named as defendants borland and the following four former executive officers of borland dale fuller  keith gottfried  frederick ball  and doug barre 
defendants moved to dismiss and in august  the chancery court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss 
discovery commenced in the second half of subsequently  there were discussions with the plaintiff concerning a possible settlement of the litigation 
as a result of these discussions  a settlement was reached 
under the settlement we agreed to pay  and actual costs to administer the settlement fund up to a maximum of  in exchange for dismissal of the action and a full and general release of all claims relating to or concerning the factual and legal allegations in the complaint with the sole exception of claims by former starbase shareholders who contend they did not receive the full consideration to which they were entitled from the acquisition by borland 
the settlement is conditioned 
table of contents on certification of the plaintiff class  approval by the delaware chancery court and satisfaction of all other legal requirements 
the parties executed a stipulation of settlement and proposed scheduling order that was signed by the vice chancellor on march  this triggered the requirement by borland to fund the  settlement as well as the  for administration fees within five business days 
we funded the settlement within the required time limit 
the court set a date of june  for a fairness hearing at which time the vice chancellor will consider any objections to the settlement and determine whether to approve the settlement 
there is no assurance that the vice chancellor will approve the settlement 
in addition  an objecting shareholder could appeal the approval of the settlement 
if the settlement does not become final  the parties could resume litigation or attempt to renegotiate the settlement 
from time to time  we may be involved in other lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  consisting of intellectual property  commercial  employment and other matters  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  however  we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us  as well as adequate accruals for any probable and estimable losses 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations for that period 
we believe that  except as described above  given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances  even were we to receive an adverse judgment with respect to litigation that we are currently a party to  it is likely that such a judgment would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
from time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights  disputing royalties  or disputing other commercial arrangements 
regardless of the merit of any such claim  responding to these claims could be time consuming and expensive  and may require us to enter into licensing or royalty agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we expect that our software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment increases  the functionality of products overlap and industry participants become more aggressive in using patents offensively

overview borland is a global leader in software delivery optimization sdo  which is the transformation of software development from separate tasks into a managed and efficient business process 
to assist organizations with this transformation  we offer platform independent application lifecycle management alm software designed to increase efficiency  visibility and control over all phases of the software delivery lifecycle from deciding which software to create  to defining  developing and delivering that software 
we also offer software process improvement services and educational services to customers across the world 
we believe this combination of alm technology  process expertise and skills training combine to help customers manage the growing complexity of software development and provide a foundation for delivering high quality software  on time  on budget  with increased business value 
we are evolving our business to provide more multi product enterprise class software development solutions that include significant services 
as part of our ongoing business evolution  in february  we announced a plan to aggressively drive our alm business and sdo strategy forward 
as part of that plan  we entered into a merger agreement to acquire segue software  inc  or segue  a provider of global quality and testing solutions 
the acquisition of segue was completed on april  for the year ended december   segue reported net revenue of million  up from  and software license revenue of million  up from segue also reported net income in of million  as compared to net income in of million 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we paid per share in cash for all outstanding shares of segue 
the transaction was valued at approximately million and we funded the acquisition with existing cash on hand 
in addition  as part of our plan to focus on alm and our overall sdo strategy  we announced plans to seek a buyer for our integrated developer environment  or ide  products  which includes the borland developer studio delphi  c builder  and c builder  jbuilder and interbase product lines 
revenue from the ide products were approximately million or approximately of total revenue in the year ended december   a decline of approximately million from historically our business operations for all of our products have been integrated and managed as a collective whole  and thus precise expenses attributable to individual products are not determinable 
the ide products are generally mature products and require less support and maintenance and therefore carry significant product line margins 
the go to market model for the ide products however has generally required an extensive management  sales and office presence throughout the world  which has been expensive to maintain 
we are currently analyzing the impact of the acquisition of segue and the potential ide divestiture will have on our business and future financial performance 
we expect in the short term to experience disruption and change and anticipate our financial performance could suffer in the next several quarters 
we anticipate we will make organizational and operational changes around the segue acquisition and the potential ide divestiture  which may include closure of certain facilities  layoffs of redundant workforce and overall streamlining of sales  services and research and development operations 
we are still in the planning stages and the exact nature and quantification of these changes has yet to be determined 
our overall goal of these changes is to create an improved revenue growth model in the long term 
additionally  in consideration of expenses associated with the integration of segue and those associated with our announced plan to seek a buyer for our ide products  as well as the resultant changes each will require in our organization  we expect to operate unprofitably for at least the first three quarters of 
table of contents management continues to assess significant assumptions and estimates after the end of each financial period  through the filing date  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
based upon an assessment of estimates and assumptions prior to the filing of this annual report on form k  but subsequent to management s press release on february  of preliminary  unaudited results of operations  we determined that certain sales expenses for the year ended december  should be increased by million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
changes in these accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by us 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations  and contingencies and litigation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
in addition to these estimates and assumptions that are utilized in the preparation of historical financial statements  we make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenue 
specifically  our sales personnel monitor the status of proposals  including the estimated closing dates and potential dollar amounts 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using the best available data at the time  which is subject to change 
the inability to properly estimate the timing and amount of future revenues could significantly affect our future operations 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
to be specific  an enterprise software financial model includes expenses which are substantially fixed in the near term  and revenues that may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are typically recorded in the latter part of a given quarter  therefore  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline in a timely manner  and such delays may adversely and materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of those critical accounting polices and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures related to our critical accounting polices and estimates in this report 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from licenses of our software and sales of related services  which include  post contract customer support  or pcs  consulting and education 
we recognize license fees on contracts that do not involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products upon delivery when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
for arrangements with multiple 
table of contents elements  we determine the value for services based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop  and related accounting literature 
vsoe for the consulting services element is based upon the standard rates we charge for services  given the complexity of the services and experience of the professional performing the services or the amount charged on similar transactions 
vsoe for annual pcs is established with the stated future renewal rates included in the contracts or the amount charged on a similar transaction or other specific evidence 
we recognize revenue for the license portion of a multiple element arrangement based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we determine that a fee is not fixed or determinable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue as the fee becomes due 
we generally recognize revenue for software licensed for a specific time period  or license term  ratably over the term of the license 
historically  we developed solutions providing specific functionality to certain hardware vendors 
these solutions may involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products 
we recognize license and service revenues associated with contracts involving significant implementation  integration or new functionality  either on a percentage of completion basis or a completed contract basis depending on whether or not we can obtain reliable estimates of the costs to complete the work 
percentage of completion accounting often involves complex accounting decisions  judgments and estimates as to future costs and recoverability of unbilled amounts 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and or service revenues  based upon the estimated fair value of each element based upon vsoe 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
during  and we did not account for any consulting contracts on a completed contract basis 
service revenues from consulting and education services related to the implementation of our software are recognized when services are performed 
service revenues from our process consulting services are recognized based on when services are performed or when certain milestones have been met  depending on our arrangement with the customer 
for process consulting services  we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab service revenues from pcs are recognized ratably over the support period  which is generally one year 
net revenue on our products held by our distributors is recognized upon sell through to their customers and we maintain allowances for returns for all unsold products held by our distributors 
additionally  we maintain allowances for product returns from our channel resellers and end users  whose revenues are recognized on a sell in basis  based upon historical return rates  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
management makes significant judgments and estimates when establishing our sales returns and other allowances  especially when concerning channel resellers 
the provision for sales returns and rebates amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reserve for sales returns and rebates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the provision for sales returns and rebates is recorded as a reduction to license and other revenues in the period that the accrual is considered necessary 
the reserve balance is recorded in the balance sheet as an accounts receivable allowance 
if future returns and rebates increase over historical levels  additional allowances may be required 
as we move into enterprise solution selling  we will become more dependent on large revenue  multi product transactions to meet our revenue expectations 
large revenue  multi product transactions typically involve longer sales cycles and the timing of these deals could cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents accounting for acquisitions in october  we completed the acquisition of privately held legadero 
legadero is a texas based provider of information technology management and governance solutions for software development and delivery 
the purchase price consisted of fixed consideration of million in cash plus contingent consideration of million for retention payments to be earned through the continued employment of certain key employees 
this contingent consideration vests and will be paid over a two year period or earlier under certain circumstances and will be recognized as compensation expense in the period earned 
in addition  we incurred million of acquisition related costs 
options to purchase  shares of common stock pursuant to our supplemental stock option plan were issued to legadero employees who are now our employees 
these options vest over a four year period 
cash acquired in the acquisition was million 
the results of operations for legadero have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in january  we completed the acquisition of privately held teraquest 
teraquest was a texas based consulting firm focusing on software improvement  quality assurance and risk management for corporate and government software organizations 
the purchase price consisted of fixed consideration of million in cash and million of acquisition related costs 
the contingent consideration includes cash retention payments of million to be earned through the continued employment of certain key employees 
this contingent consideration will vest and be paid over a two year period or earlier under certain circumstances 
in addition  million of restricted stock  which will vest over a four year period  was issued to certain teraquest key employees upon the closing 
cash acquired in the acquisition was million 
results of operations for teraquest have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in january  we completed the acquisition of privately held togethersoft for million in cash   shares of borland common stock and the assumption of togethersoft s stock option plans 
at december   approximately million of the total consideration is being held in escrow to indemnify us against and reimburse us for certain events and cover certain liabilities and transaction costs 
unused consideration will be released from escrow at certain times during and on october   we commenced an all cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of starbase for aggregate consideration of million and million in bridge financing that was forgiven upon the consummation of the transaction 
in the initial tender offer  which expired on november   we purchased of the outstanding starbase shares for million 
upon the completion of the initial tender  we began consolidating the operating results of starbase 
on january   we purchased the remaining shares outstanding for million 
we account for acquisitions as purchases in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
as such  we report all acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities of acquired companies at fair value 
our determination of the values of acquired intangibles was based on the discounted cash flow method 
we recognize the fair value of purchased identifiable intangibles as an operating expense over the estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible  unless the identifiable intangible is determined to have an indefinite life 
we recognize the fair value associated with in process technology as an operating expense during the period the transaction is consummated 
we value employee stock options assumed as part of acquisitions using the black scholes valuation model 
the value of all vested awards and the value of unvested awards in excess of the intrinsic value of the unvested awards are included as part of the purchase consideration 
we report the intrinsic value of the unvested awards as deferred compensation and record it as an operating expense over the remaining vesting period of the award 
we value our stock issued as part of the purchase consideration based upon the average of the closing price for the five day trading period surrounding the transaction 
we report total consideration in excess of the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets  net of assumed liabilities  as goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  or sfas  we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as well as when circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
impairment testing 
table of contents of goodwill is performed in two steps 
first  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step 
the second step of the impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter of based on a single reporting unit and concluded there was no impairment as of september  the market capitalization method was the primary method used to determine the fair values for sfas impairment purposes 
we did not record an impairment to goodwill during  or refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we may incur substantial liabilities in connection with our acquisitions that are accounted for as purchases 
these include the termination of employees  asserted claims or litigation  impairment of assets or termination of leases 
we have incurred such liabilities with certain acquisitions in the past including the acquisition of togethersoft in we estimate merger related costs at the time of the acquisition and accrue these costs  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  with an offsetting entry to goodwill 
these accruals involve estimates regarding future events  sometimes several years in the future 
we may make revisions and adjustments to the accrual and the related goodwill based on actual events 
restructuring we report costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activity in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
 sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  as applicable 
under sfas no 
 we record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required 
the definition of significant future services does not include any retention period up to days in connection with the employee earning the termination benefits 
we recognize the present value of facility lease termination obligations  net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs  when we have future payments with no future economic benefit or a commitment to pay the termination costs of a prior commitment 
in future periods we will record accretion expense to increase our liability to an amount equal to the estimated future cash payments necessary to exit the leases 
this requires a significant amount of judgment and management estimation in order to determine the expected time frame it will take to find a subtenant  the amount of sublease income to be received and the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future cash flows 
should actual lease exit costs differ from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring charge which would impact net income in the period such adjustment was recorded 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we have accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related 
table of contents interpretations 
under apb  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the closing market price of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted 
we recognized compensation cost for stock options  if any  ratably over the vesting period 
generally  we grant options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the grant date 
we granted restricted stock to certain employees in and compensation expense for restricted stock issued totaled million  million and thousand in  and  respectively 
we have provided additional pro forma disclosures as required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  or sfas r  which amends sfas and requires the measurement of all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased through employee stock purchase plans  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we adopted sfas r as of january  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition of stock based compensation expense 
in october  the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting for all unvested stock options granted prior to september  with an exercise price higher than the closing price of borland s common stock on november   which was per share 
unvested stock options held by members of the board of directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
approximately million unvested stock options became fully vested upon acceleration 
the primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable us to minimize recognizing future compensation expense associated with our outstanding options upon adoption of sfas r 
we estimate the aggregate expense that was eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options was approximately million  assuming no material change in employee retention behavior 
as of december   of our total outstanding stock options were unvested and the expense for these unvested stock options will be recorded in through and is estimated to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
because our near term  stock based compensation costs were reduced by the acceleration of vesting  our stock based compensation costs could grow significantly in future periods if we continue to grant amounts of new stock based compensation awards similar to recent periods 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our operating results and financial condition 
the pro forma information presented below and in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item presents the estimated compensation charges under sfas based on the value of unvested awards at december   we expect sfas r to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations following adoption as of january  compensation charges under sfas r will be affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 

table of contents pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share had we recorded compensation costs based on the estimated grant date fair value  as defined by sfas  for awards granted under our stock option and stock purchase plans  our pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share in  and would have been as follows amounts in thousands  expect per share data net income loss as reported stock compensation adjustment intrinsic value stock compensation expense  net of tax pro forma net income loss per share as reported basic as reported diluted pro forma basic pro forma diluted the pro forma amounts include compensation expenses related to stock option grants and stock purchase rights for  and in future years  the annual compensation expense will increase relative to the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted in those future years 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  expected life years years years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  allows participants to purchase shares at of the lower of the fair value of the common stock at the beginning of the offering period or the fair value on the purchase date 
there are two offering periods  a twelve month annual offering period that begins on or about december of each year and a six month half year offering period that generally begins on or about june of each year 
espp compensation cost included in pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts is recognized for the fair value of the employees purchase rights  which was estimated using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  expected life months months months risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  we evaluate the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived 
table of contents assets to be disposed 
sfas requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets if the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset for assets to be held and used  or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less cost to dispose for assets to be disposed 
fair market value is determined using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
no impairment was recorded in  or investments from time to time we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in the current carrying value of an investment  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in  we recorded a charge of million to write down our loan to appforge  which was subsequently recovered and recorded as a gain on investments in income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the weight of the available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
if our assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change  we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which we make the determination 
our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss amongst the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we record liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and to the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
we also record deferred tax liabilities for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the foreign earnings are not considered permanently reinvested 
contingencies our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation and demands  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will 
table of contents assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and demands  and revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation we have numerous foreign subsidiaries  which together accounted for of our total revenues in  and of our total assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in unrealized exchange gains and losses  which are included as a component of cumulative other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on the judgment of management and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures is considered the functional currency  however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations are also considered 
cumulative translation adjustments include any gain or loss associated with the translation of a subsidiary s financial statements when the functional currency of a subsidiary is the local currency 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar  any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized and recorded within our statement of operations in the period during which the disposal occurs 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation gains of million and million  which were included as part of cumulative other comprehensive income within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 
during  we recorded net foreign currency losses totaling million as part of other comprehensive income on the balance sheet  which included translation gains and losses associated with our foreign subsidiaries 
during and  we recorded net foreign currency gains totaling million and million  respectively 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar  these translation gains and losses would have been included in our results of operations for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar and the significance of the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
these currencies have included the japanese yen  the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  chinese yen  korean won  brazilian real  russian ruble  indian rupee  mexican peso and australian  new zealand  canadian  singapore and hong kong dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could differ significantly from those we have experienced in recent years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time or we sell or liquidate one of our subsidiaries  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are discussed under foreign currency risk in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address the foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts as described below 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the local currency of the country in which we have established business operations 
both revenues and operating expenses in each of these countries are in local currencies  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to fluctuations in local currencies against the us dollar 
however  our financial results could still be adversely affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  we have established a program to minimize our foreign currency exposure utilizing forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to short term inter company balances denominated in foreign currencies 
the goal of this program is to offset the translation effect of foreign currency denominated short term inter company balances by entering into contracts to buy or sell foreign currency at the time a foreign currency receivable or payable is generated 
at month end  foreign currency denominated balances and the forward exchange contracts are marked to market and unrealized gains and losses are included in interest and other income  net 
during  we recorded net realized foreign exchange losses of million  included as part of interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
the foreign exchange losses were generated due primarily to fluctuation in the euro  the united kingdom pound sterling  and the australian and singapore dollars versus the us dollar 
it is uncertain whether these currency trends will continue 
in the future we may experience foreign exchange losses on our inter company receivables and payables to the extent that we have not mitigated our exposure utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
during we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of million  in cumulative other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets  in part  due to foreign currency movements on our long term inter company balances 
as of december   we had million  million  million  million and million in long term inter company balances that will be settled in australian dollars  singapore dollars  japanese yen  brazilian reais and south korean won  respectively 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential financial effect of possible near term changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based upon our analysis  the effect of such rate changes is not expected to be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on our forward exchange contracts generally offset the related effect on the underlying inter company balances 

table of contents the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments  comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts as of december  the information is provided in us dollar equivalent amounts  as presented in our financial statements 
for foreign currency forward exchange contracts  the table below presents the notional amounts at the contract exchange rates  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and the net fair value for our forward contracts as of december  all forward contracts in the table below represent contracts to buy or sell the currencies listed 
all instruments mature within one month dollar amounts in thousands notional amount weighted average contract rate net fair value at december  foreign currency forward exchange contracts australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar czech koruna euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen new zealand dollar russian rouble singapore dollar united kingdom pound sterling total interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of financial instruments such as commercial paper  auction rate securities and certificates of deposit 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to million for any one commercial issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in securities rated at least a p as published by standard and poor s and moody s  and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer 
to ensure portfolio liquidity  our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary and resale markets 
cash and cash equivalents include investments  which have an original maturity of days or less and short term investments include investments which have an original maturity of days up to one year 
as of december  and december   we held no investments classified as long term 
at december   the weighted average interest rate we earned on our cash and cash equivalents balance of million was and the weighted average interest rate we earned on our short term investments balance of million was 
at december   the weighted average interest rate we earned on our cash and cash equivalents balance of million was and the weighted average interest rate we earned on our short term investments balance of million was 
the difference in the weighted average interest rates associated with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is due primarily to interest rates on auction rate securities which are included in our short term investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   it would not materially change the fair market value of our investment portfolio 

table of contents credit risks our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and trade receivables 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions and commercial paper 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
no single group or customer represented greater than of total accounts receivable  net of allowances  as of december   or
