overview radioshack is primarily a retailer of consumer electronics products and services 
we seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by focusing on dominating cost effective solutions to meet everyone s routine electronics needs and families distinct electronics wants 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence  knowledgeable sales staff  and relationships with reputable vendors 
we believe this strategy provides us with the opportunity to increase our market share in the highly competitive consumer electronics area 
furthermore  we believe that by focusing on opportunities such as innovative products  new markets  licensing opportunities and creative distribution channels  we can ultimately generate increased financial returns for our shareholders over the long term 
we have identified two key opportunities to drive company growth  which are in alignment with our overall strategy described above 
we are focusing on growth of our core business  which includes sales generated by our radioshack company operated stores  dealers and our web site www 
radioshack 
com  as well as businesses that we consider to be close to our core strengths  including our kiosk business  international operations and consumer electronics repairs 
with respect to our core business  our strategy is to enhance our brands and customer experiences through our stores  dealers and web site 
we are accomplishing this by focusing on improvement of our product assortment  store personnel and store environment 
in order to improve our product assortment  we are focusing on high performing product categories  while de emphasizing other product categories that have had lower historical performances 
in addition  we are attempting to identify technologies that we believe we can grow  based on our established ability to accelerate the adoption rate of new technologies 
with respect to store personnel  we have enhanced our training  compensation and store operating procedures  including our receiving and labor scheduling 
finally  we have improved our store environment by rolling out an updated store format to  stores through december  we intend to continue updating our stores in and beyond 
in addition  we make continuous enhancements to our store format as new stores are opened 
we are also focusing on businesses that are considered to be close to our core strengths 
this close to core strategy includes expanding our kiosk business  recognizing innovative product channels and opportunities  and identifying international expansion opportunities 
in order to identify innovative product channels and opportunities  we are focusing on creating innovative relationships with key parties such as vendors and product developers  utilizing new channels  and obtaining intellectual property and licensing rights to innovative products 
in  we significantly expanded our kiosk business by purchasing from a third party  the wireless kiosks in sam s club 
we pay rent for the use of the kiosk area within sam s club locations  while utilizing our employees  pos system  and store fixtures 
another component of our kiosk business is our sprint nextel kiosk locations in shopping malls 
at these locations  which we staff  we sell both sprint and nextel wireless handsets and related accessories 
we have a profit sharing and working capital arrangement with sprint nextel related to these locations 
we expect to continue to identify additional opportunities in our overall kiosk business in turnaround program overview on february   we announced a significant turnaround program with the following goals increase the average unit volume of our radioshack company operated store base  rationalize our cost structure  and grow profitable square feet in our store portfolio 
our turnaround program contains four key components that we believe will help to achieve these goals update our inventory  focus on our top performing radioshack company operated stores  while closing to radioshack company operated stores  and aggressively relocating other radioshack company operated stores  consolidate our distribution centers  and reduce our overhead costs 
we will replace old  slower moving merchandise with new  faster moving merchandise 
in connection with this replacement  during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we identified a significant amount of slow moving inventory for replacement 
we will continue to review our inventory to identify additional items for replacement 
ultimately  we anticipate that this inventory update will help us increase the average unit volume of our store base 
we will also concentrate our efforts and investment on improving top performing stores 
to do so  we anticipate that we will close from to of our radioshack company operated stores  which is expected to occur during and the first half of we are still in the process of identifying the locations and the exact timing of these closures 
during and  we will also specifically evaluate additional stores  on a case by case basis  to determine whether these stores meet our current criteria for closure 
the timing of the store closures may occur on an accelerated basis if appropriate termination agreements can be reached with the related lessors 
in addition  we will evaluate opportunities to accelerate the relocation of stores when we believe that a desirable opportunity is presented 
we expect to continue to expand our kiosk business during in addition  we intend to close our distribution centers in charleston  south carolina  and southaven  mississippi  in we will also aggressively review overhead expenses in to identify potential sources of cost reduction and to focus our resources in a manner that we believe will deliver our business plan 
we believe that closing the lower performing stores  consolidating our distribution centers and reviewing our overhead expenses  as described above  will rationalize our overall cost structure 
see financial impact of turnaround program below for a discussion of the expected financial impacts of our turnaround program 
key indicators of financial performance for management to identify our progress in achieving our solutions strategy  we use several key financial performance metrics  including metrics related to net sales and operating revenues  ticket analysis  gross margin  inventory  selling  general and administrative sg a expense  operating margin  and labor productivity 
net sales and operating revenues metrics as a retailer  we consider growth in revenue to be one of the key indicators of our overall financial performance 
we examine our revenue by using several key metrics  including overall change in net sales and operating revenues  comparable store sales growth  average tickets per store and average sales per ticket 
the change in net sales and operating revenue provides us with an overall indication of the demand for our products and services 
comparable store sales include the sales of any domestic retail location where we have a physical presence  including radioshack company operated stores and kiosks  that has full months of recorded sales 
the table below summarizes these revenue metrics for the periods indicated year ended december  consolidated net sales and operating revenues growth comparable store sales increase ticket analysis average tickets per store  in conjunction with average sales per ticket  provides us with an indication of whether the changes in revenues were generated by a higher or lower volume of sales or by sales of products with higher or lower prices 
the table below summarizes our average ticket analysis for radioshack company operated stores for the periods indicated year ended december  radioshack company operated stores average tickets per store per day average sales per ticket gross margin metrics we view our gross profit and gross margin as key metrics of our financial performance  as it indicates the extent to which we are able to manage our product costs and optimize product mix 
the table below summarizes gross profit and gross margin for the periods indicated year ended december  gross profit    gross margin operating income operating income from our two operating segments  as well as the other and unallocated categories  are as follows year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores kiosks other unallocated operating income operating income included in the unallocated category consists of overhead and corporate expenses that are not allocated to the separate reportable segments for management reporting purposes 
types of unallocated costs include corporate departmental expenses  such as labor and benefits  as well as advertising  insurance  distribution and information technology costs 
for more information regarding our operating segments  see note segment reporting to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory metrics we review inventory turnover and the cash conversion cycle to determine the productivity of our inventory purchases 
the table below summarizes inventory metrics for the periods indicated at december  inventory turnover times per year cash conversion cycle days sg a expense and operating margin metrics we believe that our ability to leverage our fixed expense base and  accordingly  increase operating margin is an important indicator of our financial performance and process efficiency 
the table below summarizes these metrics for the periods indicated year ended december  sg a expense as a percentage of sales operating margin labor productivity metrics we review radioshack company operated store sales per labor hour  which provides us with information regarding our in store labor productivity with respect to sales 
the table below summarizes radioshack company operated store sales per labor hour year ended december  radioshack company operated store sales per labor hour in conjunction with our goals to improve our customers experiences  as well as overall in store productivity  we have implemented consistent operating procedures in all of our radioshack company operated stores 
we completed this implementation in and are now monitoring compliance with these procedures 
at december   fewer than stores utilized these procedures

radioshack company operated stores    kiosks dealer and other outlets n a    total number of retail locations    in and  we closed a total of radioshack company operated stores  net of new store openings and relocations  due to our decision not to renew leases on locations that fail to meet our financial return goals 
it is anticipated that the number of radioshack company operated stores will decline by approximately to stores through the first half of  as we implement our turnaround strategy 
see turnaround program overview included in md a above 
sam s club has the unconditional right to assume the operation of up to kiosk locations in total 
they assumed operation of kiosk locations during the first quarter of and in the fourth quarter of that were previously operated by us 
we expect the number of kiosks to increase by approximately during  driven by additional sprint nextel kiosk locations 
in and  we closed over dealer outlets  net of new outlet openings or conversion to radioshack company operated stores 
this trend is due to the closure of smaller outlets 
additionally  we had canadian company operated stores at december  it is anticipated that the number of dealer and international outlets in will not change materially from results of operations net sales and operating revenues sales increased to  million in from  million in we had a increase in comparable store sales 
these increases were primarily the result of a increase in our wireless platform sales and a increase in our personal electronics platform sales 
a net addition of kiosk locations contributed to our overall sales increase 
kiosks were the primary driver of the wireless platform sales increase 
consolidated net sales and operating revenues by our two operating segments and other sales are as follows year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores    kiosks other sales consolidated net sales and operating revenues   the following table provides a summary of our consolidated net sales and operating revenues by platform and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
these consolidated platform sales include sales from our radioshack company operated stores and kiosks  as well as other sales 
consolidated net sales and operating revenues year ended december  in millions wireless    accessory    personal electronics modern home power service technical service centers and other sales consolidated net sales and operating revenues   service centers and other sales include our outside sales from our service centers  in addition to radioshack company operated store repair revenue and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and domestic and overseas manufacturing facilities 
compared with radioshack company operated stores radioshack net sales and operating revenues year ended december  in millions wireless    accessory personal electronics modern home power service technical other revenue net sales and operating revenues    sales in our wireless platform includes wireless handsets and communication devices such as scanners and two way radios decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily driven by our wireless carrier transition and a significant decline in the growth rate of industry gross subscriber additions 
sales in our accessory platform includes accessories for home entertainment products  wireless handsets  digital imaging products and computers increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these increases were primarily the result of higher sales of igo power adapters  digital music accessories and media storage  which were partially offset by a decline in home entertainment and wireless accessory sales 
sales in our personal electronics platform includes digital cameras  camcorders  toys  wellness products  digital music players and satellite radios increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these sales increases were driven primarily by increased sales of satellite radios including income from warrants earned  digital music players  and digital imaging products 
sales in our modern home platform includes residential telephones  home audio and video end products  direct to home dth satellite systems  and computers decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these decreases were primarily due to sales decreases in dth satellite systems  cordless telephones and desktop computers  which were partially offset by increased portable dvd player  video projector  and home network product sales 
sales in our power platform includes general and special purpose batteries and battery chargers decreased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to the sales decrease was primarily due to a decrease in special purpose battery sales 
sales in our service platform includes prepaid wireless airtime  bill payment revenue and extended service plans increased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to these increases were primarily due to an increase in sales of prepaid wireless airtime 
sales in our technical platform includes wire and cable  connectivity products  components and tools  as well as hobby and robotic products increased slightly in dollars and remained the same as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to the dollar increase was primarily due to higher sales of tools and robotic kits 
other revenue includes radioshack company operated store repair revenue and other revenue decreased slightly in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues 
kiosks kiosk sales increased million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
this increase was the result of an increased number of kiosk locations over kiosk sales consist primarily of wireless platform sales and related accessory platform sales 
we anticipate kiosk sales for each platform will increase for  as we continue to expand our kiosk business 
other sales other sales include sales to our independent dealers  outside sales from our service centers  sales generated by our www 
radioshack 
com web site  sales to our mexico joint venture  sales to commercial customers  and outside sales of our global sourcing operations and manufacturing facilities 
these sales were up million for  or an increase of  when compared to this sales increase was primarily due to increased sales to dealers over  in addition to e commerce and service centers sales increases 
consolidated gross profit gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a decrease in gross profit and a percentage point decrease in our gross profit percentage 
these decreases were partially the result of write downs in the second half of as a result of our inventory obsolescence reviews  in which we identified a significant amount of slow moving inventory for rationalization 
a mix change toward our lower gross margin kiosk channel also contributed to the overall decrease in our gross margin rate 
additionally  our merchandise mix among platforms shifted due to significant growth in the sale of digital music players and digital imaging products  as well as prepaid airtime refills  within the lower gross margin personal electronics platform and the service platform  respectively 
we expect that gross profit in will continue to be influenced by an ongoing shift in our merchandise mix to lower margin products  as well as by higher sales from lower margin sales channels 
in addition  we anticipate that our gross margins will be adversely affected by our on going efforts to update our inventory under our turnaround program

we expect an increase of approximately million in related to the expensing of equity based awards pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in addition  we expect that our turnaround program will have an additional impact on our anticipated payroll expense  as discussed in financial impact of turnaround program below 
rent expense increased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
this increase was due primarily to the full year effect of the acquisition of the sam s club kiosk business and the sprint nextel kiosk expansion

we also expect that our turnaround program will have an additional impact on our anticipated rent expense  as discussed in financial impact of turnaround program below 
advertising expense decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues 
this decrease was primarily due to an increase in contributions from our vendors 
additionally  the decrease related to a change in creative strategy 
we expect our advertising expense to decrease in insurance expense decreased in both dollars and as a percent of net sales and operating revenues as a result of our mid year change to a larger health claim provider  which allowed us greater discounts 
our insurance expense relates to losses  claims and insurance premiums  which are partially offset by contributions from health insurance participants

consolidated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million and increased to of net sales and operating revenues  compared to for the increase in depreciation was primarily attributable to our new corporate headquarters  which is now complete and occupied  increased spending for our store remodel program  information system projects  and the amortization of intangibles related to our sam s club kiosk business 
we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase approximately in due to increased spending for our store remodel program and information system projects 
in addition  we expect that our turnaround program will affect our anticipated depreciation and amortization expense  as discussed in financial impact of turnaround program below 
the table below gives a summary of our depreciation and amortization expense by segment 
year ended december  in millions radioshack company operated stores kiosks other unallocated consolidated depreciation and amortization consolidated net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  an increase of million or 
interest expense increased approximately to million in from million in this increase primarily resulted from the elimination of capitalized interest expense due to the completion of the construction of our new corporate headquarters 
additionally  interest expense increased due to interest rate swap agreements and an increase in the average debt outstanding in interest income decreased approximately to million in from million in  despite an increase in investment rates 
this was primarily the result of a lower average investment balance 
interest expense  net of interest income  in is expected to be slightly more than net interest expense in consolidated other income  net during the first quarter of  we sold all rights  title and interest to the tandy name within australia and new zealand to an affiliate of dick smith electronics  an australia based consumer electronics retailer 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of million in other income 
during the year ended december   we received no payments and recorded no income under our tax sharing agreement with o sullivan industries holdings  inc o sullivan  compared to million received and recorded in future payments under the tax sharing agreement will vary based on the level of o sullivan s future earnings and are also dependent on o sullivan s overall financial condition and ability to pay 
o sullivan filed a voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy protection on october   in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia in atlanta  which could have an adverse effect on our right to receive future payments under the tax sharing agreement 
we cannot give any assurances as to the amount or frequency of payment  if any  that we may receive from o sullivan in future periods 
consolidated provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of for and for the decrease in was primarily due to a favorable non cash income tax benefit of million related to the release of a tax contingency reserve 
this reserve was related to losses sustained in connection with our european operations  which were fully dissolved by the release of the reserve occurred in the third quarter because the statute of limitations governing these issues expired on september  we anticipate that the effective tax rate for will be approximately 
the american jobs creation act of the act provided a temporary elective incentive to repatriate foreign earnings by providing a deduction equal to of the dividends received  which reduced the effective federal income tax rate on these earnings from to 
we repatriated million of foreign earnings during as we have not previously had any amounts reflected in our financial statements as earnings permanently invested outside the united states  a total tax benefit of million was recognized related to the repatriation 
compared with the discussion comparing to relates to our consolidated results and does not include segment allocations  because the impact on our financial results was immaterial in both years 
net sales and operating revenues sales increased to  million in from  million in we had a increase in comparable company store sales

gross profit gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a increase in gross profit and a basis point increase in our gross profit percentage 
these increases over the prior year were primarily due to significantly less margin erosion from price markdowns  we sold over less in discontinued and devalued merchandise in versus the prior year 
in addition  the benefits of centralized procurement and better vendor management enabled us to sell like products year over year at higher gross margins 
these increases were partially offset by a change in merchandise mix among platforms  resulting in increased sales of lower margin products  notably wireless  and decreased sales of higher margin products like accessories

additionally  retrospective application is not required when explicit transition requirements specific to newly adopted accounting principles exist 
retrospective application requires the cumulative effect of the change on periods prior to those presented to be reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the first period presented and the offsetting adjustments to be recorded to opening retained earnings

retains the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
for reporting both the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate

r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no

prior to sfas no

in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment 
this sab provides views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  and is intended to assist in the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january   utilizing the modified prospective transition method  which requires that we recognize compensation expense for all new and unvested share based payment awards from this effective date 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in an increase in compensation expense of approximately million for the year ending december  furthermore  as a result of our evaluation of the guidance provided within sfas no 
r and sab no 
 we have refined our methodologies used to estimate expected volatility and expected term upon our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the expected volatility assumption will be determined utilizing a combination of historical and implied volatility  and the refined expected term methodology is anticipated to result in a shorter expected term than historically utilized in our pro forma disclosures

sfas no 
requires that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies terminology within sfas no 
and requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
we are often legally obligated to remove leasehold improvements and fixtures whenever we vacate a leased premise  although the date or method of settlement may not be known 
based on our ability to reasonably estimate the settlement date  method of settlement  and associated probabilities  we believe we have sufficient information to apply an expected present value technique in order to estimate the fair value of our obligation to remove these assets from the leased premises 
fin no 
became effective for fiscal years ending after december   therefore  we adopted this interpretation during the fourth quarter of as a result  we recognized a one time after tax  non cash charge of million  which is reflected in the year ended december   as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
this charge represents the difference between the asset retirement obligation and capitalized asset retirement costs recognized in our december   consolidated balance sheet 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
this guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes lease renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
this guidance is effective for interim reporting periods beginning after june   and is applicable only to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after the effective date 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not materially impact our financial condition or results of operations during the year ended december  cash flow and liquidity a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities is outlined in the table below 
year ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities for a discussion of the expected effect of our turnaround program on cash flow and liquidity  see financial impact of turnaround program below 
cash flow operating activities cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
cash provided by net income plus non cash adjustments to net income was million in compared to million in this reduction was due to a decline in operating profits in  compared to the prior year 
cash generated by changes in working capital components was million in  compared to million of cash used in cash flow investing activities cash provided by investing activities in was million  compared to a cash usage of million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures for  and were related primarily to retail stores  information systems projects  and construction of our new corporate campus  although campus costs for were much lower than the preceding two years 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will be million to million 
radioshack company operated store remodels and relocations  continued expansion of our kiosk business and updated information systems will account for the majority of our anticipated capital expenditures 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
these cash and cash equivalents  along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenues and  when necessary  from our credit facilities  are available to fund future capital expenditure needs 
in addition  we received million in net proceeds from the sale and leaseback of our corporate campus during the fourth quarter of cash flow financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock in  and million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in repurchases was the result of the overnight share repurchase program osr 
see share repurchases below for a discussion of share repurchase programs and employee stock programs  as well as the osr 
the  and stock repurchases were partially funded by million  million and million  respectively  received from the sale of treasury stock to employee benefit plans and from stock option exercises 
the balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations 
additionally  our net borrowings decreased million in  compared to a decrease of million in and a slight increase in dividends paid in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
this decrease in dividends paid over the last three years was affected by yearly share repurchases  resulting in fewer shares outstanding 
free cash flow our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  million in and million in the increase in free cash flow in compared to was the result of cash provided by working capital components  primarily inventory  as well as a decrease in capital expenditures relating to the construction of our new corporate campus 
the decrease in free cash flow in compared to was the result of cash used by working capital components  primarily inventory 
we expect free cash flow to be approximately million to million in we believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which were million in  million in and million in we do not intend the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow capital structure and financial condition we consider our financial structure and condition to be sound 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  borrowings are available under our commercial paper program  which is backed by our million bank credit facilities 
furthermore  we can utilize these facilities in the event the commercial paper market becomes unavailable to us 
the availability of the commercial paper market to us is heavily dependent on our commercial paper debt ratings  see debt ratings below 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding and had not utilized our credit facilities 
for a discussion of the expected effect of our turnaround program on capital structure and financial condition  see financial impact of turnaround program below 
debt obligations debt ratings our debt is considered investment grade by the rating agencies 
below are the agencies ratings by category  as well as their respective current outlook for the ratings  as of march  category standard and poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt commercial paper outlook bbb a stable baa p negative bbb f negative in august  after reviewing the impact of the capital structure modification described below  s p  moody s and fitch rating agencies reaffirmed our existing short term credit ratings of a  p and f  respectively  and changed our long term ratings to bbb with a stable outlook  baa with a negative outlook  and bbb with negative outlook  respectively 
on november   fitch announced that  in connection with its quarterly review of our company  it was changing our long term rating to bbb with a stable outlook 
fitch affirmed our short term rating of f subsequent to december   fitch changed its long term rating outlook to negative 
in addition  moody s placed our ratings under review for a possible downgrade 
both of these actions followed our announcement of calendar earnings  our turnaround program  and other factors 
moody s concluded this review of our ratings on march   and reaffirmed our existing short term rating of p  but lowered our long term rating to baa with a negative outlook 
factors that can impact our future credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  the economic environment  conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
if further downgrades were to occur  it could adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs  access to capital markets including the commercial paper market  vendor financing terms and future new store occupancy costs 
our senior unsecured debt primarily consists of two issuances of year long term notes and an issuance of medium term notes 
long term notes we have a million debt shelf registration statement which became effective in august in august  we issued million of year unsecured long term notes under this shelf registration 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on september and march of each year 
these notes are due september  on may   we issued million of year notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who  in turn  offered the notes to qualified institutional buyers under sec rule a 
the annual interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on november and may of each year 
the notes mature on may  in august  under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the sec  we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes 
the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued  and substantially all of the notes became registered with the sec 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an underlying notional amount of million and a maturity in september in june and august  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of million and million  respectively  and both with maturities in may these swaps effectively convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
we entered into these agreements to balance our fixed versus floating rate debt portfolio to continue to take advantage of lower short term interest rates 
under these agreements  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of libor plus a markup and to receive a fixed rate of for the swap entered into in and for the swaps entered into in we have designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments 
we recorded an amount in other assets  net  of million and million their fair value at december  and  respectively  for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount 
fair value was computed based on the market s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity 
medium term notes we also issued  in various amounts and on various dates from december through september  medium term notes totaling million under the shelf registration described above 
at december   million of these notes remained outstanding 
the interest rate at december   for the outstanding million in medium term notes was 
these notes have a maturity in january as of december   there was no availability under this shelf registration 
available financing commercial paper currently  we have access to short term debt instruments  such as commercial paper issuances  available to supplement our short term financing needs 
the commercial paper program  when utilized  has a typical maturity of days or less 
the amount of commercial paper that can be outstanding is limited to a maximum of the unused portion of our million revolving credit facilities described in more detail below 
as of march   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
credit facilities on august   we added a million short term credit facility maturing on december   and a million day revolving credit facility maturing in august in the second quarter of  we replaced our existing million day revolving credit facility with a new five year credit facility maturing in june the terms of these credit facilities are substantially similar to our previously existing credit facilities 
these credit facilities are in addition to our existing million five year credit facility  which expires in june on december   we reduced our credit facilities to million  after receiving the proceeds from the sale leaseback of our corporate campus 
both million facilities remain in place  and the million facility expiring in august was reduced to million 
these credit facilities support our commercial paper program and gave us million in commercial paper availability at december   which also provides us a source of liquidity if for any reason the commercial paper market is unavailable 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities 
our outstanding debt and bank syndicated credit facilities have customary covenants  and we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines and long term debt in place 
however  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline  or we could not control operating costs  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
dividends we have paid common stock cash dividends for years 
on september   our board of directors declared an annual dividend of per share 
the dividend was paid on december   to shareholders of record on december  the dividend payment of million was funded from cash on hand 
operating leases we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations  two distribution centers  and our corporate campus  to lower our capital requirements 
share repurchases on february   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with no expiration date authorizing management to repurchase up to million in open market purchases 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million for the year ended december   under our approved repurchase programs but excluding the osr 
the funding required for these repurchases came from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents 
we also repurchase shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to our employee benefit plans 
as of march   there was million available under the million share repurchase program 
management suspended purchases under the million share repurchase program while the financial institution completed the osr described below 
as of march   management has not resumed share repurchases under the million program 
on august   we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase million shares of our common stock from the financial institution under the osr 
the share price upon completion of the transaction was 
we funded this payment from available cash on hand and short term borrowings in the commercial paper market 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additionally  borrowings are available under our commercial paper program  which is backed by our million bank credit facilities and can be utilized in the event the commercial paper market becomes unavailable to us 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding  and we had not utilized any portion of our credit facility 
construction and sale and leaseback of corporate headquarters we began construction of our new corporate headquarters in  which we partially occupied during the fourth quarter of our total campus construction and land costs were million  we completed construction in the first quarter of on december   we entered into a transaction in which we sold and leased back the buildings and certain of the property at our corporate headquarters  located in downtown fort worth  texas 
in connection with this transaction  we entered into a year triple net lease agreement in which we pay all operating expenses  with four five year options to renew 
we have retained ownership of other real estate adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
this transaction allowed us to repay approximately million of short term borrowings in the commercial paper market issued in conjunction with the osr and to reduce our credit facilities to million as described above 
capitalization the following table sets forth information about our capitalization on the dates indicated 
december  dollars in millions dollars of total capitalization dollars of total capitalization current debt long term debt total debt stockholders equity total capitalization   our debt to total capitalization ratio increased in from  due primarily to a million decrease in equity from  primarily resulting from the osr 
long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization also increased in due to the same decrease in equity from contractual and credit commitments the following tables  as well as the information contained in note indebtedness and borrowing facilities to our notes to consolidated financial statements  provide a summary of our various contractual commitments  debt and interest repayment requirements  and available credit lines 
the table below contains our known contractual commitments as of december in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years over years long term debt obligations interest obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations  purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total  purchase obligations include our product commitments  marketing agreements and freight commitments 
for more information regarding long term debt and lease commitments  refer to notes and  respectively  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below contains our credit commitments from various financial institutions 
in millions commitment expiration per period credit commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years lines of credit stand by letters of credit total commercial commitments we have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these contingent liabilities relate to various lease obligations arising from leases that were assigned to compusa  inc compusa as part of the sale of our computer city  inc subsidiary to compusa in august in the event compusa or the other assignees  as applicable  are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
our rent exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments assuming no projected sublease income is approximately million 
however  we have no reason to believe that compusa or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases or that we would be unable to sublet the properties  consequently  we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements from any fulfillment of these contingencies 
financial impact of turnaround program as discussed above  our turnaround program contains four key components update our inventory  focus on our top performing radioshack company operated stores  while closing to radioshack company operated stores and aggressively relocating other radioshack company operated stores  consolidate our distribution centers  and reduce our overhead costs 
inventory update in connection with updating our inventory  we identified a significant amount of slow moving inventory for rationalization  which  in addition to our normal inventory process  resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of we will continue to review our inventory composition  and we expect that we will incur additional charges of approximately million to million during these charges  if incurred  would increase our cost of products sold and adversely impact our margins accordingly 
store closures we plan to close approximately to radioshack company operated stores in the united states during and the first half of we expect the costs of these closures will total approximately million to million  consisting of million to million of lease termination costs  million to million of asset write offs  million to million of inventory dispositions  and million to million of severance related costs 
losses on inventory dispositions will be presented in our financial statements as a charge in cost of products sold 
we expect that the closures will result in a net positive future cash flow 
distribution center consolidations in connection with our consolidation of our distribution centers expected to occur during  we anticipate the charges excluding any gains from the sale or other disposition of assets will total approximately million  consisting of million of asset write offs  million of moving expenses  million of lease exit costs  and million of severance related costs 
we expect that the consolidations will result in a net positive future cash flow 
overhead cost reductions during the first half of  we will review our cost structure to identify potential sources of cost reductions 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the expected costs or cash flows associated with these anticipated reductions 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation with the exception of recent increases in energy costs  inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future  unless international events substantially affect the global economy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation under the cost method  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  and valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and third party branded products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider pays us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of a reserve for estimated service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider  while the residual revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
estimated product refunds and returns  service plan deactivations  residual revenue and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
if actual results differ from these estimates due to various factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  inventory valuation our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost or expected sales price ie  market value 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated external and internal freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs required to transport the merchandise from the vendor to the point of sale 
typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value is determined to be less than the recorded cost  a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date  and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that may arise above the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on information provided by either an independent actuarial firm or third party 
the information includes historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxes 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
as part of our evaluation of these tax issues  we establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
during the third quarter of  we recognized a non cash tax benefit of million resulting from the release of a tax contingency reserve pertaining to losses sustained in connection with our dissolved european operations 
additionally  we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
a reserve has been established based on our best estimates of the potential liability in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
although we believe that our tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting expected cash flows using our risk free rate of interest 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new carrying value of the asset 
the impairment calculation requires us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and discount rates 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges which could be material to our results of operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangibles related to business acquisitions that have occurred during prior years 
the original valuation of these intangibles is typically performed by a third party appraiser and may include the use of estimates that we provide concerning future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
we review our goodwill and intangible balances on an annual basis  typically near our fiscal year end  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or intangibles might exceed their current fair value 
the determination of fair value is based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and other comparable market analyses 
these valuation techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
if actual results or performance of certain business units are different from our estimates  we may be exposed to an impairment charge related to our goodwill or intangibles 
the total value of our goodwill and intangibles at december   was million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in md a and in other parts of this report include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks  were the interest rate swaps noted in our md a and warrants we earned to acquire common stock of sirius satellite radio inc sirius 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net indebtedness at december   of million  consisting of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of our interest rate swaps  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in an increase in annual net interest expense of million 
this assumption assumes no change in the net principal balance 
our exposure to market risk  specifically the equity markets  relates to warrants we earned as of december   to purchase million shares of sirius stock at an exercise price of per share 
we recorded these warrants as an asset at year end totaling million 
for every decline in value of shares of sirius stock by  we would be exposed to a million adjustment up to a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value on our balance sheet 
we also manage our portfolio of fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to long term interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase million and decrease million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase by million and million  respectively 
regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements
