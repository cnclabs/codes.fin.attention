item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview huttig is a distributor of building materials used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement  remodeling  and repair work 
we distribute our products through distribution centers serving states and sell primarily to building materials dealers  national buying groups  home centers and industrial users  including makers of manufactured homes 
as part of our expansion strategy and national focus  on january   we complete the acquisition of texas wholesale building materials of dallas  texas 
accordingly  the results of the dallas branch were included in our consolidated results for in addition  we opened a new branch in minneapolis  minnesota in the first quarter of and a new branch in long island  new york in the second quarter of in the third quarter of  we opened a new branch in atlanta  georgia 
industry conditions various factors historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
these factors include levels of construction  home improvement and remodeling activity  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates  competitive pressures  availability of credit and other local  regional and economic conditions 
many of these factors are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
we anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
our first quarter and fourth quarter are generally adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which typically result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
because much of our overhead and expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
we believe we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success 
our future revenues  costs and profitability  however  are all likely to be influenced by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those in item a risk factors 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends as well as management forecasts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consist of amounts owed for orders shipped to customers and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
huttig s corporate management establishes an overall credit policy for sales to customers and is responsible for all credit decisions 
the reserve for bad debt is determined based on a number of factors including when customer accounts exceed days past due or sooner depending on the credit strength of the customer 
our credit policies  together with monitoring of customer balances  have resulted in average bad debt expense of less than of net sales during each of the last three years 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we review inventories on hand and record a provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical and expected sales 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the fair market value is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other long lived assets  including intangible and other tangible assets  for impairment when events and circumstances warrant such review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
contingencies we accrue expenses when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the expense 
contingencies for which we have made accruals include environmental  product liability and other legal matters 
based on management s assessment of the most recent information available  management currently does not expect any of these contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period and our financial condition could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances related to these matters 
we accrue an estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and make adjustments to the amounts accrued as circumstances change 
insurance we carry insurance policies on insurable risks with coverages and other terms that we believe are appropriate 
we generally have self insured retention limits and have obtained fully insured layers of coverage above such self insured retention limits 
accruals for self insurance losses are made based on our claims experience 
we accrue for these liabilities for existing and unreported claims when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and when we can estimate those costs 
supplier rebates we enter into agreements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels 
we record vendor rebates as a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased 
income taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
changes in our tax liability occurred in and may occur in the future as our assessment changes based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax benefits or liabilities attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates would be recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when we believe that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in operations and the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations net sales from continuing operations were  million in  which was million  or approximately  higher than our branch in dallas  which we acquired in january  and to a lesser extent  our new branches in atlanta  minneapolis  and long island accounted for over one half of the net sales increase in same branch sales increased by approximately in over  primarily as a result of increased volume of millwork and building products sales 
by product category  sales increased in millwork and building products compared to and remained relatively flat in wood products 
millwork sales increased in to million led by exterior and interior doors  windows and columns  which increases were partially offset by a decrease in moulding sales 
building product sales increased in to million led by connectors  decking and housewrap 
wood products remained relatively stable at million in compared to million in the prior year  with increased sales of engineered wood products offsetting decreased sales of other wood products 
by region  sales in the southeast  excluding the new dallas branch  and the west increased and  respectively  in as compared to sales in the northeast were flat and sales in the midwest decreased in as compared to gross margin increased approximately to million or of sales in as compared to million or of sales in gross margin as a percentage of sales in benefited from higher gross margins on exterior and interior doors  an improved product mix and higher vendor rebates  which was partially offset by lower gross margins on mouldings and lower gross margins at our new dallas branch 
the dallas branch has a higher mix of lower margin direct sales and decreased our gross margin as a percentage of sales by 
operating expenses increased million to approximately million or of sales in  compared to approximately million or of sales in dallas and the other new branches accounted for approximately million of this increase 
same branch personnel expenses increased approximately million reflecting higher wage and benefit costs  partially offset by reduced incentive compensation expense 
same branch non personnel expenses increased approximately million consisting of higher building and equipment rent  fuel  advertising  outside services  maintenance  travel costs  and property taxes 
with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimate total stock based compensation expense  which includes stock options and unvested stock awards to be recorded in  will be approximately million compared to recorded in in october  the company s leased facility in riviera beach  florida suffered significant damage as a result of hurricane wilma and is not expected to re open until late summer or early fall in we recorded a million loss in the fourth quarter due to damages to the riviera beach facility and its contents 
in  we expect to record an additional insurance recovery on the inventory at this facility once our insurance claim is settled 
the results for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of a facility of million 
in  we recognized a million gain on disposal of capital assets from the sale of facilities 
in both years  we moved into larger  leased facilities 
net interest expense was million in and in addition  during the third quarter of  we refinanced our previous credit agreement and recorded a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to this credit agreement 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income for the years ended december  and were approximately and  respectively 
the effective tax rate benefited from the favorable closure of multi year tax audits 
as a result of the foregoing factors  income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in discontinued operations results from discontinued operations in the year ended december  reflect sales of million by our builder resource one step branches and an after tax gain of million on the february  divestiture of the remaining three one step branches 
sales from discontinued operations in the year ended december  were million  operating profit was million  and net income was million 
discontinued operating results in included american pine products  our former mouldings manufacturer  and all of the builder resource branches  some of which were sold later in fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations net sales from continuing operations in were million  which was million  or  higher than same branch sales increased in over and sales in all product categories achieved double digit sales growth over the prior year 
millwork sales increased million  or  over the prior year to million  with interior and exterior doors up and  respectively 
sales of other millwork products  primarily mouldings  columns and stairs  increased 
sales of building products in increased million  or  to million  led by increases in siding  decking and railings  fasteners and connectors  flashing  insulation  and housewrap 
wood products sales increased million  or  in to million  with engineered wood product sales up 
excluding the impact of wood and steel inflation  which contributed approximately million to sales growth  primarily in the first nine months of  sales from continuing operations increased from to increases in sales were achieved despite the impact of four hurricanes  which slowed construction in the third and fourth quarters in in the southeast region 
by the end of  sales had begun rebounding in the affected regions and december sales were higher than the previous year 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in from million in gross margin as a percentage of sales increased basis points to in  including lifo last in  first out inventory expense of million  or  resulting from inflation in wood and steel prices as compared to lifo inventory income of million in higher commodity wood and steel prices contributed approximately million  or  to the total increase in gross profit margin over operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in compared to in operating expenses were million in  or million higher than personnel expense  which includes commissions  wages  benefits and bonuses  increased million in over  primarily associated with higher profitability and increased sales volume 
non personnel expense increased million  principally due to higher vehicle liability insurance reserves  outside service expenses  fuel costs  vehicle and machinery rent and maintenance  and supplies 
bad debt expense was million higher in than we recognized a million gain on disposal of capital assets during from the sale of facilities  as we moved into larger  leased facilities 
during  we recorded a million gain on the sale of two facilities 
net interest expense was million in  which was million less than the decrease reflects the reduction in our effective borrowing rate and average debt outstanding compared to  resulting from entering into a new credit facility as stated in liquidity and capital resources 
during  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to our previous credit facility  which we refinanced on september  as a result of the foregoing factors  pretax income from continuing operations increased by million to million in compared to million in income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in the rate in versus was due to closing audits of our federal and state tax returns related to the years to discontinued operations net sales from our discontinued operations of american pine products and builder resource branches were million in  compared with million in the decrease in sales was due to the sale of american pine products on august  and the sale of the builder resource branches in the kansas city area on august  operating income from our discontinued operations was million in compared with million in the profit improvement over came from american pine products  which benefited from million in additional sales and million of additional gross margin caused from wood price inflation in the sale of these branches approximated net book value with a recorded gain on sale of these branches of less than million 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures and any acquisitions that we may undertake 
our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters  which reflect the seasonal nature of our business 
the second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters  largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters 
we typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters 
we also maintain significant inventories to meet rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers 
at december  and  inventories constituted approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
we also closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and  to the extent possible  manage variable operating costs to minimize seasonal effects on our profitability 
operations 
cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects improved working capital as a percentage of sales compared to the year ended december  accounts receivable increased by million during compared to an increase of million a year ago 
days sales outstanding improved slightly by days to days at december  from days at december  based on annualized fourth quarter sales for the respective periods 
inventory increased during by million compared to an increase of million in the increase in inventory over was primarily to support higher sales volume as well as our new and expanded branches 
our inventory turns decreased to turns in from turns in accounts payable increased by million during compared to a million decrease in the year ago period 
cash used in discontinued operations during was million compared to million used by discontinued operations in investing 
cash used in investing activities of million for reflects million used for the acquisition of texas wholesale  and million of capital expenditures for normal  continuing operating activities 
the uses of cash in investing activities were partially offset by million of proceeds from the disposition of our remaining builder resource locations in alabama  tennessee  and kansas  million of proceeds from the sale of our manchester  new hampshire facility and million of proceeds from the sale of various other equipment 
cash provided by investing activities for reflects million in proceeds from the disposition of american pine products and our builder resource locations in the kansas city area and baltimore and million of proceeds from the sale of three facilities partially offset by cash used of million for normal capital expenditures for continuing operating activities 
as of december   the company has invested approximately million in a new enterprise resource planning system  of which  approximately million is related to software and consulting services financed directly by our vendor and considered non cash financing 
the balance of approximately million relates primarily to internal costs capitalized in developing this system 
financing 
cash used in financing activities of million for reflects million of net payments on our term and revolving credit facilities and million of payments for our capital lease obligations and other obligations  which were partially offset by million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
cash used in financing activities of million for reflects million of net payments on our term and revolving credit facilities  million of payments for our capital lease obligations  and million for debt issuance costs for our new credit agreement 
we have a credit agreement  which expires in september  which provides for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
the revolving credit facility may be increased  subject to certain conditions  including bank approval  to a maximum availability of million 
as of december   we had revolving credit borrowings of million  at a weighted average interest rate of and million outstanding on the term loan under the credit agreement 
the interest rate in the credit agreement on the term loan is variable 
however  we have an interest rate swap agreement  which will expire in september  which mirrors the term loan and provides a fixed rate of interest of plus an applicable borrowing spread of between and basis points above libor  depending on the ratio of senior debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined ebitda at the end of each quarter 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge interest rate risks related to our variable rate term loan and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
as of december   the effective interest rate on the term loan was 
compliance with the loan covenant in the credit agreement that is based on the amount of senior debt outstanding limits the amount available under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had approximately million of credit available under the revolving credit facility  in addition to the amount outstanding  based on the senior debt to ebitda covenant 
the term loan provides for quarterly principal payments of approximately million 
subject to certain exceptions  we are required to repay amounts outstanding under the credit agreement from the cash proceeds of asset dispositions  debt or equity securities issuances and insurance claims related to real estate 
we must also pay a commitment fee in the range of to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit commitment 
the entire unpaid balance under the credit agreement is due and payable on september   the maturity date of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum senior debt to ebitda ratio  a minimum asset coverage ratio  and minimum tangible net worth 
the credit agreement also contains restrictive covenants pertaining to the management and operations of huttig and its subsidiaries 
the covenants include  among others  limitations on indebtedness  guarantees  letters of credit  liens  investments  dividends  acquisitions and asset sales 
at december   we are in compliance with the credit agreement covenants 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by each of the company s operating subsidiaries  and is secured by i a pledge to the administrative agent of the capital stock of huttig s subsidiaries  and ii the grant of security interests and liens on substantially all of the consolidated assets of huttig and our subsidiaries  excluding  among other things  certain specified real estate assets 
at december   we had letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement totaling million  primarily for health and workers compensation insurance 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and funds available under our credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our currently anticipated short term and long term liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to funds available from operating cash flows and our bank credit facility as described above  we use operating leases as a principal off balance sheet technique 
operating leases are employed as an alternative to purchasing certain property  plant and equipment 
future rental commitments  extending through the year  under all non cancelable operating leases in effect at december  total million 
divestitures during  we sold our remaining builder resource one step branches  including certain assets of those branches  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and real property  for million in cash and reported an after tax gain of million 
the after tax gain is included in net income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  we used the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt and trade payables 
we reported these branches as discontinued operations and related assets were classified as held for sale effective december  acquisition during the first quarter of  we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  huttig texas limited partnership  completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of texas wholesale building materials for million in cash  million in guaranteed payments to the former majority owner and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the source of funds for the acquisition was our existing credit facility 
commitments and contingencies the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total beyond long term debt  including current portion capital lease obligations operating lease obligations guaranteed payments purchase obligations capital equipment total amounts represent the expected cash payments on our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt approximates book value because interest rates on nearly all of the outstanding borrowings are reset every to days 
on august   we sold to woodgrain millwork  inc substantially all of the assets  but excluding the land  buildings and building improvements  of american pine products  a mouldings manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon 
we also entered into a non exclusive supply agreement with woodgrain under which we have agreed to purchase mouldings  doors  windows  door frames and other millwork products from woodgrain for a period of five years at market prices 
for  we agreed to purchase a minimum of million of products 
thereafter  the supply agreement requires that we purchase a certain minimum unit volume of certain products from woodgrain and that woodgrain sell such products at competitive market prices 
the minimum volume requirements represent less than half of our current overall requirements for such products 
if woodgrain is unable to meet our needs  we believe such products are readily available from other suppliers 
if we do not meet the minimum purchase requirements in  we will have to pay a penalty of up to  in addition to the amounts listed  at december   we had committed to lease new semi tractors 
upon delivery of a semi tractor  we generally enter into an operating lease commitment for these semi tractors with terms of up to years and generally lease the semi tractors under full service leases 
we expect the annual commitment for all of these semi tractors to be approximately million for years after the last semi tractor is received 
amounts represent guaranteed payments related to the acquisition of texas wholesale building materials  inc on january  new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  we have adopted this standard effective january  and elected the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
stock based awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the statement of operations 
we believe the adoption of sfas no 
r will increase our operating expenses by approximately million  or per diluted share  for this estimate may materially change because it will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted  the market value of our common stock as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our stock price  volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax impact 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  we believe the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the accounting for stock based compensation disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
cautionary statement relevant to forward looking information for the purpose of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k and our annual report to shareholders contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including but not limited to statements regarding our belief that cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs  our belief that we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success  our expectation about the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our future results  our expectation that known contingencies  including risks relating to environmental and legal proceedings  will not have a material effect on our financial condition  or cash flow  the future impact of competition  our ability to maintain favorable terms with our suppliers and transition to alternative suppliers of building products  and the effects of slower economic activity on our results of operations  our liquidity and exposure to market risk  our expectation of an additional insurance recovery in on the inventory at our riviera beach facility  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense  and cyclical and seasonal trends 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  believe  estimate  project or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements present management s expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives regarding our future business and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on current projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments  and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk as it relates to effects of changes in interest rates 
we had debt outstanding at december  under our revolving credit facility of million and a term loan of million 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which will expire in september  which mirrors the amortization of the million term loan and provides a fixed rate of interest of plus the applicable borrowing spread of between and basis points above libor  depending on the ratio of senior debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined  at the end of each quarter 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge interest rate risks related to our variable rate term loan and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
all of our debt under our revolving credit facility accrues interest at a floating rate basis of between and basis points above libor 
if market interest rates for libor had been different by an average of for the year ended december   our interest expense and income before taxes would have changed by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
this analysis does not consider the effects of any change in the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
we are subject to periodic fluctuations in the price of wood and steel commodities 
profitability is influenced by these changes as prices change between the time we buy and sell the wood or steel 
in addition  to the extent changes in interest rates affect the housing and remodeling market  we would be affected by such changes
