item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including under the headings economic and other factors  areas of focus and review of business segments 
these sections and other parts of this report including this item a contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are those that address activities  events or developments that management intends  expects  projects  believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future 
they are based on management s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other relevant factors 
they are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward looking statements 
we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near and long term 
these forward looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form k  including  in particular  the factors discussed below 
risk factors our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers  which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 
the operating results of our segments are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns  demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing costs 
the operating results of our aerospace segment  which generated percent of our consolidated revenues in  are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions  including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production and or the retirement of older aircraft  global flying hours  and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates  as well as the level and mix of us government appropriations for defense and space programs as further discussed below 
the challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors  including aircraft fuel prices  labor issues  airline insolvencies  terrorism and safety concerns  and changes in regulations 
future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our aerospace aftermarket sales and margins 
the operating results of our automation and control solutions acs segment  which generated percent of our consolidated revenues in  are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction including retrofits and upgrades  capital spending on building and process automation  industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion  and material price inflation 
specialty materials operating results are impacted by global gross domestic product and capacity utilization for chemical  industrial  refining and petrochemical plants 
transportation systems operating results are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers  and consumer spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products 
because approximately percent of our sales are in europe  the relative strength of the european economy and exchange rate fluctuations impact our sales and margins 
raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 
the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products  particularly in our specialty materials benzene and natural gas and transportation systems steel and other metals segments 
our inability to offset material price inflation with pricing or productivity actions could adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions  quality standards  and applicable laws and regulations 
we also depend in limited instances on sole source suppliers 
our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to mitigate the consequences of their non performance 
the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters  pandemic health issues  terrorist actions  labor disputes or governmental actions 
our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts  which could  in turn  result in reduced sales and profits  contract penalties or terminations  and damage to customer relationships 
our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 
our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards 
accordingly  our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to i identify emerging technological trends in our target end markets  ii develop and maintain competitive products  iii enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  and iv develop  manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost effectively 
our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources 
these development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses  and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings 
in addition  the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate 
the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance or their obsolescence due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects 
protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts 
we own or are licensed under a large number of us and foreign patents and patent applications  trademarks and copyrights 
our intellectual property rights may be challenged  invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain  renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms 
in some non us countries  laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application  which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights 
any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property  subject us to judgments  penalties and significant litigation costs  and or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 
an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non us jurisdictions and is subject to the economic  political  regulatory and other risks of international operations 
our international operations  including us exports  comprise a growing proportion of our operating results and our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets  including developing markets such as china  india and the middle east 
as this trend continues  our exposure to the risks attendant to international operations also increases 
these risks include fluctuations in currency value  exchange control regulations  wage and price controls  employment regulations  foreign investment laws  import and trade restrictions including embargoes  and government instability 
the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product  marketing  pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses  as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins 
we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long lived assets 
at december   the net carrying value of long lived assets property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately billion 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we periodically assess our long lived assets to determine if they are impaired 
significant negative industry or economic trends  disruptions to our business  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets  divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in charges to goodwill and other asset impairments 
future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 
impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated net worth and our shareowners equity and increase our debt to total capitalization ratio  which could negatively impact our access to the public debt and equity markets 
a change in the level of us government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of aerospace s defense and space related product and services 
sales of our defense and space related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets  particularly the us defense budget 
sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the u 
s 
department of defense comprised approximately and percent of aerospace and total sales  respectively  for the year ended december  although us defense spending increased in and is expected to increase again in  we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included  increased or reduced as part of the and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by congress  or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations 
we also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and or the nature of war related activity on existing  follow on or replacement programs 
a shift in defense spending to programs in which we do not participate and or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations 
as a supplier of military and other equipment to the u 
s 
government  we are subject to unusual risks  such as the right of the us government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance 
in addition to normal business risks  companies like honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the us government are subject to unusual risks  including dependence on congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds  changes in governmental procurement legislations and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments  significant changes in contract scheduling  complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete  necessity for constant design improvements  intense competition for us government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development  difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work  and other factors characteristic of the industry 
changes are customary over the life of us government contracts  particularly development contracts  and generally result in adjustments of contract prices 
our contracts with the us government are subject to audits 
like many other government contractors  we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations 
we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future 
us government contracts are subject to termination by the government  either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract 
in the case of a termination for convenience  we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred  plus termination costs and a reasonable profit 
if a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government 
we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations 
if honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations including violations of certain environmental or export laws  it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings 
the us government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent  criminal or other egregious misconduct 
debarment generally does not exceed three years 
changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations 
safety and performance regulations including mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft  product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact aerospace sales  research and development expenditures  operating costs and profitability 
the demand for and cost of providing automation and control solutions products  services and solutions can be impacted by fire  security  safety  health care and energy efficiency standards and regulations 
specialty materials results of operations can be affected by environmental eg  government regulation of refrigerants  safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations  while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our transportation systems segment 
completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned 
we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non core businesses 
we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms  on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by i the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns  ii the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule and or to achieve synergies within the plan and timeframe  and or iii the inability to dispose of non core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected time frame 
we cannot predict the outcome of litigation matters  government proceedings and other contingencies with certainty 
we are subject to a number of lawsuits  investigations and disputes some of which involve substantial amounts claimed arising out of the conduct of our business  including matters relating to commercial transactions  government contracts  product liability  prior acquisitions and divestitures  employee benefits plans  and environmental  health and safety matters 
resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly  and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain 
moreover  our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments  changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements  and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements  or become subject to damage awards or settlements  that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
while we maintain insurance for certain risks  the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities 
it also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities 
the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows  liquidity and financial condition 
our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures 
we have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters  including past production of products containing toxic substances 
additional lawsuits  claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations  and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we incur  and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations and enforcement of policies  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites  or the imposition of new clean up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations
