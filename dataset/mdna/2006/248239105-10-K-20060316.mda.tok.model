executive overview we provide a broad array of solutions worldwide that enable pharmaceutical and other life science companies to strategically optimize their sales and marketing channels and clinical resources 
our plan is to continue to diversify and expand our solutions portfolio  customer base and geographic reach by leveraging our extensive knowledge of the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries and capitalizing upon our deep relationships in these industries 
our strategy continues to rely on both internal growth and acquisitions to meet to our growth objectives 
we have expanded both our portfolio of solutions and customer base and believe that this combination presents significant opportunity for future growth 
in january and september  we broadened and enhanced our service portfolio with our acquisitions of buzzeopdma  inc buzzeo and optas  inc optas  respectively 
the buzzeo acquisition expands our sample and compliance management solution offerings 
the optas acquisition enhances our portfolio of marketing solutions services by expanding our privacy safe relationship marketing solutions for patients and physicians 
we believe our recent acquisitions complement our existing business operations by enhancing our solutions portfolio  increasing our access to new customers and allowing deeper penetration into our current markets 
we have also committed to investing in key initiatives to help drive future growth 
our future growth is dependent on our ability to further penetrate the markets in which we operate and increase the adoption rate of our expanded portfolio of solutions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we evaluate our performance based upon a number of operating metrics 
chief among these metrics are revenues  operating profit  diluted net income per share  operating cash flow and days sales outstanding 
our goal is to execute our strategy to yield growth in revenues  operating profit and diluted net income per share 
in  we grew our revenue approximately but did not grow our operating profit and diluted net income per share 
as we have experienced strong revenue growth in recent years  we believe that we have outgrown our structure and have seen an increase in organizational costs throughout late in we appointed two new executive officers who are evaluating a business plan to grow revenues and to streamline our cost structure 
as part of our effort to realign the company to drive efficiency and support our growth objectives  we currently plan to identify approximately million of annualized cost savings during as a result  we expect to incur severance and other associated costs for these actions in we do not expect to fully realize the savings from these efforts in in  we expanded our revenue categories into sales solutions  marketing solutions and shipping 
these categories reflect how our service offerings have been marketed to and viewed by our customers 
they are not reflective of the way we manage our business 
our operating costs are not broken out for these categories on a global basis  as they are not viewed as necessary in the management of our global business 
based upon all of these factors  while these categories are useful in understanding our operating results  we have one reporting segment for disclosure purposes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the following is a summary of our revenue categories sales solutions revenue includes products and services of the traditional dendrite business 
all of these solutions and services are used by or provided to the sales force of our customers and sales management 
marketing solutions revenue includes our product and service offerings that are not geared toward the client sales force and primarily consists of offerings acquired in our business combinations over the past few years 
the primary components of marketing revenue include integrated marketing  data  consulting and clinical services 
shipping revenues are disclosed separately as they are pass through costs that bear little to no margin  and are required to be included in revenues and costs based upon emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
these billable shipping transactions are primarily related to our integrated marketing activities 
management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
enterprise wide disclosure information appearing in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  acquisitions and related accruals  impairments  income taxes and capitalized software 
revenue recognition the area of revenue recognition requires management s to make significant judgments and estimates 
aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  governs revenue recognition for arrangements that include software which is more than incidental to the arrangement 
under sop  if a sale of software includes services that are essential to the functionality of the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued software  then the software and essential services are to be accounted for using contract accounting as described in accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the determination of whether or not services are essential to the functionality of the software can differ from arrangement to arrangement and requires the use of significant judgment by management 
factors used in determining whether or not services are essential to the functionality may include whether or not physical changes are being made to the software s underlying source code  the complexity of software configuration services  the level of effort required to build interfaces  the overall relationship of the service fees to the license fees  the length of time expected to complete the services  and whether or not the services can be obtained by a customer from their internal resources or another third party vendor 
if services are not considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  sop generally allows companies to recognize revenue for software licenses upon delivery of the licenses  prior to configuration or implementation services  provided that the other requirements of the sop are met 
in management s judgment  our configuration and implementation services generally are essential to the functionality of our software 
therefore  we typically recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method as detailed in sop the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires us to use significant estimates in measuring the progress to completion for each project 
for our license fee and implementation service projects  we use the input measure of labor incurred as compared with total expected labor for the entire project 
the determination of total project labor requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
we review these estimates on a monthly basis 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which would impact the amount of revenue previously recognized  had better estimates been available at the time 
many of our arrangements include multiple deliverables 
in the absence of higher level specific authoritative guidance  we determine the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
specifically  we will consider a delivered item as a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered element  delivery or performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and is substantially within our control 
the determination of whether or not arrangements meet these criteria requires significant judgment on the part of the management 
if our arrangements did not meet the separation criteria of eitf  the timing of revenue recognition could be delayed 
accounting for acquisitions the accounting related to business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value and useful life of the assets acquired and the fair value of the liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
we typically analyze a number of factors such as valuation or appraisal reports when determining the estimates of fair value 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair values  useful lives  or both  would be required 
accounting for impairments we review long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
other than goodwill item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and indefinite lived intangibles  if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the recoverability of the long lived assets by estimating future undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the long lived asset 
if this estimate of future undiscounted cash flows demonstrates that recoverability is not probable  an impairment loss would be calculated and recognized based on the excess carrying value of the long lived asset over the long lived asset s fair value 
the estimate of the fair value and the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying long lived assets are based on significant judgments and assumptions 
we review capitalized software development costs and purchased capitalized software development costs for impairment at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product is greater than the net realizable value of that product 
in instances where the unamortized capitalized costs are greater than the net realizable value  we would record an impairment loss 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for the possibility of impairment on an annual basis as of october of each year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis  or when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we calculate and compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
we currently have only one reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill for our reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the carrying value of the goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss  not to exceed the carrying value in our consolidated statement of operations 
on an annual basis  or when we determine that the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we calculate and compare the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
if we deem the useful life to be no longer indefinite  after testing for impairment in accordance with the applicable rules stated above  we amortize the intangible asset over its remaining estimated useful life  following the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up and we would continue to review for impairment in the future on an annual basis 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  all of which require significant judgment 
we must believe it is more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset will be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of the loss item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued carryforwards  capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary 
accounting for capitalized software we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product to be sold should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs  which includes directs costs of developing the product  should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is considered to be reached when a product and program design has been completed or a working model of the software product has been completed 
our application engineering group reviews each project to determine when technological feasibility of a product is established 
mergers and acquisitions we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses that represent strategic enhancements to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  may involve the use of cash  equity and or debt instruments 
we have made the following acquisitions over the last three years optas on september   we completed the acquisition of optas 
based in woburn  massachusetts  optas provided privacy safe relationship marketing solutions for patients and physicians 
optas results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition

synavant on june   we completed our acquisition of synavant inc synavant 
synavant provided a broad range of knowledge based services to pharmaceutical and other life science companies around the world 
its global solutions included pharmaceutical crm applications  integrated marketing  server and database management  dedicated local help line support  training  telemarketing  sample management and product recall services 
synavant was headquartered in atlanta  georgia  and had offices in countries

synavant s results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price for synavant was approximately  including consideration paid for the common stock per share and approximately  of legal and professional fees incurred in connection with the transaction 
we have finalized the valuation of certain intangibles and our restructuring plan to eliminate certain former synavant positions and exit certain former synavant facilities due to redundancies and gained efficiencies 
we accrued approximately  at june   for liabilities associated with the cost of completing the restructuring plan 
the components of this accrued liability were approximately  of severance costs for former synavant positions being eliminated and approximately  of costs to exit former synavant facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the liabilities related to the restructuring plan by approximately  based on our revised estimate of the total cost 
the components of the reduction to the accrued liability were approximately  for lower expected severance costs for former synavant positions being eliminated and approximately for lower costs to exit certain former synavant facilities 
this reduction was recorded by an adjustment within goodwill 
during finalization of the purchase price allocation  we increased our restructuring accrual estimate by approximately  due to an adjustment of the total costs to exit certain former synavant facilities and recorded the corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the liability accrued for expenses incurred in exiting certain synavant facilities includes  assumptions related to sublease income which offsets future lease obligations 
the underlying subleases are not in place for all facilities and the future placement of subleases  including the timing and terms and conditions of subleases  could be different than the assumptions and impact future results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues operating costs expenses operating costs selling  general and administrative research and development facility and other charges amortization of acquired intangible assets total operating costs expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued years ended december  and revenues year ended december  of total of total increase increase revenues revenues services technology sales solutions marketing solutions shipping total revenues total revenues for the year ended december  increased compared with the year ended december  our international revenues were  or approximately of total revenues  and increased by over  due to our recent acquisitions and organic growth which was offset by a reduction in ongoing services and licenses fees in asia 
total revenues in the united states were  or approximately of total revenues  and increased by from the year ended december  the increase in revenues is primarily due to our current year acquisitions  a non recurring project at our largest customer  and increased services at our second largest customer which was partially offset by a reduction of work orders and ongoing services with our largest customer resulting from its cost containment initiatives 
we expect this trend with our largest customer to continue in the future as this customer continues to evaluate its spending on salesforce effectiveness and related services 
as a result  we currently expect less revenue from this customer in and beyond 
our current contract with this customer for us salesforce effectiveness and related services has been renewed through  subject to a right of the customer to reduce or modify certain services 
the customer is re evaluating all such us services for in a process in which we expect to participate

the growth in international integrated marketing included the additional revenues from our acquisitions as well as organic growth 
in the united states  marketing solutions increased by approximately compared with the year ended december   due to increases in integrated marketing revenues and the inclusion of marketing services from our acquisitions  which was partially offset by a decrease in our domestic clinical  data and consulting revenues

operating costs increased for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  this increase was due to additional costs from our acquisitions and a full year of costs related to our acquisitions  higher pass through postage costs and our overall increase in revenues

gross r d spending r d expenses plus additions to capitalized software development costs decreased from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  gross item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued r d decreased due to the deployment of resources to revenue generating projects and the savings related to our offshore initiative 
facility and other charges 
during the year ended december   we recorded  of facility related charges and a severance charge of  the facility charges consist of  related to vacating a new jersey facility and for additional facilities vacated in previous periods due to changes in current market conditions  as well as  related to the write off of leasehold improvements associated with the exit of our new jersey facility 
the  severance charge relates to the elimination of certain senior and mid level management positions 
no such charges were incurred in amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased compared with the year ended december  the decrease primarily reflects certain intangibles assets related to the software associates international sai and synavant acquisitions  which were fully amortized as of june   partially offset by additional amortization of intangibles related to the schwarzeck  buzzeo and optas acquisitions

we received insurance proceeds in the year ended december  related to the recovery of costs of certain losses 
non operating income expense  net year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease interest income  net other expense  net interest income  net 
interest income increased for the year ended december  due to higher average cash balances  higher interest rates in and investing surplus cash offset by interest expense related to capital leases 
other expense  net 
other expense decreased for the year ended december  due to decreased foreign exchange losses on intercompany loans 
provision for income taxes 
our estimated effective income tax rate increased to for the year ended december  compared to in prior year 
the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to international subsidiaries generating taxable losses for which we were unable to take a benefit  the distribution of profits among countries with higher tax rates  and a reduction in the utilization of federal and state credits for which we had previously generated 
these increases were partially offset as we determined it was more likely than not that some of our state and foreign deferred tax assets  which had previously been reserved for  would be utilized prior to expiration and accordingly  we released a valuation allowance reserve associated with these deferred tax assets 
at december  and  there were approximately  and  respectively  of undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely

provision for income taxes 
our estimated effective income tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in prior year 
the reduction in our effective tax rate resulted primarily from the decrease in the number of international subsidiaries generating taxable losses for which previously we could not take a benefit as well as the more favorable distribution of profits among countries with lower tax rates 
in addition  during we recognized a full valuation allowance on a net operating loss carryforward at one of our international subsidiaries in the amount of that increased the effective tax rate by approximately

we finance our business primarily through cash generated by operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we generated operating cash from our net income adjusted for changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects from acquisitions 
our accrued facility and other charges resulted in lower net income for the year ended december   however  these charges had approximate  negative impact on our operating cash flows for the year ended december  future payments of these accruals will continue to have a negative impact on future operating cash flows 
in addition  our operating cash flows were impacted by payments for income taxes and purchase accounting restructuring charges 
during the three months ended december   our accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased to  from days for the three months ended december   due to advance billings to customers in late december and delays in collections at year end 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   and includes payments for the optas  buzzeo and  uto brain acquisitions as well as additions to capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to purchase payments made related to the mdm  uto brain and schwarzeck acquisitions as well as increased purchases of property and equipment related to various facility moves 
as anticipated  purchases of property and equipment increased for the year ended december  versus the comparable prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to equipment related to our new hardware facility in new jersey  new corporate headquarters in new jersey and international facilities  as well as investing in our integrated support center automation process  integrated marketing machinery  and the higher overall capital spending associated with our larger combined company 
during  we expect capital spending in the range of approximately  to  primarily to support the company s infrastructure and productivity initiatives 
we review our capital expenditure program periodically and adjust it as required to meet current needs 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   and includes proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by payments related to capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by the repayments of long term debt and loans acquired in connection with the uto brain acquisition 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  may involve the use of cash  equity and or debt instruments 
we believe that available funds  anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability of our revolving line of credit will satisfy our current projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements  exclusive of cash required for possible future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  during the next twelve to eighteen months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels or that anticipated operational improvements will be achieved 
our ability to generate future cash flows depends on our future performance and financial results  which  to a certain extent  are subject to general conditions in or affecting the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry and to general economic  political  financial  competitive and regulatory factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations and commitments the june  line of credit agreement with jpmorgan chase  amended september   expired on july  on july   we entered into a replacement line of credit agreement the agreement  in the amount of  with jpmorgan chase bank that expires on june  the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
the agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants  including those related to a a maximum leverage ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter  b a minimum interest coverage ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter and c a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of any fiscal quarter 
the agreement also restricts our ability to create or assume liens  dispose of assets  consolidate or merge  extend credit  incur other indebtedness or pay cash dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and did not have any amounts outstanding under the agreement

sfas changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective applications to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless impracticable

in march  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas the interpretation 
the interpretation clarifies the manner in which uncertainties concerning the timing and the method of settlement of an asset retirement obligation should be accounted for 
in addition  the interpretation clarifies the circumstances under which fair value of an asset retirement obligation is considered subject to reasonable estimation 
the company adopted the interpretation for the fiscal year ended december  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

this statement supersedes accounting principles board apb  accounting for stock issued to employees which allowed companies to use the intrinsic method of valuing share based payment transactions and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value method as defined in sfas sfas r provides two alternatives for adoption a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which follows the approach in the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate prior periods to record compensation cost calculated under sfas no 
for the pro forma disclosure 
in addition  sfas r also requires that tax benefits received in excess of compensation cost be reclassified from operating cash flows to financing cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the company has adopted sfas r under the modified prospective method effective january  the effect of adoption of sfas r is currently estimated to be approximately million to million after tax for however  our actual equity based compensation expense in will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
factors that may affect future results set forth in this form k are certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
you are strongly urged to carefully consider the cautionary language and risks set forth below 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues historically  a limited number of our customers have contributed a significant percentage of our revenues 
we anticipate that our operating results in any given period will continue to depend significantly upon revenues from a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers which could include loss through mergers and acquisitions could have a materially adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we cannot make any assurances that we will retain our existing customers or attract new customers that would replace the revenue that could be lost if one or more of these customers failed to renew its agreement s with us 
a significant agreement with our largest customer covering us salesforce effectiveness services is scheduled to renew on january   subject to a right of the customer to terminate at renewal 
the customer is re evaluating all such us services for in a process in which we expect to participate 
we cannot assure you that the contract will renew for  that it will renew upon substantially similar terms or that it will cover substantially similar services as those currently provided to this customer 
our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry most of our solutions are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these changes include the significant and continuing consolidation of the pharmaceutical industry which may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  regulatory changes that permit the over the counter sale of formerly prescription only drugs  us and international governmental regulations mandating price controls  increasing food and drug administration activism  and competitive pressure on the pharmaceutical industry resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare and pharmaceuticals through managed care organizations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as our business depends  in large part  on the business conditions within this marketplace 
our customers may not successfully implement our products our customers often implement our products in stages and our products are often utilized by a large number of our customers personnel 
in the event that our customers have difficulties implementing our products and services or are not satisfied with the implementation or operation our products and services  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we have acquired  and in the future may acquire  businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions  including any future acquisitions  are and will be accompanied by substantial risks  including unexpected problems  liabilities  risks or costs associated with the acquired business  the effect of the acquisitions on our financial and strategic position  our inability to successfully integrate the acquired business  the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies  our inability to achieve expected cost and business synergies  the significant strain on our operating systems  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the impairment or loss of relationships with customers of the acquired business  the negative impact of the combination of different corporate cultures  the loss of key employees of the acquired company  regulatory or compliance issues existing in the acquired organization  undetected problems within the acquired organization  and the integration and maintenance of uniform  company wide standards  procedures and policies 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we expect that the consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  equity  debt or a combination of these 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing shareholders will experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
while to date we have had success integrating acquired entities into our operations  we cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate new businesses into our operations or achieve any expected cost synergies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued business and economic pressures on our major customers may cause a decrease in demand for our new products and services business and economic pressures on our major customers may result in budget constraints that directly impact their ability to purchase our new products and services offerings 
we cannot assure you that any decrease in demand caused by these pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
the lengthy sales and implementation cycles for sfe solutions make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a sales force effectiveness sfe solution generally entails an extended decision making process by our customers because of the strategic implications  substantial costs and significant commitment of resources associated with a customer s license or implementation of the solution 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management of our customers are often involved in the process and  in some instances  their board of directors may also be involved 
as a result  the decision making process typically takes nine to eighteen months  and in certain cases longer 
in addition  other factors  unrelated to our product and services  such as acquisitions  product delays  or other issues  may also significantly impact the timing and amounts of buying decisions 
accordingly  we cannot fully control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
prior sales and implementation cycles cannot be relied upon as any indication of future cycles 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six or more months before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force is customary 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate our total revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that could cause these fluctuations are the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  potential delays in recognizing revenue from license and other transactions  seasonal variations in operating results  including the increased seasonality associated with our international growth  and variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
in addition  we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed  canceled or not awarded  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenues 
we also may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than originally anticipated 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below our targeted goals or expectations 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter may be subject to fluctuation 
you should not rely on our period to period comparisons of our results of operations as indications of future performance 
our future quarterly results may from time to time not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could have a materially adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued an unfavorable government review of our income and payroll tax returns and changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results we are subject to income  payroll and indirect taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for these taxes  and in the ordinary course of our business there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly subjected to routine audits by various tax authorities 
any such audit may result in a determination that our tax obligations exceed the amounts provided for by us in our financial statements 
such additional tax obligations and any related penalties could adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition for current  future and prior periods 
additionally  for a variety of reasons  we may not in the future be able to successfully maintain our historic effective tax rates 
future restructuring may adversely impact our operations we have announced plans to identify and reduce costs in our business 
as a result  we expect to incur severance and other associated costs for these actions which may adversely affect our future operating results 
furthermore  delays or increased costs in implementing any restructuring plans or cost savings initiatives or opportunities could delay or adversely affect the anticipated financial benefits of any such restructuring 
additionally  any restructuring or cost savings initiatives may be disruptive to our employees who are transitioning to different roles or responsibilities in restructured areas of our business 
such disruptions may cumulatively adversely impact future operating results 
there also can be no assurance that such savings initiatives or opportunities will be achieved in the time periods or amounts planned 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for sfe products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands continued to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our resources on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
software errors or defects could affect our revenues our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures or errors when products are first introduced or when updated versions are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from significant errors 
software errors could cause delays in the commercial release of products until the errors have been corrected 
software errors may cause us to be in breach of our agreements with customers  which could result in termination of the agreements and monetary damages 
software errors may cause damage to our reputation and cause us to commit significant resources to their correction 
errors that result in termination of agreements  monetary damages  losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services solutions there are a number of other companies that sell crm and sfe products and related services that specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including competitors that are actively selling crm and sfe software products in more than one country and competitors that also offer crm and sfe support services 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and have significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
while we believe that the crm and sfe software products and or services offered by most of our competitors do not address the variety of pharmaceutical customer needs that our solutions address  increased competition may require us to reduce the prices for our products and services 
increased competition may also result in decreased demand for our products and services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing crm and sfe products or support services  alliances among existing competitors  technological changes or changes in the our customers use of the internet  expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and development and or operation of in house crm or sfe software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
any one of these factors can lead to price reductions and or decreased demand and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market nor can we provide assurances that the demand for internet related products and services will increase the success of parts of our business will depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing internet related products  modifying and improving our existing products and responding to technological advances and changing commercial uses of the internet 
we cannot assure you that our internet related products and services will adequately respond to such technological advances and changing uses 
nor can we assure you that the demand for our internet related products and services will increase 
commercial use of the internet raises potential problems with security  privacy  reliability  accessibility  quality of service and government regulation 
these issues  if unresolved  may affect the use of our internet related products 
if these potential problems arise  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not we have recently significantly expanded and may in the future further expand our international operations and enter additional international markets 
this expansion would require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products and services 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  an increasing material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to substantial risks inherent in international business activities  including adverse changes in the political stability and economic environments in these countries and regions  adverse changes in tax  tariff and trade and other regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights in certain of these countries  and difficulties in managing an organization spread on a global basis 
each of the above risks could have a significant impact on our revenues  profitability and our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
since we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in foreign currencies  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects period over period comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged these translation risks because we generally reinvest our cash flows from international operations 
however  we continue to evaluate foreign currency translation risk exposure 
as we continue to grow our international business  the risks associated with foreign currency translation will also grow 
catastrophic events could negatively affect our information technology infrastructure the efficient operation of our business  and ultimately our operating performance  depends on the uninterrupted use of our critical business and information technology systems 
many of these systems require the use of specialized hardware and other equipment that is not readily available in the marketplace 
although we maintain these systems at more than one location  a natural disaster  a fire or other catastrophic event at any of these locations could result in the destruction of these systems 
in such an event  the replacement of these systems and restoration of archived data and normal operation of our business could take several days to several weeks  or more 
during the intervening period when our critical business and information technology systems are fully or partially inoperable  our ability to conduct normal business operations could be significantly and adversely impacted and as a result our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team  ensuring effective transition for key positions and attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
while we believe that we have implemented effective succession plans  we can make no assurance that the loss of key personnel and transitions to new key personnel would not adversely impact our business or result in less effective management or technical teams 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
due to competition for such personnel  we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
our ability to expand and increase revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and training such qualified personnel 
we may not always be able to expand our personnel in these areas as necessary to support our operations 
any recruiting or retention difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to a customer s data  certain of our solutions may be perceived as being insecure and customers may curtail or stop using our service 
certain of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and potential liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
our business depends on proprietary rights that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure  license and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of these rights 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in response to customer requests  we have also on occasion entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention  the imposition of monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
third parties may claim that our solutions infringe on their proprietary rights as a company offering technology solutions  there can be no assurance that third parties also offering technology solutions will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
while we believe that our solutions do not infringe upon proprietary rights of other parties  there can be no assurance that the company would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
any such finding could have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result some of our software is provided by third party vendors 
if our third party vendors are unable to successfully respond to technological change or if our relationships with certain third party vendors are terminated  we may experience difficulty in replacing the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products 
although we believe there are other sources for all of our third party software  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
the results derived from current and future strategic relationships may prove to be less favorable than anticipated we are involved in a number of strategic relationships with third parties and are frequently pursuing others 
should these relationships  or any of them  prove to be more costly than anticipated or fail to meet revenue expectations or other anticipated synergies  we cannot guarantee that such events will not have a material impact upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our data and analytics solutions are dependent upon strategic relationships which  if not maintained  could undermine the continued viability of these solutions our data and analytics solutions are sourced  in part  from data provided through strategic relationships 
although we believe there are other sources for such data  the termination of any of these relationships could diminish the breadth or depth of our data and analytics solutions 
this termination or our failure to establish new strategic relationships in the future could negatively impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
federal and state laws and regulations could depress the demand for some of our solutions while we believe our data and analytics solutions are not in violation of current federal or state laws and regulations pertaining to patient privacy or health information  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  we cannot guarantee that future laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and statutes will not impact negatively upon our ability to market these solutions or cause a decrease in demand for such solutions from customers that see an increased risk in any such new laws or regulations 
governmental regulation may materially and adversely affect our ability to distribute controlled substances through the mail through the interactive marketing business we acquired in the synavant acquisition  we may distribute controlled substances to doctors offices through the mail as part of certain interactive marketing programs provided on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers 
it is important to the business that this practice of distributing prescription only drugs continues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries and our service agreements in such countries are denominated in a foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects period over period comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged translation risks because we generally reinvest our cash flows from international operations 
however  we continue to evaluate foreign currency translation risk exposure 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported operating profit by approximately this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
as we continue to grow our international businesses  the risks associated with foreign currency translation will also grow 
interest rate risk we earn interest income from our balances of cash and short term investments 
this interest income is subject to market risk related to changes in interest rates  which primarily affects our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased approximately this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments and future changes in investment yields
