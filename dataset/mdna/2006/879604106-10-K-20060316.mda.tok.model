item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and related notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements including those related to revenue recognition  guarantees and product warranties and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  underlying run rates and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following are critical judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition for revenue from product sales  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superceded staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectibility of those amounts 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers  estimated returns and allowances  and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded 
the company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required 
sab incorporates emerging issues task force eitf  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
for equipment under lease  revenue is recognized over the lease term for operating lease and rental contracts 
all of the company s leases are accounted for as operating leases 
at the inception of the lease  no lease revenue is recognized and the leased equipment and installation costs are capitalized and appear on the balance sheet as equipment under operating leases 
the capitalized cost of this equipment is depreciated from two to three years  on a straight line basis down to the company s original estimate of the projected value of the equipment at the end of the scheduled lease term 
monthly lease payments are recognized as rental income 
guarantees and product warranties fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must disclose and recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the company s guarantees issued subject to the recognition and disclosure requirements of fin as of december  and were not material 
the company records a liability for potential warranty claims 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
in the event the company determines that its current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed its estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during the year ended december   the company experienced approximately three percent of units returned 
using this experience factor a reserve of  was accrued 
prior to the fiscal year of  the company had not established historical ratio of claims  and the cost of replacing defective products and product returns were immaterial and within management s expectations  accordingly there were no warranties provided with the purchase of the company s products during the year ended december  stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price of the related option 
the company has adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in its financial reports for the years ended december   and and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for its financial reports for the subsequent periods 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on april   the sec amended the effective date of the provisions of this statement 
the effect of this amendment by the sec is that the company will have to comply with statement r and use the fair value based method of accounting no later than the first quarter of the company has previously issued employee stock options for which no expense has been recognized  and which will not be fully vested as of the effective date of sfas no 
r 
the company has assessed the impact sfas r and believes the impact of adopting sfas no 
r  based on our unvested options outstanding at december   will be to increase our pre tax stock based compensation expense in by approximately million
