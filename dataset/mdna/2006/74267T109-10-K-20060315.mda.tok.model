item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share and per share data overview we are a development stage company engaged in research and development of carbohydrate based therapeutic compounds 
we believe our carbohydrate based compounds offer numerous opportunities to provide advanced disease treatments 
our initial focus is on the target delivery of chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of cancer 
we believe our initial carbohydrate compound davanat may increase the body s tolerance to these toxic drugs by targeting the delivery directly to cancerous cells and increasing the efficacy  thereby creating a preferable treatment to existing oncology regimens 
for additional information  please see item business business of pro pharmaceuticals 
all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical and clinical development 
we currently have only one drug candidate davanat in clinical development 
in general  in order to commercialize our current and future drug candidates  we are required to successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
current requirements for regulatory approval include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration fda in an investigational new drug application ind  or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application nda  or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
this process typically takes several years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals will materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from commercial sales relating to our drug candidates 
we do not expect to file an nda for a drug candidate before we anticipate our source of funding for the next several years to come from either financing transactions or collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies 
we are devoting substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development  and raising capital 
we have no source of revenue and have incurred significant losses to date 
we have incurred net losses of  for the cumulative period from inception july  through december  our losses have resulted principally from costs associated with research and development expenses  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future research  discovery  development and commercialization activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we have raised  in capital principally through the issuance of convertible notes  the sale of common stock through a public offering and the sale of common stock and warrants through private placements as of december  from inception july  through december   we used cash of  for our operations 
at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents available to fund future operations  which when combined with  approximately million net of transaction costs we raised through the issuance of convertible debentures and warrants on february   we believe is sufficient to fund our operations through at least june 
table of contents because we lack revenue and must continue our research and development  we must continually identify new sources of capital and complete financing transactions in order to continue our business 
we must continually monitor the monthly burn rate of our capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies  however  are critical to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  which subjects them to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying our accounting policies  our management uses its best judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information available from other outside sources  and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve more complex management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical research organizations cro and investigators in conjunction with pre clinical and clinical trials  professional service fees  such as those arising from the services of attorneys and accountants and accrued payroll expenses 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual services incurred by the service providers 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services or costs of such services  our reported expenses for a reporting period could be understated or overstated 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of services are often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
at this time our primary deferred tax asset relates to our net operating loss carryforwards 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation to employees and non employee directors in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recorded for stock options and restricted stock awards granted at fair market value with fixed terms 
we account for stock or other equity based compensation to non employees utilizing the fair value method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and the emerging issues task force abstract no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with  selling goods or services  and the related interpretations 
under the fair value method  compensation is recorded at the fair value of the consideration 
table of contents received or the fair value of the equity instrument until the final measurement date  which is the earlier of performance completion or vesting 
fluctuations in the quoted market price of the our stock covered by the unvested equity instrument are reflected as adjustments to deferred compensation and compensation expense over the related service period 
we determine the fair value of the equity instrument by using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make certain assumptions 
some of the assumptions  such as the risk free interest rate  come from published sources 
other assumptions  such as the expected life of the equity instrument or the expected volatility of our stock  are subjective and may differ from period to period 
accordingly  changes in the value of our stock or changes in the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the equity instruments  such as the expected life of the options  could have a significant effect on our results of operations in any period 
we consider equity compensation to be an important component in attracting and retaining key employees 
during and  we awarded approximately  and  stock options  respectively  to employees and non employee members of our board of directors for normal services 
because the exercise price of the options granted equal the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant and the options have fixed terms  we recorded no stock compensation expense on these awards 
if we had used the fair value method provided for under sfas no 
our reported net loss of  would have increased by to  in in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires that we measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees in exchange for services and recognize that cost over the period that such services are performed 
we adopted sfas r on january   using the modified prospective transition method 
adoption of sfas r will materially increase our stock compensation expense  net loss and net loss per share  it will not  however  have an impact on our financial position 
for fiscal  total stock based compensation expense  including amounts from stock options using the fair value provisions of sfas r  is estimated to be approximately in order to develop the fiscal stock based compensation expense estimate  we utilized assumptions  including  among other items  expected life and volatility  which reflect assumptions used in total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock awards  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  amounted to at december  the amounts reflected above represent the unamortized value of existing option grants at december  while it is likely that stock options will be granted in  no estimate of grants has been included in the estimate of stock based compensation expense 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared to  incurred during the year ended december  we generally categorize research and development expenses as either direct external expense  comprised of amounts paid to third party vendors for services  or all other expenses  comprised of employee payroll and general overhead allocable to research and development 
we subdivide external expenses between clinical programs and preclinical activities 
we consider a clinical program to have begun upon acceptance by the fda  or similar agency outside of the united states  to commence a clinical trial in humans  at which time we begin tracking expenditures by the product candidate 
we have one product candidate davanat in clinical trials at this time 
clinical program expenses comprise payments to vendors related to preparation for  and conduct of  all phases of the clinical trial  including costs for drug manufacture  patient dosing and monitoring  data collection and management  oversight of the trials and reports of results 
pre clinical expenses comprise all research and development amounts incurred before human trials begin  including payments to vendors for services related to 
table of contents product experiments and discovery  toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies  as well as manufacturing process development for a drug candidate 
our research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  were as follows twelve months ended december  direct external expenses clinical programs pre clinical activities all other research and development expenses in summary  research and development expense in shifted from pre clinical activities to clinical programs 
the increase in clinical trial expense was due to the start up and costs associated with the phase ii trial 
we completed dosing patients in a phase i clinical trial of davanat in march of and began dosing patients in a phase ii clinical trial of davanat in may of while the pre clinical tests and experiments associated with davanat diminished in as compared to in september we submitted an ind to the fda for an additional phase ii clinical trial of davanat fu to treat line one cholangiocarcinoma cancer of the bile duct patients 
we also received clearance from the emea european medical association to begin a phase iii colon cancer trial of davanat fu in combination with other chemotherapy drugs 
these trials are designed to test the efficacy of davanat as a drug delivery compound for specific cancer indications and or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs 
further  on january  we added a chief scientist to our staff 
we expect that these new clinical trials and the addition of our chief scientist will cause our research and development expenses to increase in both the time required and costs we may incur in order to commercialize a drug candidate that would result in material net cash inflow are subject to numerous variables  and hence we are unable at this stage of our development to forecast useful estimates 
variables that make estimates difficult include the number of clinical trials we may undertake  the number of patients needed to participate in the clinical trial  patient recruitment uncertainties  trial results as to the safety and efficacy of our product  and uncertainties as to the regulatory agency response to our trial data prior to receipt of marketing approval 
moreover  the fda or other regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials if we or an agency believes patients in the trial are subject to unacceptable risks  or find deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trial 
delays or rejections may also occur if governmental regulation or policy changes during our clinical trials or in the course of review of our clinical data 
please see risks related to pro pharmaceuticals and risks related to the drug development industry for additional risks and other factors that make estimates difficult at this time 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of costs and completion of our program and the period during which material net cash inflows will commence are unavailable at this time 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in or a decrease of  as compared to  in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  including stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  insurance  investor relations  business development and other office related costs 
the reduction in expense in  consisted of a reduction in legal expense of approximately this was offset by an increase in payroll of approximately and a decrease in all other spending of approximately of the decrease in legal expenses approximately was due to the patent arbitration between dr 
platt  our ceo and glycogenesys which was conducted and completed in the arbitration concerned the rights to control prosecution of some patent applications that 
table of contents dr 
platt licensed to glycogenesys 
in november  the arbitrator awarded the patent prosecution rights to dr 
platt 
the remainder of the decrease in legal expenses as compared to was related to expenses incurred in to defend a lawsuit asserted by a former employee 
this matter was concluded in these expense decreases were offset in part by an increase of approximately associated with legal expenses to defend the counterclaim lawsuit filed by glycogenesys against us and dr 
platt as described in item legal proceedings above 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase somewhat due to the implementation of sfas no 
r which will require us to begin expensing employee stock options in the first quarter of additionally  spending may increase due to increased business development activity  ongoing compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and higher rent associated with finding new leased space to replace our existing expiring space lease 
interest and other income 
interest and other income in was or a decrease of as compared to in interest and other income consists primarily of interest income on interest bearing cash equivalents 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower average cash balances partially offset by higher average interest rates 
average interest rates were approximately per annum in versus approximately per annum in our interest expense will increase in as result of a  convertible debenture which we issued on february  the convertible debenture carries interest at per annum 
the interest may be payable in common stock subject to certain provisions 
the convertible debenture also includes warrant coverage  and we expect the deemed fair value of such warrants  once determined  will be recorded as a debt discount  and such discount will be amortized as additional non cash interest expense 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  in or an increase of as compared to  incurred in research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of clinical research organizations cro  clinical data management services  outsourcing product development to chemical research laboratories regulatory and medical consultants  drug manufacturing for clinical trials  salaries  stock based compensation and other personnel related expenses 
of the  increase  approximately was due to phase i clinical trials of davanat fu and the remainder was due to drug manufacturing for clinical trials  pre clinical product development and cro costs primarily for phase ii clinical trials 
we began our phase i clinical trial of davanat and davanat fu in february due to additional drug administration cycles  enrollment closed in january we completed the sixth and final cohort of the phase i trial in march general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were  in or an increase of  as compared to  in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  including stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  insurance  investor relations  business development and other office related costs 
of the  increase in costs in  approximately  was due to higher legal fees offset by lower expenses in other areas 
approximately of the legal fee increase was incurred in connection with the arbitration between glycogenesys  inc and david platt concerning rights to control prosecution of some patent applications that dr 
platt licensed to glycogenesys 
in november the arbitrator awarded the patent prosecution rights to dr 
platt 
we consider the costs incurred on this matter to be ordinary and necessary for purposes of protection of our intellectual property in general and to enable us to defend the claims against our intellectual property alleged by glycogenesys described in item legal proceedings above 
the remainder of the increase in legal costs was incurred principally for the protection of our intellectual property 
legal expenses in also increased to a lesser degree by expenditures to defend the lawsuit asserted by a former employee 

table of contents additionally  investor relations expense increased by approximately in this increase was offset by lower stock based compensation expense of approximately the lower stock based compensation expense was primarily due to fewer compensatory option grants 
interest and other income 
interest and other income in was or an increase of as compared to in interest and other income consists primarily of interest income on interest bearing cash equivalents 
the increase in interest income is due to higher average cash balances resulting from larger financings in  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
average interest rates were approximately per annum in versus approximately per annum in liquidity and capital resources in thousands as described above in the section entitled overview above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are in the development stage and have not generated any revenues to date 
since our inception on july   we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible debt  shares of common stock and warrants  and a public offering of shares of common stock 
at december   we had raised a total of  from these offerings and had  of cash available 
on february  we raised  resulting in net proceeds after transaction costs of approximately million by issuing convertible debentures and common stock warrants through a private placement 
the convertible debentures and related interest may be repaid in common stock subject to certain provisions 
the details of this transaction are more fully described in note subsequent events to our audited financial statements included with this annual report 
net cash used in operations was  in and  in the decreased use of cash in operations in as compared to was primarily due to lower legal expenses incurred in associated with litigation matters that were resolved in  offset in part by a lower rate of growth in current liabilities in we expect our cash needs to increase in to fund clinical trials and the addition of our chief scientist 
net cash used in operations was  in and  in or an increase of  the increase in was due to the impact of a full year s research and management costs for the phase i clinical trial of approximately  drug manufacturing for clinical trials  pre clinical product development and cro costs primarily for phase ii clinical trials of approximately  and higher legal costs related primarily to the patent arbitration and intellectual property litigation  described in item legal proceedings above  of approximately  net cash used in investing activities was approximately in  in and in the increase in as compared to was due to increased patent costs related to davanat and other carbohydrate based compounds 
of the used in approximately was related to new patents and the remainder was related to furniture and equipment for office expansion 
fixed asset purchases were higher in as we added staff 
we expect patent costs to remain flat in and capital expenditures to increase as a result of relocating our office when our lease expires in may of net cash provided by financing activities was zero in   in   in net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the sale of common stock and warrants through two private equity offerings  structured as pipe transactions private investment in public equity 
in  the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the sale of common stock and warrants in three private placements with net proceeds of  we believe that our cash on hand of  at december  when combined with the approximately million of net proceeds we raised on february  through the issuance of convertible debentures will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating obligations through at least june we will require more cash to fund our operations and believe that we will be able to obtain additional financing 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing or  if available  that such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us
