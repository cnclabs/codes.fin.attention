item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview calamp is a provider of wireless products  engineering services and software that enable anytime anywhere access to critical information  data and entertainment content 
calamp is the leading supplier of direct broadcast satellite dbs outdoor customer premise equipment to the us satellite television market 
the company also provides wireless connectivity solutions for the telemetry and asset tracking markets  public safety communications  the healthcare industry and digital multimedia delivery applications 
the company s dbs reception products are sold primarily to the two us dbs system operators  echostar communications corporation and directv group inc  for incorporation into complete subscription satellite television systems 
the company sells its other wireless access products directly to system operators as well as through distributors and system integrators 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of vytek corporation vytek  a privately held company 
the acquisition of vytek was motivated primarily by the strategic goal of increasing the company s presence in markets which offer higher growth and profit margin potential  and diversifying the company s business and customer base 
concurrent with the acquisition of vytek  the company realigned its operations into a divisional structure 
the legacy operations of calamp  previously segregated into the satellite and wireless access business units  were combined together with vytek s products manufacturing business to form the new products division 
the operations of vytek  which are principally service oriented  comprise the company s solutions division 
on april   the company acquired the business and certain assets of skybility  a privately held company located in carlsbad  california  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated april  skybility is a developer and supplier of embedded cellular transceivers used in telemetry and asset tracking applications that operate on the global system for mobile communications gsm network and the advanced mobile phone service amps network 
the skybility business operates as the machine to machine mm product line of the company s products division 
revenue consists principally of sales of satellite television outdoor reception equipment for the us dbs industry  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in the fiscal year ended february  the dbs system operators have approximately share of the total subscription television market in the us in calendar  the size of the us dbs market is estimated by industry analysts to have grown by from million subscribers to approximately million subscribers at december  the demand for the company s products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from one of calamp s key customers in calamp s satellite products business and the company s ability  as well as the ability of its customers  to manage inventory  the rate of growth in the overall subscriber base in the us dbs market  the economic and market conditions in the wireless communications markets  calamp s ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the rate at which calamp s present and future customers and end users adopt the company s products and technologies in its target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of the company s products 
for these and other reasons  the company s net revenue in fiscal may not necessarily be indicative of future years revenue amounts 
from time to time  the company s key customers significantly reduce their product orders  or may place significantly larger orders  either of which can cause the company s quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
the company expects these fluctuations to continue in the future 
significant opportunities for the company include increasing the company s market share for outdoor reception equipment in the us dbs market  expanding its presence in wireless industry market segments for both fixed and mobile wireless applications  and leveraging calamp s high volume manufacturing capabilities to gain production contracts with customers of the solutions division s product design and consulting engineering services 
the company s principal challenges include maintaining and improving products division gross margin and eliminating operating losses in the solutions division 
basis of presentation the company uses a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to february  which for fiscal years  and fell on february   february  and february   respectively 
in these consolidated financial statements  the fiscal year end for all years is shown as february for clarity of presentation 
fiscal years  and each consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  product warranties  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and the valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for estimated bad debts based upon a review and evaluation of specific customer accounts identified as known and expected collection problems  based on historical experience  due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company s customer base is quite concentrated  with two customers accounting for of the company s fiscal sales 
changes in either a key customer s financial position  or the economy as a whole  could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the recorded allowance amount 
inventories the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed the associated carrying values  inventory carrying amounts are written down 
in addition  the company generally treats inventory on hand or committed with suppliers  which is not expected to be sold within the next months  as excess and thus appropriate write downs of the inventory carrying amounts are established through a charge to cost of sales 
estimated usage in the next months is based on firm demand represented by orders in backlog at the end of the quarter and management s estimate of sales beyond existing backlog  giving consideration to customers forecasted demand  ordering patterns and product life cycles 
significant reductions in product pricing  or changes in technology and or demand may necessitate additional write downs of inventory carrying value in the future 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while it engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance the deferred income tax asset reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized if realization of such asset is more likely than not  based upon the weight of available evidence that includes historical operating performance and the company s forecast of future operating performance 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred income tax asset on a quarterly basis  and a valuation allowance is provided  as necessary 
during this evaluation  the company reviews its forecasts of income in conjunction with the positive and negative evidence surrounding the realizability of its deferred income tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is needed 
during fiscal years and  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by  and  respectively  which had the effect of reducing income tax expense by corresponding amounts in these respective years 
vytek  which was acquired by the company in april  has tax loss carryforwards and other tax assets that the company believes will be utilizable to some extent in the future  subject to change of ownership limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and to the ability of the combined post merger company to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the benefits before the expiration of the applicable carryforward periods 
in the purchase price allocation described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements   was the value assigned to vytek s deferred tax assets  which is net of a valuation allowance of  at february  the company s net deferred income tax asset was  which amount is net of a valuation allowance of  the valuation allowance at february  relates to the tax assets acquired in the vytek purchase 
if in the future a portion or all of the  valuation allowance is no longer deemed to be necessary  reductions of the valuation allowance will decrease the goodwill balance associated with the vytek acquisition 
conversely  if in the future the company were to change its realization probability assessment to less than  the company would provide an additional valuation allowance for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax asset  which would increase the income tax provision 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets other than goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which supersedes sfas no 
and certain sections of accounting principles board opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to address situations where alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during fiscal years and  the company recorded impairment writedowns of  and  respectively  on property and equipment which had become underutilized due to increased outsourcing to contract manufacturers 
there were no impairment charges in fiscal pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates related to the fair values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated and is usually based on projected cash flows or a market value approach 
the goodwill of  that resulted from the vytek acquisition was apportioned on the basis of a valuation analysis between the company s products division and solutions division because both of these reporting units were expected to benefit from the synergies of this business combination 
this valuation analysis resulted in an apportionment of the vytek acquisition goodwill to the products division and the solutions division in the amounts of  and  respectively 
as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company tested its products division goodwill for impairment as of december   which indicated that there was no impairment as of that date 
the initial annual impairment test of the solutions division goodwill was performed during the first quarter of fiscal using a testing date of april   which indicated that there was no impairment of solutions division goodwill 
the company believes the estimate of its valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
results of operations  fiscal years through the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of sales represented by items included in the company s consolidated statements of income year ended february  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangibles in process research and development write off operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income the company s sales and gross profit by business segment for the last three years are as follows revenue by segment year ended february  segment of of of division s total s total s total products    solutions   total    gross profit by segment year ended february  segment of of of division s total s total s total products    solutions   total    the products division generates a substantial portion of its revenue from the sale of outdoor reception equipment for use with subscription satellite television programming services 
such products accounted for approximately  and of total products division revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue products division revenue increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales of wireless products  primarily radio modules to a legacy customer of vytek  increased million over the prior year 
sales of mm products  the product line acquired from skybility in fiscal  contributed a revenue increase of million in fiscal these increases were substantially offset by a decline in dbs product revenue of million from fiscal to the decline in dbs revenue was attributable to a significant shift in product mix 
there was a decline in unit sales of older generation dbs products that have low average selling prices less than per unit which represented an aggregate million decline in dbs revenue  and a increase in unit sales of higher complexity new generation products with higher average selling prices more than per unit which represented an aggregate million increase in dbs revenue 
increased sales of dbs products with medium average selling prices between and per unit and dbs mounting hardware products accounted for the remainder of the net change in year over year dbs revenue 
revenue of the solutions division decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue decrease is primarily the result of the company s actions to eliminate lower margin business in the current year in order to reduce operating losses in this division 
gross profit and gross margins products division gross profit increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the products division gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross profit and margin improvement were mainly due to increased sales of higher margin products  primarily mm products  radio modules and latest generation dbs products 
solutions division gross profit increased  or  and gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal a revenue mix favoring higher margin software products resulted in significantly improved gross margin in fiscal see also note to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated research and development expense r d increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the products division increased its r d spending by million primarily in connection with product development costs relating to the mm product line that was acquired in april the solutions division reduced its r d spending by approximately million 
the solutions division s r d spending is primarily in the development of software products 
consolidated selling expenses increased by  from  last year to  this year  primarily attributable to the products division 
the inclusion of mm selling expenses in the current year as a result of the acquisition of the skybility business in the fiscal first quarter accounted for substantially all of this increase 
consolidated general and administrative expenses g a decreased by  to  in fiscal from  last year 
the decrease is attributable to a reduction of solutions division g a of million as a result of actions taken to improve the cost structure of this division  partially offset by an increase in products division g a of million  mainly from higher payroll related expenses 
amortization expense of intangible assets was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase is attributable to amortization expense related to the intangible assets arising from the april acquisition of the mm product line 
the in process research and development ipr d write off decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal last year s ipr d write off was related to the acquisition of vytek and this year s ipr d write off was related to the acquisition of the mm product line 
see also note to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the mm product line 
operating income operating income increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these results were driven by improved gross margins in both the products and solutions divisions 
the products division s higher gross profit  as discussed above under the headings revenue and gross profit and gross margins  partially offset by the products division s higher operating expenses  contributed to the increase in operating income 
the solutions division also showed an improvement in its operating results in fiscal  reducing its operating loss by about compared to fiscal  which is the result of this division focusing its efforts on attracting higher margin business and changing its cost structure primarily through workforce reductions 
management is closely monitoring the performance of this business unit with the objective of achieving profitable results for the solutions division as soon as possible 
income tax provision the effective income tax rate was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal year  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by  which had the effect of reducing income tax expense in fiscal in fiscal  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by  because this valuation allowance relates to tax assets acquired in the vytek purchase  this  was recorded as a reduction of goodwill and did not impact fiscal income tax expense 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue products division revenue in fiscal increased  or  over fiscal  primarily as the result of increased unit sales of dbs reception equipment  specifically lnbfs 
sales of dbs products increased during fiscal in part because the company began volume shipments of two new products in the fiscal third quarter in support of customers multi satellite and digital video recorder service offerings 
the increasing availability of high definition television programming and the introduction of set top boxes with integrated digital video recorders drove demand for increasingly complex dbs outdoor reception equipment that the company supplies 
these latest generation satellite products typically have higher average selling prices than earlier generation dbs outdoor reception products 
the solutions division revenue in fiscal represented the service operations of vytek which was acquired effective april  the products manufacturing business of vytek is included in the products division 
gross profit and gross margins products division gross profit increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately one half of the gross profit increase was attributable to the  increase in revenue in fiscal  and the remaining gross profit increase was attributable to the year over year improvement in the gross margin percentage 
the products division gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross margin improvement in fiscal was due mainly to the fact that the products division gross margin during fiscal was adversely affected by quarter to quarter volatility in ordering patterns from the company s two key customers 
this demand volatility required the company to make a rapid contraction in production capability in the fiscal first quarter  and a rapid expansion of production capability in the fiscal third quarter  all of which adversely affected manufacturing efficiencies and gross margins during fiscal fiscal gross profit and gross margin of the solutions division were  and  respectively 
during fiscal the company took action to improve the cost structure and gross margins of the solutions division 
see also note to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional operating data by business segment 
operating expenses consolidated research and development r d expense increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase in r d expense was primarily due to the inclusion of the operations of the solutions division in fiscal  which accounted for  or of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to increased salaries and temporary labor expense  increased incentive compensation expense  and increased workers compensation insurance expense 
consolidated sales and marketing expenses increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal substantially all of this increase was attributable to the inclusion of the solution division s operations in fiscal consolidated general and administrative expense increased from  last year to  this year 
the  increase was primarily explained by the inclusion of the solutions division s operations in fiscal  which accounted for  of the increase 
the remaining increase was attributable primarily to increased auditing and accounting fees  increased incentive compensation expense  increased legal expense  increased salaries and wages expense  increased recruiting fees  increased consulting fees  and the fact that the gain on sales of property and equipment  which is netted against g a expense  was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal amortization expense of intangible assets in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal this increase was attributable to the intangible assets arising from the acquisition of vytek in april the write off of in process r d of  in fiscal was also attributable to the vytek acquisition 
operating income operating income was  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increased profitability was attributable to the improvement in the satellite products portion of the company s products division  as discussed above under the headings revenue and gross profit and gross margins 
fiscal operating income of  was comprised of operating income of the products division of  an operating loss of the solutions division of  and unallocated corporate expenses of  the company had taken steps to reduce the losses of the solutions division by strengthening the sales and marketing organization  by reducing overhead costs  and by making a leadership change 
income tax provision during fiscal years and  the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced by  and  respectively  which had the effect of reducing income tax expense by corresponding amounts in these respective years 
the effective income tax rate was and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate in fiscal was attributable primarily to the fact that the reduction in the valuation allowance in fiscal as a percentage of fiscal pretax income was significantly greater than the reduction in the valuation allowance in fiscal as a percentage of fiscal pretax income 
in addition  the company was able to utilize a greater amount of tax credits in fiscal compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  which amounted to  at february   and its million working capital line of credit with a bank 
during fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents increased by  this net increase consisted of cash provided by operating activities of  proceeds from stock option exercises of  and proceeds from sale of property and equipment of  less cash used in the acquisition of skybility business of  repayments of debt of  and cash used for capital expenditures of  cash was used by an increase in operating working capital during fiscal in the aggregate amount of  comprised of a  increase in accounts receivable  a  decrease in accounts payable  and a decrease of  in accrued liabilities  partially offset by a  decrease in inventories and a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the company believes that inflation and foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on its operations in fiscal at february  the company had a million working capital line of credit with a commercial bank that matures on august  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at libor plus or the bank s prime rate  and are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at february   million was outstanding on this line of credit which is classified as long term at that date 
also at that date   was reserved under the line of credit for outstanding irrevocable stand by letters of credit 
the company also has two term loans with this bank that had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of  at february   as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the bank credit agreement that encompasses the working capital line of credit and the two bank term loans contains certain financial covenants and ratios that the company is required to maintain  including a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than  a current ratio of not less than  a leverage ratio of not more than  tangible net worth of at least  and net income of at least in each fiscal year 
the company s bank credit agreement also prohibits payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the bank 
at february  and  the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
the bank credit agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause that enables the bank to call the loans in the event of a material adverse change as defined in the credit agreement in the company s business 
based on the company s history of profitable operations and positive operating cash flow over the past five years  and based on the company s internal financial forecasts for the next year  the company does not believe it is probable that the bank will assert the material adverse change clause in the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations following is a summary of the company s contractual cash obligations as of february  in thousands payments due by period less contractual than obligations year years years total debt    capital leases operating leases     purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations     purchase obligations consist of obligations under non cancelable purchase orders  primarily for inventory purchases of raw materials  components and subassemblies 
the company believes that its cash on hand  its cash generated from operations and the amount available under its working capital line of credit  are collectively sufficient to support operations  fund capital equipment requirements and discharge contractual cash obligations
