item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business for the fourth quarter of reflected strength in international sales offset by minimal sales growth in north america due to a decline in mobile printer shipments to retailers 
we had record sales in latin america 
in our europe  middle east and africa emea region  unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements reduced sales growth in reported us dollars from a record in local currencies 
high growth in supplies sales also had a positive effect on the quarter s results 
profitability declined  as lower average unit prices  warranty expenses and the negative effects of foreign exchange reduced gross margin  and higher payroll expenses  intellectual property work  and new product development and it project costs increased operating expenses 
for  sales growth did not meet our expectations 
international regions benefited from having more zebra representatives serving a broader base of customers in emerging territories 
in north america  however  the significant weakness in sales to retailers  versus robust sales to this sector for  contrasted with firm sales into non retail sectors and improvements in sales of supplies 
delays in new product introductions also restricted sales growth for much of the year 
within this environment  we maintained spending on key strategic activities to extend our global competitive leadership 
these activities include expanding geographically  building stronger channel relationships  and advancing our products and technology to serve a broader range of specialty printing applications 
zebra also incurred higher legal costs  warranty expense  and write offs in product development 
consequently  zebra experienced declines in annual net income and earnings per share

new printer products defined as printers released within months prior to the end of the applicable fiscal period as a percent of total printer product sales were as follows december  three months ended year ended the decline in sales of new printer products is the result of technical problems that delayed the introduction of various new products as well as the shifting of some new product engineering resources to environmental compliance 
we expect several new printer products to begin shipping early in our international sales are denominated in multiple currencies  primarily the dollar  pound and euro 
this directly causes our reported sales to be subject to fluctuations based on changes in currency rates 
we estimate that unfavorable foreign exchange movements of the euro and the pound versus the dollar had a negative impact of  on sales during the fourth quarter and  for the full year

we experienced notable sales growth in mobile printers  as the mainstream adoption of wireless technology had expanded the uses of mobile printing in applications across an increasing number of vertical markets 
in addition  channel programs implemented in north america strengthened and expanded channel partner relationships 
more zebra sales representatives in international territories helped increase the number of channel relationships in overseas regions and support sales growth

these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  which happens at the point of shipment provided that no significant obligations remain  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
historically  our product returns have not been significant 
however  if a significant issue should arise  it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
growth rebates some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding volume rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual volume rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under theses plans have been minimal 
software revenue we sell three types of software and record revenue as follows our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project 
we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware 
revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
shipping and handling we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
from time to time  zebra will enter into sales transactions that include more than one product type 
this bundle of products might include printers  current or future supplies  and services 
when this type of transaction occurs  we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products 
the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the earning process for that product is complete 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities at december   consisted of us government securities  state and municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and partnership interests 
we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  and an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
over the last three years  our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were  or of gross inventory 
we feel this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment during june at that time  no adjustment to goodwill was necessary due to impairment 
we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to  as of december  contingencies we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes 
quarterly  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
for a discussion of all current litigation matters  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k 
stock based compensation as of december   zebra had three stock based compensation plans available for future grants 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
during the first quarter of  we will begin expensing stock options as required under sfas no 
r  share based payments 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k for further discussion 
expectations during our quarterly conference call on february   we provided net sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter of as follows amounts in thousands  except per share data first quarter net sales  to  gross profit margins to operating expenses  to  earnings per share to the above expectations include an estimated per diluted share for the expensing of stock options as required under sfas no 
r  share based payments 
the effective tax rate is expected to be of income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources during the third quarter of  zebra initiated a program to repurchase our own shares 
under this program  we repurchased a total of  shares for  as a result  zebra s cash and investment balances have decreased to  as of december  compared with  at december  other factors affecting cash and investment balances during include note that changes discussed below include the impact of foreign currency operations provided a net cash increase of  primarily from net income 
accounts receivable increased  because of higher sales and slower collections 
days sales outstanding increased to at the end of from at the end of inventories increased  compared to the same period a year ago  inventory turns decreased to from accounts payable increased by  in relation to the increase in inventory 
taxes payable decreased  due to the amount of estimated tax payments made in purchases of property and equipment totaled  acquisition of assets of retail systems international  inc totaled  acquisition of intangible assets totaled  net sales of investments and marketable securities totaled  stock option exercises and purchases under the stock purchase plan contributed  zebra s contractual obligations as of december  were payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  primarily raw materials 
management believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to finance anticipated capital requirements 
it is our intention to actively pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb changed the implementation date for sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the provisions of this statement will now become effective for zebra during the first quarter of we plan to adopt the provisions of this statement using the modified retrospective method  which requires the restatement of the financial statements of all prior years as if the fair value based method of accounting for awards granted  modified  or settled in cash had been used in all fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  we expect the impact on zebra s consolidated financial statements to be consistent with the fair value disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k  with additional restatements made to the balance sheet 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that these costs may be so abnormal that they would require treatment as current period charges 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
this statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement describes our current process  therefore  it will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
zebra is required to adopt this statement during the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk zebra is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of our large investment portfolio 
as stated in our written investment policy  the investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
zebra mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  investment liquidity  and broad diversification across investment strategies  and which limits the types of investments that may be made 
moreover  the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 
the following table sets forth the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates on the value of zebra s investment portfolio in thousands  except per share data 
as of december  interest rate sensitive instruments percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax percentage point movement effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax because these securities are classified as available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the impact of a one percentage point movement in interest rates occurs over an extended period of time as investments are sold and the funds are subsequently reinvested 
foreign exchange risk we conduct business in approximately countries throughout the world and  therefore  are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable 
we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussions of hedging activities

these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies  some of which involve the use of equity securities 
by policy  management limits the amount of zebra s investments in alternative investment strategies to a maximum of of the total investment portfolio  with no single investment exceeding  zebra utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate  foreign exchange and equity price sensitive instruments
