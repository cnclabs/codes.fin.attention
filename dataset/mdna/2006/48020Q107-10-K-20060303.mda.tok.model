item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on the initial semi annual cash dividend declared by our board of directors on august  the following table details the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per common share in thousands  except share data for each of the three years ended december  net income available to common shareholders basic weighted average shares outstanding basic earnings per common share diluted net income available to common shareholders basic weighted average shares outstanding dilutive impact of common stock equivalents outstanding stock options unvested stock compensation programs diluted weighted average shares outstanding diluted earnings per common share new accounting standards accounting for share based compensation sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  was issued in december sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
due to actions by the sec  sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june   which is january  for jones lang lasalle 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
under apb  issuing stock options to employees generally has resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
however  sfas r will require us to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
that cost will be recognized over the employee s requisite service period 
employee share purchase plans espps result in recognition of compensation cost if defined as compensatory  which under sfas r includes a plans that contain a look back feature  or b plans that contain a purchase price discount larger than five percent  which sfas r views as the per share amount of issuance costs that would have been incurred to raise a significant amount of capital by a public offering 
sfas r applies to all awards granted after january  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
the cumulative effect of initially applying sfas r also will be recognized as of january  because a we do not currently  nor plan to  issue stock options under our stock based compensation programs  b we have very few issued stock options with any remaining vesting  and c we have amended our espp to qualify as non compensatory under sfas r  management believes that the application of sfas r will not have a material impact on our financial reporting 
accounting for general partner interests in a limited partnership in june  the fasb ratified eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership  and therefore should consolidate the limited partnership in its financial statements 
to overcome the presumption of control  and thereby account for a general partner investment in a limited partnership on the equity method  eitf requires the general partner to grant certain rights to the limited partners 
eitf applies to limited partnerships created or amended after june   and to all other limited partnerships effective january  eitf also applies to entities similar to limited partnerships  such as limited liability companies with governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership 

table of contents consolidation of existing limited partnerships or similar entities in which we have a general partner or similar interest would result in a material increase in the amount of assets and liabilities reported in our balance sheet 
however  management has intended to retain equity method accounting for general partner or similar interests  and so is in the process of amending partnership agreements  where applicable  to grant limited partner rights sufficient to overcome the eitf control presumption

share repurchases since october  our board of directors has approved four share repurchase programs 
each succeeding program has replaced the prior repurchase program  such that the program approved on september  is the only repurchase program in effect as of december  board approval allows for purchase of our outstanding common stock in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase of shares is primarily intended to offset dilution resulting from both stock and stock option grants made under our existing stock plans 
given that shares repurchased under each of the programs are not cancelled  but are held by one of our subsidiaries  we include them in our equity account 
however  these shares are excluded from our share count for purposes of calculating earnings per share

business restructurings business restructuring charges include severance  professional fees and excess leased space associated with the realignment of our business 
in  the asia pacific business underwent a realignment from a traditional geographic structure to one that is managed according to business lines  and we implemented a broad based restructuring of our global business that reduced headcount by approximately nine percent 
in  we initiated a four percent reduction in workforce to meet expected global economic conditions

as a result of updates to original severance estimates from the and restructurings  we recorded net credits of million in the second quarter of  million in  and million in additionally  the million of net charges in from updates to the identification and valuation of excess leased space referenced above are a result of adjusting original estimates 

table of contents reclassifications during the third quarter of  we reclassified certain charges credits presented within restructuring charges credits in prior quarters for inclusion within compensation and benefits or operating  administrative and other expenses 
reclassifications impacting the december  consolidated financial statements relate to several separate events 
one group of reclassified amounts include legal expenses  severance and collections related to the abandonment of a property management software system in asia pacific and a litigation settlement presented as restructuring charges credits in prior periods

each geographic region offers our full range of investor services  capital markets and occupier services 
the ios business consists primarily of tenant representation and agency leasing  capital markets and valuation services collectively implementation services  and property management  facilities management  and project and development services collectively management services 
total revenue by industry segment includes revenue derived from services provided to other segments 
operating income represents total revenue less direct and indirect allocable expenses 
we allocate all expenses  other than interest and income taxes  as nearly all expenses incurred benefit one or more of the segments 
allocated expenses primarily consist of corporate global overhead  including certain globally managed stock based compensation programs 
these corporate global overhead expenses are allocated to the business segments based on the relative revenue of each segment 
our measure of segment operating results excludes restructuring charges 
see note for a detailed discussion of these restructuring charges 
we have determined that it is not meaningful to investors to allocate these restructuring charges to our segments 
also  for segment reporting we continue to show equity earnings from unconsolidated ventures within our revenue line  especially since it is a very integral part of our investment management segment 
the chief operating decision maker of jones lang lasalle measures the segment results without restructuring charges  but with equity earnings from unconsolidated ventures included in segment revenues

table of contents lasalle investment company effective january   we established lasalle investment company lic  formerly referred to as lasalle investment limited partnership  a series of four parallel limited partnerships  as our investment vehicle for substantially all new co investments 
lic has invested  and will continue to invest  in certain real estate ventures that own and operate commercial real estate 
lic generally invests via limited partnerships and intends to own or less of the respective ventures 
we have an effective ownership interest in lic  primarily institutional investors hold the remaining interest in lic 
a non executive director of jones lang lasalle is an investor in lic on equivalent terms to other investors 
our investment in lic is accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at december   lic has unfunded capital commitments of million  of which our share is million  for future fundings of co investments 
these commitments are part of our maximum potential unfunded commitment to lic at december   which is euro million million 
we also have unfunded capital commitments to other real estate ventures of million  exclusive of our lic commitment structure  at december  lic s exposure to liabilities and losses of the ventures is limited to its existing capital contributions and remaining capital commitments 
we expect that lic will draw down on our commitment over the next three to five years 
additionally  our board of directors has endorsed the use of our co investment capital in particular situations to control or bridge finance existing real estate assets or portfolios to seed future investment funds 
the purpose is to accelerate capital raising and growth in assets under management 
approvals are handled consistently with those of the firm s co investment capital 
for the year ended december   funding of co investments exceeded return of capital by million 
we expect to continue to pursue co investment opportunities with our real estate money management clients in the americas  europe and asia pacific 
co investment remains very important to the continued growth of investment management 
the net co investment funding for is anticipated to be between and million planned co investment less return of capital from liquidated co investments 
as of december   lic maintains a euro million million revolving credit facility the lic facility 
the lic facility contains a credit rating trigger related to the credit rating of one of lic s investors who is unaffiliated with jones lang lasalle and a material adverse condition clause 
if either the credit rating trigger or the material adverse condition clause becomes triggered  the lic facility would be in default and would need to be repaid 
this would require us to fund our pro rata share of the then outstanding balance on the lic facility  which is the limit of our liability 
the maximum exposure to jones lang lasalle  assuming that the lic facility were fully drawn  would be euro million million 
this exposure is included within and cannot exceed our maximum potential unfunded commitment to lic of euro million million discussed above

debt as of december   we had the ability to borrow on a million unsecured revolving credit facility  with capacity to borrow up to an additional million under local overdraft facilities 
on march   we renegotiated our unsecured revolving credit facility  increasing the facility to million and extending the term to there are currently banks participating in our revolving credit facility 
pricing on the million facility ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
upon closing the million facility  pricing decreased to libor plus basis points compared to pricing as of december  of libor plus basis points 
we will continue to use the facility for working capital needs  investments  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we also had short term borrowings including capital lease obligations of million outstanding at december  as of december   million of the total short term borrowings were borrowings by subsidiaries on various interest bearing overdraft facilities 
in june  we utilized our revolving credit facility to redeem all of the outstanding senior notes at a redemption price of of principal 
we incurred pre tax expense of million  which included the premiums paid to redeem the senior notes and the acceleration of debt issuance cost amortization 
the redemption of the senior notes provided savings of approximately million in  as the credit facility s pricing was favorable compared to the senior notes  which carried a interest rate 
jones lang lasalle and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we guarantee the local overdraft facilities of certain subsidiaries 
third party lenders request these guarantees to ensure payment by the company in the event that one of our subsidiaries fails to repay its borrowing on an overdraft facility 
the guarantees typically have one year or two year maturities 
we apply fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  to recognize and measure the provisions of guarantees 
the guarantees of the revolving credit facility and local overdraft facilities do not meet the recognition provisions  but do meet the disclosure requirements of fin we have local overdraft facilities totaling million  of which million was outstanding as of december  we have provided guarantees of million related to the local overdraft facilities  as well as guarantees related to the million revolving credit facility  which in total represent the maximum future payments that jones lang lasalle could be required to make under the guarantees provided for subsidiaries third party debt 
with respect to the renegotiated revolving credit facility  we must maintain consolidated net worth of at least million  a leverage ratio not exceeding to and a minimum interest coverage ratio of to additionally  we are restricted from  among other things  incurring certain levels of indebtedness to lenders outside of the facility and disposing of a significant portion of our assets 
lender approval or waiver is required for certain levels of co investment and acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  we received a waiver from the banks participating in our credit facility to proceed with the acquisition of spaulding slye 
for the year ended december   we also received a waiver to a capital expenditure covenant that otherwise limited our capital expenditures to million in any calendar year 
our renegotiated credit facility does not contain such a covenant 
with these waivers  we are in compliance with all covenants as of december  the revolving credit facility bears variable rates of interest based on market rates 
we are authorized to use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the floating rate indebtedness to a fixed rate  however  none were used during or and none were outstanding as of december  
table of contents the effective interest rate on our debt was in  compared to in the decrease in the effective interest rate is due to a change in the mix of our average borrowings being less heavily weighted toward the higher coupon senior notes  as the senior notes were redeemed in june leases we lease office space in various buildings for our own use 
the terms of these non cancelable operating leases provide for us to pay base rent and a share of increases in operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of defined amounts

we have elected to apply the provisions of apb in accounting for stock options and other stock awards  and accordingly  recognize no compensation expense for stock options granted at the market value of our common stock on the date of grant

table of contents quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of earnings data for each of our past eight quarters 
in our opinion  this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments and accruals  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation 
the unaudited consolidated quarterly information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto as well as the summary of critical accounting policies and estimates section within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
we note the following points regarding how we prepare and present our financial statements on a periodic basis 
periodic accounting for incentive compensation an important part of our overall compensation package is incentive compensation  which is typically paid out to employees in the first quarter of the year after it is earned 
in our interim financial statements we accrue for incentive compensation based on the percentage of revenue and compensation costs recorded to date relative to forecasted revenue and compensation costs for the full year as substantially all incentive compensation pools are based upon revenues and profits 
the impact of this incentive compensation accrual methodology is that we accrue very little incentive compensation in the first six months of the year  with the majority of our incentive compensation accrued in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
we adjust the incentive compensation accrual in those unusual cases where earned incentive compensation has been paid to employees 
in addition  we exclude from the standard accrual methodology incentive compensation pools that are not subject to the normal performance criteria 
these pools are accrued for on a straight line basis 
certain employees receive a portion of their incentive compensation in the form of restricted stock units of our common stock 
we recognize this compensation during the period including both the incentive compensation year and the vesting period of these restricted stock units  which has the effect of deferring a portion of current year incentive compensation to later years 
we recognize the benefit of deferring certain compensation under the stock ownership program in a manner consistent with the accrual of the underlying incentive compensation expense 
the following table reflects the estimates of compensation to be deferred to future years under the stock ownership program for each year to date period in and in millions three months ended march  six months ended june  nine months ended september  twelve months ended december  income taxes we provide for the effects of income taxes on interim financial statements based on our estimate of the effective tax rate for the full year 
we assess our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis and reflect the benefit from tax planning actions when we believe it is probable they will be successful 
we account for the cumulative catch up impact of any change in estimated effective tax rate in the quarter that a change is made 
the effective tax rate we applied to recurring operations for and was as follows three months ended march  six months ended june  nine months ended september  twelve months ended december  seasonality historically  our revenue  operating income and net earnings in the first three calendar quarters are substantially lower than in the fourth quarter 
other than for the investment management segment  this seasonality is due to a calendar year end focus on the completion of real estate transactions  which is consistent with the real estate industry generally 
our investment management segment earns performance fees on clients returns on their real estate investments 
such performance fees are generally earned when assets are sold  the timing of which is geared toward the benefit of our clients 
non variable operating expenses  which are treated as expenses when they are incurred during the year  are relatively constant on a quarterly basis
