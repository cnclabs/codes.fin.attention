for a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance  see the discussion under the caption item a 
risk factors and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products includes g wireless pc card modems  embedded modems  communications software and fmc solutions for wireless network operators  infrastructure providers  distributors  oems and vertical markets worldwide 
through the integration of our hardware and software  our products are designed to operate on a majority of global wireless networks and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
we also offer software engineering  integration and design services to our customers to facilitate the use of our products 
since our inception in  we have been focused on the development and commercialization of technologies that allow for wireless access to data 
we expanded our operations in advance of the launch of several new products in the late s through beginning in  in response to the decline in the telecommunications industry  we implemented an operational and organizational restructuring to increase operating efficiency and conserve working capital 
these restructuring activities included facility consolidations  reduction of employee staff  consultants and temporary labor and critical assessments of asset impairment and obsolete inventory 
beginning in early  we also aggressively pursued the development of innovative g products  refocused our research and development efforts on sales driven customer needs and focused our sales  marketing and distribution efforts on large wireless operators and related companies 
factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products and this may place significant demands on our resources 
revenue 
we believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the increase in demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g products and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  loss of significant customers  
table of contents increase in competition  timing of deployment of g networks by carriers  drop in demand for cdma  evdo  umts and hsdpa products  and changes in technologies 
we began shipping our first g products in december we have shipped nine new g products since then and anticipate introducing additional g products during we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like siemens  alcatel  dell  qualcomm  sprint pcs  verizon wireless and vodafone and major software vendors 
through strategic relationships  we have been able to increase market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
our strategic relationships include technology and marketing relationships with wireless operators  oem customers that integrate our products into other devices  distributors and leading hardware and software technology providers 
for example  we are partnered with both alcatel and siemens on the roll out of hsdpa technology 
cost of revenue 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations to lg innotek  celestica and sercomm 
in addition  we currently outsource certain distribution and fulfillment services related to our business in emea to mobiltron 
all costs associated with these manufacturers and mobiltron are included in our cost of revenue 
cost of revenue also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible licenses  royalties based on a percentage of revenue  operations group expenses  costs related to development services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
during  and  we recorded inventory write downs of million   and million  respectively  primarily due to the decrease in demand for the affected products 
we expect to continue to outsource our manufacturing operations  and as our business grows we expect our manufacturing activity to increase 
operating expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in europe  north america and asia 
if these markets continue to grow  we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses associated with such new product development 
we have in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing revenue from these contracts 
in addition  the portion of our revenue derived from international sales has increased  requiring an expansion of our sales and marketing efforts and logistics support in these markets 
the accounting for stock options beginning in the first quarter of will require us to use the fair value method to account for all stock based compensation pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard  sfas  no 
r  which will significantly increase our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  provision for warranty costs and price protection  useful lives  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  estimates for costs recorded in restructuring and royalty accruals  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  foreign currency translation  foreign exchange forward contracts  and the use of option pricing models to establish values of equity instruments 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators  oem customers and distributors  and  to a lesser extent  from development services contracts 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the latest of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
for product sales with acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized at such time that the acceptance provisions are satisfied 
we grant price protection provisions to certain customers and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns and price protection in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices and historical trends 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
for our fixed price development services contracts  we recognize revenue as services are rendered using labor costs as an input measure 
if the contract includes milestones  we do not recognize revenue until the milestone criteria are met 
total estimated costs are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the project including periodic assessments of the progress achieved and the costs expended to date 
to the extent that our estimated costs materially change  our revenue and profit recorded under the associated contract is adjusted accordingly 
if total costs of completion are estimated to exceed the contract value  a loss is recognized in the period the loss is identified 
during  we amended a joint development agreement containing multiple elements with one of our customers including development services and product shipments 
accordingly  we separated the deliverables into units of accounting and allocated arrangement consideration to these deliverables in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 million in cash payments received in was deferred and is being recognized as revenue when products are shipped or as development services are performed 
during  we recognized approximately million of this deferred revenue and the remaining  was recognized during the first quarter of we do not expect development services revenue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the foreseeable future 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual allowance for doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand as discussed under revenue above  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially 
table of contents less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one year or two year coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency of claims and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual warranty costs and have not experienced significant warranty expenses to date 
future warranty expenses could be materially different  depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their fair values  which are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically three to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that changes rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
royalty costs 
we have intellectual property license agreements which generally require us to make royalty payments based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with the terms of the respective royalty agreements 
we have also accrued for estimated royalty costs in situations where we do not have agreements based upon our current best estimate of the royalty obligation 
these estimates are based on various market data information and other relevant information 
if we enter into such agreements  or when additional market data becomes available  we will revise our estimates if necessary 
income taxes 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
during  we recorded a non cash deferred income tax benefit of million  as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to evaluate the necessity of the valuation allowance based on the remaining deferred tax assets 

table of contents foreign currency translation 
the functional currency of our principal foreign subsidiary is the us dollar 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the relevant balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the year 
translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange forward contracts 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the economic exposure associated with accounts receivable balances denominated in euros 
our forward contracts do not qualify as accounting hedges 
we mark to market the forward contracts and include unrealized gains and losses in the current period as a component of other income expense 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million euros 
stock based compensation 
we periodically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of the grant 
historically  we have accounted for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with stock awards to employees and directors is determined as the difference  if any  between the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date compensation is measured and the price the employee or director must pay to exercise the award 
the measurement date for employee and director awards is the date of grant 
no stock based employee or director compensation expense was recorded in  or  as all options granted during those years had an exercise price greater than or equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and were granted only to employees and directors 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that 


under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal to require treatment as current period charges 


this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they qualify as so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for inventory costs during the fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
in april  the us sec adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application 
under the modified prospective application  sfas no 
r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding and unvested on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date  will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
at december   unamortized compensation expense  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 that we expect to record during fiscal was approximately million before income taxes 
we expect to incur additional expense during fiscal related to new awards granted during fiscal that cannot yet be quantified 
we are currently evaluating the future impact the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our consolidated financial statements and we expect that the adoption will result in a significant increase in non cash operating expenses 

table of contents in march  the sec released sab no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
sab contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as providing the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  and changes the accounting and reporting requirements for a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless doing so is impracticable 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period in which the change occurred the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in the depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
carries forward  without change  the guidance in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements  a change in accounting estimate and a change in reporting entity  as well as the provisions of sfas no 
that govern reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements  but do not expect that the impact will be material 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole  eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host  if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
in addition  among other changes  sfas no 
i clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 ii establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  iii clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and iv eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity qspe from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial interest 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively and is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for fiscal years beginning after september  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in addition  certain of our operating leases related to facilities obligate us to pay an aggregate of approximately million  net of sublease income  over the next months 
this obligation is included in the operating lease commitments in the above table 
we believe that our available cash and investments together with our operating cash flows and available borrowings under our line of credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations  including the continued expansion of our sales and marketing team  the further development of our new products and the related increase in our general and administrative expenses  and to satisfy our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months
