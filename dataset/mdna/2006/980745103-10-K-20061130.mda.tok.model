item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we prepared the following discussion and analysis to help you better understand our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  and results of operations 
this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements 
overview woodward designs  manufactures  and services energy control systems and components for aircraft and industrial engines and turbines 
leading oems throughout the world use our products and services in the power generation  process industries  transportation  and aerospace markets 
our strategic focus is energy control and optimization solutions 
the control of energy fluid energy  combustion  electrical energy  and motion is a growing requirement in the markets we serve 
our customers look to us to optimize the efficiency  emissions  and operations of power equipment 
our core technologies leverage well across our markets and customer applications  enabling us to develop and integrate cost effective and state of the art fuel  combustion  fluid  actuation  and electronic systems 
we focus primarily on oems and equipment packagers  partnering with them to bring superior component and system solutions to their demanding applications 
we have two operating segments industrial controls and aircraft engine systems 
industrial controls is focused on systems and components that provide energy control and optimization solutions for industrial markets  which includes power generation  transportation  and process industries 
aircraft engine systems is focused on systems and components that provide energy control and optimization solutions for the aerospace market 
we use segment information internally to assess the performance of each segment and to make decisions on the allocation of resources 
our sales and earnings have grown over the last four years 
in  our sales exceeded million for the first time in our history and our net earnings were just short of million 
our markets have substantially recovered from the declines that occurred in and and both of our segments benefited from these factors 
in addition  net earnings for benefited from a change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million 
improvement of industrial controls earnings was a key objective for  and its earnings nearly doubled from of sales in to in this improvement was driven by a manufacturing consolidation in and early  supply chain productivity initiatives  and market and management initiated changes in our product mix 
aircraft engine systems continued to generate earnings within our targeted range of to of sales in  and we are continuing to invest substantial amounts in research and development activities to sustain future 
table of contents growth 
company wide  our expenditures for research and development increased in over  largely the result of program wins in the aerospace market over the last few years 
subsequent to the end of  we acquired a business that had sales of million in calendar year this business adds dimension and range to our core technologies and product portfolio for the power generation market  including protection and comprehensive control systems for power distribution applications and power inverters for wind turbines areas we have targeted for growth 
at september   our total assets exceeded million  including million in cash  and our total debt was less than million 
we are well positioned to fund expanded research and development and to explore other investment opportunities consistent with our focused strategies 
the financial statements that are filed as part of this form k reflect the effects of the three for one stock split that became effective during shareholders approved the split in january in the sections that follow  we are providing information to help you better understand our critical accounting policies and market risks  our results of operations and financial condition  and the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
however  you should be aware that this discussion contains statements intended to be considered forward looking statements and therefore entitled to the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of information about forward looking statements  including important factors that could affect our business  results of operations and or financial condition  are included in item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements to be critical accounting policies when they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies normally result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures that follow 
in each of the following areas  our judgments  estimates  and assumptions are impacted by conditions that change over time 
as a result  in the future there could be changes in our assets and liabilities  increases or decreases in our expenses  and additional losses or gains that are material to our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill goodwill  which is included in the segment assets of both industrial controls and aircraft engine systems  totaled million at september   representing of total assets 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and more often if circumstances require 
impairment tests performed during the three years ended september   have not resulted in any impairment losses 
estimates and assumptions  the most important of which are used to estimate the fair value of reporting units within the company  affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
to estimate the fair value of reporting units  we estimate future cash flows  discount rates  and transaction multiples that we believe a marketplace participant would use in an arm s length transaction 
to assess the effect on our annual impairment tests in if different assumptions had been used  we separately measured the effects of a hypothetical reduction in estimated cash flows  a increase in the discount rates used  and a reduction in the transaction multiples used 
while each of these changes would have reduced the estimated fair value of reporting units within the company  none of them individually would have resulted in an impairment loss in other long lived assets as discussed here  our other long lived assets consist of property  plant  and equipment  and other intangibles  which are included primarily in the segment assets of both industrial controls and aircraft engine systems 
other long lived assets totaled million at september   and represented of total assets 
we depreciate 
table of contents or amortize long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation and amortization expense associated with these assets totaled million in  million in  and million in we also test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
the selection of useful lives for depreciation and amortization purposes requires judgment 
if we had increased the remaining useful life of all assets being depreciated and amortized by one year  depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased  and the year end carrying value of long lived assets would have increased  by approximately million in similarly  if we had decreased the remaining useful lives by one year  depreciation and amortization expense would have increased  and the year end carrying value of long lived assets would have decreased  by approximately million in the results of this sensitivity analysis ignore the impact of individual assets that might have become fully depreciated or amortized during had these hypothetical changes been made 
the carrying value of a long lived asset  or related group of assets  is reduced to its fair value whenever estimates of future cash flows are insufficient to indicate the carrying value is recoverable 
we form judgments as to whether recoverability should be assessed  we estimate future cash flows and  if necessary  we estimate fair value 
fair value estimates are most often based on estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowances valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets totaled million at september   representing of deferred income tax assets before the allowances 
the net changes in the valuation allowances increased total comprehensive earnings comprised of net earnings and foreign currency translation adjustments by million in and million in deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  and more weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
valuation allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment 
in  additional objective evidence became available regarding earnings in tax jurisdictions that had unexpired net operating loss carryforwards that affected our judgment about the valuation allowance that existed at the beginning of the year 
if we had made different judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance and income tax expense may have been higher or lower than amounts reported 
retirement pension and healthcare benefits the cost of retirement pension and healthcare benefits is recognized over employee service periods using an actuarial based attribution approach 
our net accrued benefit for these retirement benefits totaled million at september   which represented of total liabilities and consisted of the following in millions pension healthcare benefit obligation fair value of plan assets unrecognized net losses unamortized prior service cost other items affecting the liability 
table of contents the net periodic benefit cost associated with these liabilities totaled million in  which consisted of the following in millions pension healthcare service cost interest cost expected return on plan assets recognized losses recognized prior service cost to determine our net accrued benefit and net periodic benefit cost  we form judgments about the best estimate for each assumption used in the actuarial computation 
the most important assumptions that affect the computations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the healthcare cost trend rate 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
in the united states  we use the blended moody s baa aaa index  the citigroup pension liability index  and the year us treasury rate as benchmarks 
in the united kingdom  we use the aa corporate bond index applicable for bonds over years and government bond yields for bonds over years to determine a blended rate to use as the benchmark 
in japan  we use aa rated corporate bond yields for bonds of years as the benchmark 
our assumed rates do not differ significantly from any of these benchmarks 
we assumed weighted average discount rates of to determine our retirement pension benefit obligation at september   and to determine the related service and interest costs in a increase in these discount rates would have decreased the benefit obligation at the end of by million and increased the total of service and interest costs by million in likewise  a decrease in these discount rates would have increased the benefit obligation by million and decreased the total of service and interest costs by million in we assumed weighted average discount rates of to determine our retirement healthcare benefit obligation at september   and to determine the related service and interest costs in a increase in these discount rates would have decreased the benefit obligation at the end of by million and increased the total of service and interest costs by million in likewise  a decrease in these discount rates would have increased the benefit obligation by million and decreased the total of service and interest costs by million in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was based on our current asset allocations and the historical long term performance for each asset class  as adjusted for existing market conditions 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in
