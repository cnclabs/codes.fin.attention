item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on home video game consoles such as the sony playstation  microsoft xbox and xbox tm  and nintendo gamecube tm  personal computers  mobile platforms including cellular handsets and hand held game players such as the nintendo ds tm and the playstation portable psp tm and online  over the internet and other proprietary online networks 
some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  madden nfl football  the godfather and fifa soccer  and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims tm  need for speed tm and black tm 
our goal is to publish titles with mass market appeal  which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
in addition  we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products eg  madden nfl football  ncaa football and fifa soccer  wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims  need for speed and battlefield and titles based on long lived literary movie properties eg lord of the rings and harry potter 
overview of financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was billion  down percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march  total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was driven by sales of need for speed tm most wanted  madden nfl  fifa  the sims tm  and harry potter and the goblet of fire tm 
four titles sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended march  need for speed most wanted  madden nfl  fifa  and the sims net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  we generated million in cash from operating activities during the year ended march  as compared to generating million for year ended march  the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in our net revenue and an increase in our operating expenses primarily to support the development of next generation console games 
this decrease was partially offset by a lower accounts receivable balance as of march  compared to march   resulting from a higher percentage of revenue recognized in the first two months of our fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  which allowed us to collect a higher percentage of our revenue during the quarter 
management s overview of historical and prospective business trends transition to next generation consoles 
our industry is cyclical and in the midst of a transition stage heading into the next cycle 
during the three months ended december   microsoft launched the xbox  and sony and nintendo have both announced their intention to introduce new video game consoles in the coming months 
we expect that  as the current generation of consoles continue to progress 
table of contents and eventually reach the end of their commercial life cycle and next generation consoles are introduced into the market  sales of video games for current generation consoles will continue to decline as consumers replace their current generation consoles with next generation consoles  or defer game software purchases until they are able to purchase a next generation console 
this pattern is referred to in our industry as a transition to next generation consoles 
during this transition  we intend to continue to develop new titles for current generation video game consoles while we also continue to make significant investments in the development of products for next generation consoles 
we expect the average selling prices and the number of units of our titles for current generation consoles to continue to decline as more value oriented consumers purchase current generation consoles  a greater number of competitive titles are published at reduced price points  and consumers defer purchases in anticipation of next generation consoles 
we expect our gross margins to be negatively impacted by a decrease in average selling prices of titles for current generation platforms  higher license royalty rates  and amortization of our newly acquired intangible assets 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  higher costs during this transition to next generation consoles 
moreover  we expect development costs for next generation video games to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for current generation video games 
we also expect our operating expenses to increase for the fiscal year ending march  as compared to prior fiscal years  primarily as a result of the recognition of stock based compensation due to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised sfas no 
r  and higher expenditures for research and development due to our investment in next generation consoles  online and mobile platforms 
as we move through the life cycle of current generation consoles  we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of current generation titles while at the same time continuing to invest heavily in tools  technologies and titles for the next generation of platforms and technology 
we expect our operating results to continue to be volatile and difficult to predict  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
expansion of mobile platforms 
advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for on the go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic of consumers 
our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two broad areas packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets 
we have developed and published games for a variety of handheld platforms  including the nintendo gameboy and gameboy advance  for several years 
the introductions of the sony psp and the nintendo ds  with their richer graphics  deeper gameplay  and online functionality  provide a richer mobile gaming experience to consumers 
as a result  we have seen  and expect to continue to see  an increase in demand for our games for handheld platforms 
in fiscal  our net revenue from handheld platforms increased percent over fiscal to million 
as cellular handsets become more and more commonplace and wireless technology advances to include high resolution color displays  increased processing power and improved audio capabilities  we expect sales of games for cellular handsets to become an increasingly important part of our business worldwide 
to accelerate our position in this growing segment  in february  we acquired jamdat mobile inc jamdat  a global publisher of wireless games and other wireless entertainment applications 
as a result of this acquisition  in fiscal  we expect our net revenue from games for cellular handsets to increase significantly from million in fiscal likewise  the acquisition  along with the additional investment required to grow this portion of our business globally  will result in increased development and operating expenses 
as mobile technology continues to evolve and the installed base of both handheld game systems and cellular phones expands  we expect that sales of our titles for mobile platforms for both handhelds and cellular handsets will become an increasingly important part of our business 
investment in online 
today  we generate net revenue from a variety of online products and services  including casual games and downloadable content marketed under our pogo brand  persistent state world 
table of contents games such as ultima online tm  pc based downloadable content and online enabled packaged goods 
as the nature of online game offerings expands and evolves  we anticipate long term opportunities for growth in this business 
for example  we expect that consumers will take advantage of the online connectivity of next generation consoles at a much higher rate than they have so far on current generation consoles  allowing more consumers to enhance their gameplay experience through multiplayer activity  community building and downloading content 
we also plan to increase the amount of content available for download on the pc and consoles  and to enable entire pc based games to be downloaded electronically 
in addition  we plan to expand our casual game offerings internationally and to invest in growing genres such as advanced casual games 
although we intend to make significant investments in online products  infrastructure and services and believe that online gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our business in the long term  we do not expect revenue from persistent state world games or online gameplay and distribution to be significant in fiscal international expansion 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal we expect international sales to remain a fundamental part of our business 
we believe that in order to succeed in asia  it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward asian cultures and consumers 
as such  we expect to continue to devote resources to hiring local development talent and expanding our infrastructure outside of north america  most notably  through the expansion and creation of local studio facilities in asia 
in addition  we are in the process of establishing online game marketing  publishing and distribution functions in china 
further  we are planning to expand our development and publishing activities in the cellular handset games business in europe and asia 
as part of our international expansion strategy  we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar arrangements 
sales of hit titles 
sales of hit titles  several of which were top sellers in a number of countries  contributed significantly to our net revenue 
our top selling titles across all platforms worldwide during the year ended march  were need for speed most wanted  madden nfl  fifa  the sims  and harry potter and the goblet of fire 
hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale 
we have developed  and it is our objective to continue to develop  many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 
increasing licensing costs 
we generate a significant portion of our net revenue and operating income from games based on licensed content such as madden nfl football  fifa soccer  harry potter and espn 
we have recently entered into new licenses and renewed older licenses  some of which contain higher royalty rates than similar license agreements we have entered into in the past 
we believe these licenses  and the product franchises they support  will continue to be important to our future operations  but the higher costs of these licenses will negatively impact our gross margins 
international foreign exchange impact 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal and approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and  to a lesser extent  in asia 
foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our net revenue of million  or percent  for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  acquisitions  investments and strategic transactions 
we have engaged in  evaluated  and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including acquisitions of companies  businesses  intellectual properties  and other assets  and investments in new interactive entertainment businesses for example  online and mobile games 
in fiscal  we acquired jamdat as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in mobile gaming  and in fiscal we acquired criterion software group  ltd 
criterion  and took a controlling interest in digital illusions ce dice 
we signed an agreement to fully merge dice into ea  which will allow dice to become an integrated studio 
the merger is expected to be completed during our fiscal quarter ending september  
table of contents stock based compensation 
on april   the first day of our current fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to recognize compensation expense for all stock based compensation based on estimated fair values 
as a result  beginning with our first quarter of fiscal  our operating results will contain a charge for stock based compensation related to the equity based compensation we provide to our employees  as well as stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
this expense will be in addition to the stock based compensation expense we have recognized in prior periods related to restricted stock unit grants  acquisitions and other grants 
the stock based compensation charges we incur will depend on the number of equity based awards we grant  the number of shares of common stock we sell under our employee stock purchase plan  as well as a number of estimates and variables such as estimated forfeiture rates  the trading price and volatility of our common stock  the expected term of our options  and interest rates 
as a result  our stock based compensation charges can vary significantly from period to period 
the expensing of stock based compensation will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and may not be similar to our pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the sony psp  nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets 
we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as revised by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products must be present in order to recognize revenue 
delivery delivery is considered to occur when the products are shipped and risk of loss and reward have been transferred to the customer 
for online games and services  revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
fixed or determinable fee if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize that amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
collection is deemed probable at the time of the transaction  we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for 
table of contents example  for multiple element arrangements  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes to any of these assumptions or judgments  or changes to the elements in a software arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
product revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors channel partners  is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc and video game system products  which allow for the exchange of these products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits  rather than give cash refunds 
in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the video game market and the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns and or price protection for our products may continue to increase as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube consoles move through their lifecycles and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers and co publishing and or distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for delivery of product 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or 
table of contents an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for hit based titles is particularly difficult due to the inherent risk of such titles 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the royalty expense we recognize 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally in connection with the development of a particular product and  therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no significant performance remains with the licensor 
when significant performance remains with the licensor  we record royalty payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than upon execution of the contract 
minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months 
as of march  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized 
each quarter  we also evaluate the future realization of our royalty based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
in either case  we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and commitments 
if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate  then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists 
this evaluation requires us to estimate  among other things  the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business 
these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment 
our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 
under current accounting standards  we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles  handheld game players  pcs and cellular handsets platforms 
the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
due to product sales shortfalls  we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets  which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future 
we did not record any asset impairment charges in fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we recognized less than million of asset impairment charges 

table of contents income taxes in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues  require extended periods of time to resolve  and require us to make judgments  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate and result in a variance between the projected effective tax rate for any quarter and the final effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
with respect to our projected annual effective income tax rate at the end of each quarter prior to the end of a fiscal year  we are required to make a projection of several items  including our projected mix of full year income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
this projection is inherently uncertain and can fluctuate throughout the fiscal year 
the projected annual effective income tax rate may also be adjusted for taxes related to certain anticipated changes in how we do business 
significant non recurring charges are taken in the quarter incurred 
the actual results could and often does vary from those projections  and as such  the overall effective income tax rate for a fiscal year could be different from that previously projected for the full year 
results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a or week period that  historically  has ended on the final saturday of march in each year 
beginning with the fiscal year ended march   we end our fiscal year on the saturday nearest march as a result  fiscal contains weeks with the first quarter containing weeks 
our results of operations for the fiscal years march    and contain the following number of weeks fiscal years ended number of weeks fiscal period end date march  weeks march  march  weeks april  march  weeks march  march  weeks march  for simplicity of presentation  all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net revenue we principally derive net revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and mobile platforms which include handheld game players such as the sony psp  nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets 
we also derive net revenue from selling services to some of our online games  programming third party web sites with our game content  allowing other 
table of contents companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products  and selling advertisements on our online web pages 
from a geographical perspective  our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended march  and was as follows in millions year ended march  increase decrease change north america europe asia international total net revenue north america for fiscal  net revenue in north america was  million  driven primarily by sales of madden nfl  need for speed most wanted  nba live  ncaa football and the sims  titles for the psp  which was launched in north america in march  and titles for the xbox  which launched in november overall  net revenue decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal as noted in the overview section above  our industry is in the midst of a transition from current generation to next generation consoles 
our net revenue was adversely impacted by this transition in fiscal as overall net revenue from sales of our titles for the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube decreased 
while sales of titles for the psp and the xbox helped to mitigate the impact of the transition in fiscal  they were not enough to offset the overall decrease in net revenue in north america 
as the transition to next generation consoles continues in fiscal  we expect net revenue from sales of titles for current generation consoles to further decline 
from a title and franchise perspective  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower sales from our nfl street  nba street  def jam and the urbz tm franchises as there were no corresponding titles released during fiscal  and lower sales from our lord of the rings franchise which was released on multiple platforms during fiscal as compared to two platforms  the psp and pc  during fiscal the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by sales of battlefield tm on the pc which was released during the first quarter of fiscal and battlefield modern combat tm on the playstation and xbox released during the third quarter of fiscal  increased net revenue from our madden franchise primarily resulting from the release of madden nfl on the xbox and psp in fiscal  and increased net revenue from our burnout franchise primarily resulting from the release of burnout tm revenge on the xbox and burnout tm legends on the psp in fiscal europe for fiscal  net revenue in europe was  million  driven primarily by sales of need for speed most wanted  fifa  the sims  harry potter and the goblet of fire  as well as sales of titles for the psp and xbox which were both introduced in europe during fiscal overall  net revenue declined million  or percent  as compared to fiscal we estimate that foreign exchange rates primarily the euro and the british pound sterling decreased reported european net revenue by approximately million  or percent  net of realized gains from hedging activities  for the fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates  we estimate that european net revenue decreased by approximately million  or percent  for fiscal our net revenue in europe was adversely impacted by the transition to next generation consoles in fiscal as overall net revenue from sales of our titles for the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube decreased 
sales of titles for the psp  nintendo ds  and the xbox  however  were enough to offset the overall decrease in net revenue from sales of titles for current generation consoles 

table of contents from a title and franchise perspective  the overall decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower sales from our lord of the rings and the sims franchises  the release of the urbz tm sims in the city tm during the three months ended december  as there was no corresponding title released during fiscal  and higher fiscal sales of uefa euro tm  which was released in the three months ended june  in conjunction with the uefa euro football tournament held in europe 
the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by increased net revenue from our battlefield franchise due to the release of multiple titles during fiscal and our fifa street franchise due to the initial release of fifa street late in the fourth quarter of fiscal which benefited fiscal and the release of fifa street earlier in the fourth quarter of fiscal asia for fiscal  net revenue in asia increased by million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue for fiscal was driven primarily by sales of titles for the psp  which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal we estimate that the foreign exchange rate impact on asia net revenue was not material for fiscal as compared to fiscal our total net revenue by product line for fiscal years and was as follows in millions year ended march  increase decrease change consoles playstation xbox xbox n m nintendo gamecube other consoles total consoles pc mobility psp nintendo ds game boy advance and game boy color cellular handsets n m total mobility co publishing and distribution internet services  licensing and other subscription services licensing  advertising and other total internet services  licensing and other total net revenue playstation for fiscal  net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation was  million  driven primarily by sales of need for speed most wanted  madden nfl  fifa  ncaa football and nba live we released titles for the playstation during fiscal  as compared to titles in fiscal overall  playstation net revenue decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal as noted above  we believe the transition to next generation consoles adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the playstation in fiscal we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the 
table of contents playstation to continue to decrease in fiscal as we move through the transition to next generation consoles 
from a title and franchise perspective  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower sales from our lord of the rings  the urbz  def jam  nfl street and nba street franchises  none of which had fiscal releases  and lower sales of fiscal releases from our need for speed and bond franchises as well as lower sales of our fight night franchise from which two titles were released in fiscal as compared to one title in fiscal the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by the releases of the godfather tm the game  black tm  medal of honor european assault tm  and battlefield modern combat none of which had a corresponding release in fiscal xbox for fiscal  net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox was million  driven primarily by sales of madden nfl  need for speed most wanted  ncaa football and burnout revenge 
we released titles for the xbox during fiscal  as compared to titles in fiscal overall  xbox net revenue decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal we believe the transition to next generation consoles  particularly the launch of the xbox during the last half of fiscal  adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox in fiscal we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the xbox to continue to decrease in fiscal as we move through the transition and the xbox installed base grows 
from a title and franchise perspective  the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower sales from our lord of the rings  nfl street  def jam  nba street and the urbz franchises  none of which had fiscal releases  and lower sales of fiscal releases from our need for speed and bond franchises as well as lower sales of our fight night franchise from which two titles were released in fiscal as compared to one title in fiscal the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by the release of battlefield modern combat  black and the godfather the game  none of which had a corresponding release in fiscal xbox the xbox was launched in north america  europe and japan during the three months ended december   and in the rest of asia during the three months ended march  as of march  the installed base of the xbox continued to be small compared to the installed base of the xbox

we believe the transition to next generation consoles adversely impacted our net revenue from sales of titles for the nintendo gamecube in fiscal we expect net revenue from sales of titles for the gamecube to continue to decrease in fiscal as we move through the transition to next generation consoles 
from a title and franchise perspective  the decrease in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to lower sales from our lord of the rings  the urbz  nba street  nfl street and def jam franchises  none of which had fiscal releases  and lower sales of fiscal releases from our need for speed and bond franchises 
pc for fiscal  net revenue from sales of titles for the pc was million  driven primarily by sales of titles from the sims franchise and battlefield we released titles for the pc during fiscal  as 
table of contents compared to titles in fiscal overall  pc net revenue decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to significantly higher fiscal sales of the sims  lower sales from our medal of honor tm franchise as there were no corresponding titles released during fiscal  and lower sales from our lord of the rings franchise 
the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by current year sales of products from our battlefield franchise 
on january   we began consolidating the financial results of digital illusion ce a game development company based in sweden of which we are the majority owner into our financial statements  and  therefore  have characterized battlefield pc based revenue as part of our pc product line 
prior to consolidating dice s financial results  we classified revenue from the battlefield franchise as co publishing and distribution revenue 
mobile platforms net revenue from mobile products consisting of packaged goods games for handheld systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to sales of titles released in fiscal for the psp  and the nintendo ds  both of which were launched in fiscal in certain countries 
we released titles for the psp during fiscal  as compared to three titles in fiscal overall  psp net revenue increased million  driven primarily by sales of titles from our need for speed  fifa  burnout and madden franchises 
we released ten titles for the nintendo ds during fiscal  as compared to three titles in fiscal nintendo ds net revenue increased million  driven primarily by sales of titles from our need for speed  the sims and madden franchises 
the increase in psp and nintendo ds net revenue was partially offset by lower sales of titles for the game boy advance 
we expect mobile platform revenue to continue to increase in fiscal  driven primarily by anticipated growth in our cellular handset games business 
co publishing and distribution net revenue from co publishing and distribution products decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the change in our classification of sales of products from our battlefield franchise  which  as discussed above  we no longer classify as co publishing and distribution revenue  and overall higher fiscal sales of various co publishing and distribution titles 
the overall decrease in net revenue was mitigated by sales of half life in fiscal subscription services net revenue from subscription services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of paying subscribers to club pogo tm  partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from ultima online

for fiscal  our effective income tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate of percent for fiscal due to a number of factors  including the repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  as discussed below  and additional charges resulting from certain intercompany transactions during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  which were partially offset by other items 

table of contents we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us taxes have been provided thereon

in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes which addresses the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
including subsequent updates issued by the fasb  the proposed interpretation provides that the best estimate of the impact of a tax position would be recognized in an entity s financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit based solely on its technical merits 
this proposed interpretation also would provide guidance on recognition and measurement  balance sheet presentation  disclosure  accrual of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and transition 
we cannot predict what actions the fasb will take or how any such actions might ultimately affect our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb announced that companies would not have to apply the proposed interpretation until fiscal years beginning after december  an exposure draft of proposed amendments to sfas no 
is expected in the third quarter of calendar year our effective income tax rates for fiscal and future periods will depend on a variety of factors 
for example  changes in our business  including acquisitions and intercompany transactions  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  as well as changes in  or termination of  our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated income 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income than higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
net income net income for fiscal years and was as follows in millions march  of net march  of net revenue revenue change change reported net income decreased by million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our net revenue and growth in our operating expenses 
the growth in our operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in research and development expenses as we increased our internal development efforts and invested in next generation tools  technologies and titles  while at the same time we continued to support current generation product development 
we expect our net income to decline in fiscal as a result of the effect of stock based compensation charges required by our adoption of sfas no 
r  and our continued support of current generation product development while at the same time making significant investments in next generation consoles  online and mobile platforms

 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supersedes accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
while the fair value method under sfas no 
r is similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
with regards to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  there are several key differences between the two standards 
for example  sfas no 
permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 
r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
sfas no 
r will also require a classification change in the statement of cash flows  whereby a portion of the income tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flow activities to financing cash flow activities total cash flows will remain unchanged 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec released sab no 
 share based payment  which provides the sec s views regarding the interaction between sfas no

r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
the fasb provides companies with a practical accommodation when determining the grant date of an award subject to sfas no 
r 
if the award is a unilateral grant  that is  the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the key terms and conditions of the award with the employer  the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period  and as long as all other criteria in the grant date definition have been met  then a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award is presumed to exist at the date the award is approved 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
the fasb allows for a practical exception in calculating the additional paid in capital pool of excess tax benefits upon adoption that is available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized

r  classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event  which amends certain paragraphs in sfas no

fsp fas no 
r addresses situations when a company has option plans that require the company to settle outstanding options in cash upon the occurrence of certain contingent events 
although we are required to apply fsp fas no 
r when we initially adopt sfas no 
r  we do not expect it to impact our consolidated financial statements

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
under previous guidance  changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative effect in the net income of the period of the change 
the new statement requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle  limited to the direct effects of the change  to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
additionally  this statement requires that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that  upon adoption  sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  after adoption  if a change in accounting principle is made  sfas no 
could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and market prices 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign currency option and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to either hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to market risk 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
interest rate risk is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
foreign currency exchange rate risk from time to time  we hedge some of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative 
table of contents assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses  as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded 
the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reported in each period in interest and other income  net in our consolidated statement of operations 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and operating expenses 
as of march   we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts outstanding with a total fair value of million included in other current assets 
we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of approximately one month and are transacted near month end 
therefore  the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each month end 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income  net 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of march   we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars 
as of march  we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars 
the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and march  the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would not have resulted in a material loss in fair value of our option contracts under either scenario 
however  a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of million and million  respectively  as of march   and million and million  respectively  as of march  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
additionally  the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value of the securities 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments or leverage in our short term investment portfolio 

table of contents as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale and  consequently  recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of any tax effects  in stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  us agency securities us treasury securities corporate bonds asset backed and other debt securities total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations
