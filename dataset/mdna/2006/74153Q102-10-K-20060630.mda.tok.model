item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with financial statement and supplementary data in item of this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements below 
overview we provide contract drilling and related services to oil and natural gas companies worldwide  operating both offshore and on land 
as of june   we operated a global fleet of rigs  including two ultra deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackup rigs  tender assisted  barge and platform rigs and land based drilling and workover rigs 
we operate in more than countries and marine provinces and employ approximately  employees and contractors 
our customers include the major integrated oil and natural gas companies  independent oil and natural gas companies and state owned national oil companies 
our competitors range from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller  locally owned companies 
we operate through five principal reporting segments eastern hemisphere  which comprises our offshore and land based drilling activity in europe  africa  the middle east  southeast asia and the caspian sea  western hemisphere  which comprises our offshore drilling activity in latin america  currently brazil  mexico and venezuela  us gulf of mexico  which comprises our us offshore platform and jackup rig fleets  latin america land  which comprises our land drilling and workover activity currently in argentina  bolivia  colombia  mexico and venezuela  and e p services  which comprises our services to exploration and production companies in latin america 
for additional segment information for the three years ended december   see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the markets for our drilling  workover and related e p services are highly cyclical 
our operating results are significantly impacted by the level of energy industry spending for the exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling and related services 
these drilling programs are affected by oil and natural gas companies expectations about oil and natural gas prices  anticipated production levels  demand for crude oil and natural gas 
table of contents products  government regulations and many other factors 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by our customers for oil and natural gas drilling and related services 
variations in market conditions during the cycle impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different regions 
contracts in the us gulf of mexico  for example  tend to be short term  so a deterioration or improvement in market conditions tends to impact our operations quickly 
contracts in the eastern and western hemispheres tend to be longer term 
accordingly  short term changes in market conditions in these segments may have little or no short term impact on our revenues and cash flows from those operations unless the market changes occur during a period when we are attempting to renew a number of those contracts 
during  we continued to focus our efforts on reducing debt  managing cash flow and evaluating our assets to increase return on invested capital 
as part of this strategy  we sold various non core assets for aggregate cash proceeds of million 
in march and april  holders of substantially all of the million outstanding principal amount of our convertible senior notes due converted the notes into approximately million shares of our common stock  and we redeemed the remaining principal amount in april in september  we repaid the remaining balance of our senior secured term loan 
during  we reduced the total of our long term debt by million as a result of the notes conversion and the repayment of debt with cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales and stock option exercises 
in december  we acquired an additional interest in our joint venture companies that manage our angolan operations from our partner  the national oil company of angola  for million in cash 
we now own of the joint venture companies 
the principal assets of the joint venture companies include the two ultra deepwater drillships pride africa and pride angola  the jackup rig pride cabinda and management agreements for the deepwater platform rigs kizomba a and kizomba b 
in addition  we paid million to an affiliate of our partner for termination of certain agreements related to the operation of the joint venture 
we funded the purchase price and the termination payment with borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
fcpa investigation during the course of an internal audit and investigation relating to certain of our latin american operations  our management and internal audit department received allegations of improper payments to foreign government officials 
in february  shortly after and as a result of certain statements that were made by an employee during the investigation  the audit committee of our board of directors assumed direct responsibility over the investigation and retained independent outside counsel to investigate the allegations  as well as corresponding accounting entries and internal control issues  and to advise the audit committee 
the investigation  which is continuing  has found evidence suggesting that payments  which may violate the us foreign corrupt practices act  were made beginning in early through to government officials in latin america aggregating less than million over the period 
the evidence to date suggests that these payments primarily were made a to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials for the purpose of extending drilling contracts for two jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig operating offshore venezuela  b to one or more government officials  or to vendors with the intent that they would be transferred to government officials  for the purpose of collecting receivables for work completed under offshore drilling contracts in venezuela  and c to one or more government officials in mexico in connection with the clearing of a jackup rig and equipment through customs 
our management and the audit committee of our board of directors believe it likely that members of our senior operations management either were aware  or should have been aware  that improper payments to foreign government officials were made or proposed to be made 
we have placed certain members of our senior operations management on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation 
our chief operating officer resigned as chief operating officer effective on may  and has elected to retire from the company  although he will remain an employee  but not an officer  during the pendency of the investigation to assist us with the investigation and to be available for consultation and to answer questions relating to our business 
as described in item of this annual report  his retirement benefits will be subject to the determination by our audit committee or 
table of contents our board of directors that it does not have cause as defined in his retirement agreement with us to terminate his employment 
we voluntarily disclosed information relating to the initial allegations and other information found in the investigation to the us department of justice and the securities and exchange commission and are cooperating with these authorities as the investigation continues and as they review the matter 
if violations of the fcpa occurred  we could be subject to fines  civil and criminal penalties  equitable remedies  including profit disgorgement  and injunctive relief 
civil penalties under the antibribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly a monitor being appointed to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions 
our customers in venezuela and mexico could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current clients and potential clients  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets 
no amounts have been accrued related to any potential fines  sanctions or other penalties 
we have taken and will continue to take disciplinary actions where appropriate and various other corrective action to reinforce our commitment to conducting our business ethically and legally and to instill in our employees our expectation that they uphold the highest levels of honesty  integrity  ethical standards and compliance with the law 
these actions continue a process we had previously commenced 
since late  we have created and filled a legal and ethical compliance function under the supervision of our senior vice president  general counsel and secretary 
we have established an antibribery compliance committee and enhanced our antibribery compliance procedures 
we also have developed in person and online training programs to provide annual instruction on our code of business conduct and ethical practices  the fcpa  antitrust law and other key policies as part of our commitment to educate our international workforce 
in  we have also continued to enhance our training of management  including our operations managers  to emphasize further the importance of setting the proper tone within their organization to instill an attitude of integrity and control awareness and the use of a thorough and proper analysis of proposed transactions  determined that all of our bonus eligible employees complete in person and online training on the fcpa and our code of business conduct and ethical practices as a prerequisite to receiving their bonuses for  required our management  including our operations managers  to reconfirm that they are not aware of any violations of law and confirm with greater specificity that they are not aware of any improper payments to foreign government officials made by us or on our behalf or any other violation of our code of business conduct and ethical practices and to recertify their commitment to the code  established an executive compliance committee  consisting of our executive officers and other management level employees who are responsible for supervising our antibribery compliance committee  our internal controls steering committee and our compliance efforts in general  and established a separate position of  and appointed  a chief compliance officer  effective june  we cannot currently predict what  if any  actions may be taken by the doj  the sec  the applicable government or other authorities or our customers or the effect the actions may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  on our consolidated financial statements or on our business in venezuela and other jurisdictions 
our operations in venezuela provided revenues of approximately million  or approximately of our total consolidated revenues for  and earnings from operations of approximately million  or approximately of our total consolidated earnings from operations for in addition  in our venezuelan operations represented of our revenues and of our earnings from operations in our western hemisphere segment  of our revenues and of our earnings from operations in our latin 
table of contents america land segment and of our revenues and of our earnings from operations in our e p services segment 
as of december  and may   we had accounts receivable from petr leos de venezuela  sa totaling million and million  respectively 
while our investigation to date of these matters and related internal control systems and processes has been ongoing for some time  at this time there can be no assurances that the investigation will not uncover other violations within our global operations  including in countries outside latin america 
business environment revenues 
our revenues depend principally upon the number of our available rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the contract day rates received 
the number of days our rigs are utilized and the contract day rates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply and demand for drilling and related services in the different geographic regions in which we operate 
the number of available rigs may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition  relocation or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs and the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired or undergoing periodic surveys or routine maintenance at any time 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher contract day rates  we may mobilize our rigs from one geographic region to another 
operating costs 
earnings from operations are primarily affected by changes in revenue  but are also a function of changes in operating costs 
operating costs may be influenced by changes in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of the rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which reduces expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income associated with the loss of revenues 
we recognize as an operating cost routine overhauls that maintain rather than enhance the capability or extend the life of the rigs or e p services equipment 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the assets 
depreciation expense decreases earnings from operations in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses are principally related to our corporate headquarters and the administrative functions of our regional offices 
environmental regulation 
our operations and activities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the us oil pollution act of  the us outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships 
additionally  other countries where we operate have similar laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants in connection with drilling operations 
business outlook although natural gas prices have declined sharply since mid december  oil and natural gas prices continue to be at historically high levels  and we expect prices to remain high for the near future 
expectations about future prices have historically been a key driver for drilling demand  however  the availability of quality drilling prospects  exploration success  relative production costs  the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers drilling programs 
we expect demand for contract drilling services to continue to increase driven by increasing demand for oil and natural gas and an increased focus by oil and natural gas companies on offshore prospects 
our operations are geographically dispersed in oil and natural gas exploration and development areas throughout the world 
rigs can be moved from one region to another 
the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary somewhat between regions 
however  significant variations between regions do not tend to persist long term because of rig mobility 
consequently  we operate in a single  global offshore drilling market 
prospects for our semisubmersible rigs continue to be robust 
increasing demand and limited availability have continued to drive dayrates higher 
we believe that improving market conditions will continue into as development drilling commences on a number of major oil discoveries  particularly in the deepwater markets 
we believe increasing demand coupled with a limited ability to increase rig supply will result in continuing strong 
table of contents dayrates 
we continue to monitor the potential effect of prospective newbuild semisubmersible rigs and drillships  which could have an adverse impact on our utilization and dayrates 
we expect the outlook for activity in the jackup market sector to continue to remain strong due to the current rig supply shortage and the expansion of both domestic and international drilling programs by our customers 
in response to the improved rate environment that has existed in the us gulf of mexico since  we have reactivated a number of idle jackup rigs in our us gulf of mexico fleet and currently have all of our available rigs under contract 
despite recent declines in natural gas prices  and aided by the positive impact of redeployment of rigs from the us gulf of mexico to international markets  we expect to remain at or near full utilization for our jackup rigs in the near term 
however  we continue to monitor the potential effect of approximately newbuild jackups for the global market  which have scheduled delivery dates from through the addition of rig capacity to the market could have an adverse impact on our utilization and dayrates 
during  we experienced high levels of activity for our land rigs and e p services  particularly in latin america  which resulted in higher pricing and utilization 
we expect this trend to continue with further improvements in at the same time  however  we are actively pursuing options for maximizing the value of our latin america land and e p services operations 
all options are being considered  including sales to strategic buyers and capital market alternatives 
we may ultimately decide to pursue a course of action other than a disposition of these operations  however  if we do pursue a disposition  we may be unable to complete a transaction  including through capital market alternatives  on terms we find acceptable or at all 
increased activity in the oilfield services industry is increasing competition for experienced oilfield workers resulting in higher labor costs and training costs 
the increased activity has also increased demand for oilfield equipment and spare parts  resulting in longer order lead times to obtain critical spares and higher repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  as a result of the significant insurance losses incurred to offshore oilfield equipment  including drilling rigs  during the and hurricane season  our insurance costs will increase significantly after the end of our current policy period in june in addition  underwriters have imposed an aggregate limit for damage due to named wind storms in the us gulf of mexico 
however  due to higher dayrates  we expect our growth in revenues to continue to outpace our cost increases in critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other information and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and  accordingly  these estimates may change as additional information is obtained  as more experience is acquired  as our operating environment changes and as new events occur 
our critical accounting estimates are important to the portrayal of both our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make difficult  subjective or complex assumptions or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we would report different amounts in our consolidated financial statements  which could be material  if we used different assumptions or estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for property and equipment  income taxes and contingent liabilities discussed below  however  as discussed in the amendment to our annual report on form k a for the year ended december   we made a material change in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates for certain interest rate swap and cap agreements 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we determine the carrying value of these assets based on property and equipment policies which incorporate our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to the carrying value  remaining useful lives and salvage value of our rigs 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives of our rigs reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of estimated useful lives  especially those involving our rigs  would likely result in materially different net book values of our property and equipment and results of operations 
useful lives of rigs and related equipment are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including technological advances that impact the methods or cost of oil and natural gas exploration and development  changes in market or economic conditions and changes in laws or regulations affecting the drilling industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our rigs when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the rig and include changes in operating condition  functional capability and market and economic factors 
we also consider major capital upgrades required to perform certain contracts and the long term impact of those upgrades on the future marketability when assessing the useful lives of individual rigs 
we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or assets in a specific geographical region 
however  the drilling  workover and related service industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  under utilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  most of our assets are mobile  and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the assets being evaluated to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and dayrates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount is not recoverable 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets and could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we provide income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates and methods of computing taxable income vary substantially in each jurisdiction 
our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre tax income fluctuates 
the determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our levels of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year 
while our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined 

table of contents current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year  withholding taxes  changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed  or from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reflected on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are determined to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and certain assumptions regarding future taxable income  including where the rigs are expected to be deployed  as well as other assumptions related to our future tax position 
a change in such estimates and assumptions  along with any changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets  liabilities  or valuation allowances as discussed below 
as of december   we had a us deferred tax asset of million relating to million of us net operating loss nol carryforwards 
due to our acquisition of marine drilling companies in september  certain nol carryforwards are subject to limitations under sections and of the us internal revenue code 
the us nol carryforwards could expire starting in through we have a foreign deferred tax asset of million relating to million of foreign nol carryforwards 
these foreign nol carryforwards include million that do not expire and million that could expire starting in through we have recognized a valuation allowance on substantially all of these foreign nol carryforwards 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol carryforwards 
we provide a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets in certain taxing jurisdictions because the benefits of the nol carryforwards will be realized only if we enter into additional profitable contracts in those jurisdictions 
we have established a valuation allowance against the potential future tax benefit of a portion of our nol carryforwards and could be required to record an additional valuation allowance if market conditions within certain tax jurisdictions deteriorate and future earnings do not meet our current expectations 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign controlled subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
if a distribution is made to us from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
because we cannot predict when  if at all  we will make a distribution of these unremitted earnings  we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
as required by law  we file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and examination by various tax authorities within the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are currently contesting several tax assessments and may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error 
we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of existing or future tax assessments  however  we believe the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax assessments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe that it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among other things  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have been appropriate  however  past experience is only a guide and the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to litigation  personal injury claims and potential tax assessments see income taxes above 
revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent 
table of contents liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required and would be recognized in the period the new information becomes known 
accounting for interest rate swap and cap agreements we use derivatives in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we have not designated our interest rate swap and cap agreements as hedging instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  we must determine the fair value of these agreements and record any changes to the fair value in our consolidated statements of operations 
the determination of the fair value is complex and requires significant judgments and estimates  including the methodology of building a forward yield curve  the basis of discounting projected future cash flows and varying conventions in contract terms 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different fair values and could materially affect our results of operations 
segment review the following table summarizes our average daily revenues and percentage utilization by type of offshore rig in our fleet for the years ended december average daily average daily average daily revenues utilization revenues utilization revenues utilization eastern hemisphere drillships semisubmersibles jackups tenders and barges western hemisphere semisubmersibles jackups platforms barges us gulf of mexico jackups platforms average daily revenues are based on total revenues for each type of rig divided by actual days worked by all rigs of that type 
average daily revenues will differ from average contract dayrate due to billing adjustments for any non productive time  demobilization fees  mobilization fees  performance bonuses and charges to the customer for ancillary services 
utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days in the period of determination 
eastern hemisphere as of june   our eastern hemisphere segment comprised two ultra deepwater drillships  five semisubmersible rigs  five jackup rigs  three tender assisted rigs  one swamp barge rig  land rigs and two rigs managed for other parties 
drillships 
we have a ownership interest in the joint venture that owns two ultra deepwater drillships  the pride africa and the pride angola 
the pride africa and pride angola are both working under long term contracts that expire in january and june  respectively 
as a result  we are not able to take advantage of increased dayrates in the current market 
in addition  the pride angola was out of service for approximately days during the second quarter of undergoing its five year special periodic survey 

table of contents semisubmersibles 
as began  all of our semisubmersibles were under contract and  due to the strengthening market in this segment  we mobilized the pride south seas from mexico to south africa in the first quarter of the rig started a contract in july  following its special periodic survey  and is contracted through february after that contract expires  it is to be mobilized to west africa for work under a contract with an initial term expiring in july at substantially increased dayrates 
the customer for the pride south seas has an option to extend the contract until january under the same terms 
in the third quarter of  the pride north america completed its commitment with a previous customer and was mobilized to the mediterranean sea for a two year contract beginning in january at substantially higher dayrates 
the rig was idle for days in the first quarter of while experiencing mechanical difficulties with its subsea control system 
after completion of repairs to the subsea control system  the rig resumed normal operations in late april the pride north sea completed its contract in february and entered the shipyard to complete its special periodic survey 
following the special periodic survey  the rig began working in april on a series of contracts  with options  in the mediterranean sea at increased dayrates expected to be completed by july the pride south pacific was out of service for approximately days during the second quarter of to undergo its five year special periodic survey  after which the rig began working offshore west africa on a series of contracts through march the pride venezuela completed its contract in january and entered into a one well contract in the mediterranean sea that expired in may the rig is currently in the shipyard to complete its special periodic survey and upgrades 
the pride venezuela  following its shipyard work  will mobilize to west africa for an month contract  with a six month option  at substantially higher dayrates 
jackups 
the market for jackups in the eastern hemisphere continued to improve during due to strong demand 
we believe that the markets will continue to stay strong in  however  competitors have mobilized additional jackups into the middle east  west africa and southeast asia markets and there are approximately newbuild jackups to be delivered in through which we believe will likely be marketed in these regions 
the pride montana and the pride north dakota are operating offshore saudi arabia under three year contracts expiring in june and may  respectively 
the customer for the pride montana and the pride north dakota holds one year and two years of options  respectively  for these rigs at moderate dayrate increases 
the pride pennsylvania is working offshore india under a contract expiring in september  after which it is to begin a three year contract at substantially higher dayrates 
the pride cabinda is working offshore angola under a renewed contract with a moderately increased dayrate through october the pride hawaii is operating offshore southeast asia under a series of contracts that expire in january  after which it is to be mobilized to offshore india to operate under a contract that expires in april in the first quarter of  we sold the pride rotterdam  an accommodation unit that had been working in the north sea under a contract that expired in march  for approximately million 
we sold the pride ohio in the first quarter of tenders and barges 
the market for tenders and barges improved during after a delay due to civil disruption  the pride ivory coast started its new contract in march  which is set to expire in august the alligator is working in west africa under a contract that expires in june the barracuda completed its contract that expired in march  after which it began a new contract at an increased dayrate that expires in december the bintang kalimantan completed its contract in march and is now available 
we sold the piranha and the ile de sein in managed rigs 
we provide labor and management services for the kizomba a and kizomba b deepwater platform drilling rigs operating offshore angola under management contracts that expire in and  respectively 
land based rigs 
our land based rigs include five rigs in chad  two in kazakhstan  one in russia  one in belgium and one in pakistan 
all but one of the rigs in kazakhstan  the rig in belgium and the rig in russia are currently under contract 
we expect to mobilize the idle kazakhstan rig to colombia during the second half of western hemisphere as of june   our western hemisphere segment comprised seven semisubmersible rigs  jackup rigs  three platform rigs  two lake barge rigs and two managed rigs 

table of contents semisubmersibles 
while the current western hemisphere market for intermediate water depth semisubmersible rigs is strengthening  we have experienced stronger demand in the eastern hemisphere 
as a result  we mobilized the pride venezuela to libya in the fourth quarter of and the pride south seas to south africa in the first quarter of the pride rio de janeiro and the pride portland  of which we own through a joint venture  began operating under five year contracts in brazil 
the pride rio de janeiro commenced working under its contract in november following the completion of a one well contract  and the pride portland commenced working under its contract in october we have also entered into two year contract extensions at higher effective dayrates for the pride carlos walter and the pride brazil for their contracts previously scheduled to be completed in june and july  respectively 
the pride carlos walter is expected to be in the shipyard for its special periodic survey in the third quarter of the pride brazil completed its special periodic survey in the first quarter of the pride south atlantic is under contract for work through december on well to well contracts with various customers at increasing dayrates  following a planned life enhancement project  and the pride south america and the pride mexico are contracted through february and april  respectively 
during the second quarter of  the pride south america was out of service for approximately days for its planned maintenance and regulatory survey and the pride carlos walter and pride south atlantic had a combined days of unscheduled downtime for maintenance 
jackups 
while the contracts for jackup rigs in the mexican sector of the gulf of mexico tend to be longer in duration than those in the us gulf of mexico  the pricing during was strongly correlated with pricing in the us gulf of mexico 
as a result  contracted rates in the western hemisphere increased throughout and have continued to improve in in july  the pride texas began working in mexico under a two year contract which expires in july the pride california completed its current contract in june upon completion of the contract  the pride california is scheduled to begin a one year contract in september at substantially higher rates following a planned life enhancement project 
in the fourth quarter of  we mobilized the pride alaska and the pride oklahoma to the us gulf of mexico 
the pride tennessee  which was operating under a contract scheduled to expire in june  was removed from service in november and is expected to be in the shipyard for repairs and life enhancement upgrades through november the contract with the customer was terminated in april 
the remaining jackups operating in the western hemisphere segment are operating under contracts that expire in late or later 
five of our jackups are scheduled for special periodic surveys  repairs and life enhancement projects during the second and third quarters of platforms 
platform rigs e  e and e  operating in mexico  began new contracts in the at dayrates similar to or higher than the dayrates provided for in their previous contracts 
these contracts expire in mid barges 
the pride i and pride ii lake barges in venezuela are operating under interim agreements on a well to well basis 
managed rigs 
the wells being drilled by the gp and gp have been completed and both rigs are being prepared for final delivery to the owner of the rigs 
us gulf of mexico as of june   our us gulf of mexico segment comprised jackup rigs and nine platform rigs 
we also manage the drilling operations for two high specification deepwater platform rigs  the holstein and the mad dog  under contracts that expire in april and september  respectively  and one semisubmersible rig  thunderhorse  under a contract that expires in april during  demand for drilling services in the us gulf of mexico continued to improve  resulting in higher revenues and earnings from operations 
our us gulf of mexico operations were impacted by hurricane ivan in and hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september of in  we recorded approximately million of costs for damage to a platform rig sustained during hurricane ivan 
after further assessment of the damaged rig  we recorded an additional million impairment charge in the third quarter of related to the damage 
during the third quarter of  hurricanes katrina and rita forced the evacuation of our rigs and caused only minor damage to platform rig

the market for jackups in the us gulf of mexico has been significantly impacted by strong demand combined with a supply shortage  in part resulting from severe damage and total losses of drilling rigs caused by two major hurricanes in the region in and the redeployment of a number of jackups to international markets 
in response to the improved rate environment that has existed in the us gulf of mexico since the third quarter of  we have reactivated our idle jackup rigs in our us gulf of mexico fleet and currently have all of our available rigs under contract  including the pride wyoming and pride utah  which returned to work in april and june  respectively 
the pride wyoming was operating under a contract that expired in march  after which it began a series of contracts expected to be completed by september the pride utah is under contract until august in addition  we mobilized the pride oklahoma and the pride alaska to the area in the fourth quarter of the pride alaska began a new contract in the fourth quarter of and is currently contracted for work in the us gulf of mexico through august the pride oklahoma is currently in the shipyard undergoing repairs and life enhancement upgrades  which are expected to be completed in august  after which it will commence operations under a contract that expires in february the remaining jackups operating in the us gulf of mexico are operating under contracts that expire in the third quarter of or later 
due to supply shortages in the gulf of mexico  many operators are seeking multiple well or longer time commitments 
in response to these requests  we have entered or plan to enter into one year contracts for six jackup rigs which are indexed to current market rates 
platforms 
we currently have four of our platform rigs working under short term or well to well contracts 
despite the strong market performance of jackups in the us gulf of mexico  the platform rig segment did not show significant improvement in utilization during  and we do not expect significant improvement in utilization in the market for platform rigs differs from the jackup rig market because platform rigs require an extended time period for installation over a well 
latin america land as of june   our latin america land segment comprised land drilling and workover rigs operating in argentina  bolivia  colombia  mexico and venezuela 
during  we experienced increased utilization of our land based rigs  particularly in colombia and venezuela 
we also experienced increased dayrates in argentina  venezuela and colombia 
in the first quarter of  we exited the market in brazil through the sale of the three rigs operating in that country 
e p services we provide a variety of services to exploration and production companies in argentina  bolivia  brazil  colombia  ecuador  mexico  peru and venezuela through our e p services segment  including cementing  stimulation  fracturing  coil tubing  directional drilling  under balanced drilling  nitrogen injection  carbon dioxide  production services and fishing services 
we also manage integrated services projects in argentina and other south american countries 
during  we experienced a high level of business activity 
during  we plan to concentrate on higher margin businesses  so we expect our growth in revenues may decrease 
in addition  during we began to exit the market in colombia by transferring equipment to venezuela and argentina  where the market is more favorable 
discontinued operations the operations of the technical services group were concentrated on completing the final of four rigs pursuant to fixed fee contracts to design  engineer  manage construction of and commission specialized drilling rigs for two of our significant customers 
the first rig was completed and delivered in  and the other three rigs were completed and delivered in we experienced significant cost overruns on these projects  and the total costs on each of the four projects substantially exceeded contract revenues 
we do not currently intend to enter into additional business of this nature 
accordingly  we have reported our fixed fee rig construction business as discontinued operations in our results of operations 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for additional information regarding discontinued operations

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased million  or  compared with all operating segments experienced increased revenues as demand for drilling and related services continued to increase 
we moved certain rigs between segments in order to capitalize on potential dayrate increases in certain markets 
despite asset sales and downtime for upgrades and special periodic surveys  the eastern hemisphere revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues from managed platform rigs 
the increase in revenues for the western hemisphere segment was primarily due to higher revenues from its managed rigs 
our us gulf of mexico segment continued to improve its revenues due to higher revenues from managed rigs and improved dayrates and utilization  particularly in the jackup market 
revenues from our latin america land segment increased due to stronger demand and higher utilization and increased pricing 
revenues increased in our e p segment due to increased activity in mexico  brazil and venezuela and a high level of integrated services work in argentina and brazil 
operating costs 
operating costs for increased million  or compared with  primarily due to increased utilization in our latin america land segment driven by stronger demand and increased activity in our e p services segment 
higher labor costs for oilfield personnel also contributed to the increase in operating costs  as the competition for experienced oilfield workers continued to drive up wages and salaries 
operating costs as a percentage of revenues were and for and  respectively 
this increase results primarily from an increase in the amount of operations performed on managed rigs  as these contracts typically have lower operating margins 
operating costs for the eastern hemisphere segment increased primarily due to increased utilization of the semisubmersible fleet and increased costs from managed platform rigs 
operating costs for our western hemisphere segment increased primarily due to our managed rigs  including the pride rio de janeiro and the pride portland  which commenced operations in operating costs for our us gulf of mexico segment increased primarily due to our managed rigs

during  we sold a jackup rig  two tender assisted barge rigs and six land rigs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for increased million  or  compared with the increase was primarily due to charges of million related to severance in connection with the termination of the employment of various key employees and the retirement of a director  increased audit and professional fees and increased compensation costs due to increased staffing 
we anticipate that we will incur a material amount of expenses for to conduct our ongoing investigation described under fcpa investigation above

income taxes 
our consolidated effective tax rate for was as compared with for the lower rate in compared with was primarily due to debt refinancing charges in that reduced income without a proportional reduction to income taxes  and an increase in taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with low or zero effective tax rates 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in taxable income in high effective tax rate countries  and an increase in us tax on certain foreign earnings 

table of contents minority interest 
minority interest in decreased million  or  compared with primarily due to lower income from our joint venture that owns the pride angola due to it being out of service for approximately days to undergo its special periodic survey and increased interest expense on the joint venture s debt which was refinanced and increased in  partially offset by an increase in minority interest related to the mark to market gains on interest rate swap and cap agreements

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for increased million  or  compared with the increase was primarily due to increased activity offshore mexico in our western hemisphere segment  improved dayrates and utilization of the jackup and platform rig fleets in the us gulf of mexico  improved rig activity in our latin america land segment and the growth of the e p services segment due to increased utilization and pricing driven by stronger demand 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by revenue declines in the eastern hemisphere segment due to the lower dayrates for several semisubmersible rigs that were recontracted at lower rates prior to the market upturn for such rigs  downtime on the drillship the pride africa and four jackups as the rigs underwent their special periodic surveys and upgrades  and the tender assisted rig the pride ivory coast being out of service for the entire year

as of december  and  the carrying amount of the note payable was approximately million and million  respectively 
the note payable is collateralized by the pride south america 
the note payable bears interest at and requires quarterly interest payments 
we have the right to prepay the semisubmersible loan in august off balance sheet arrangement we have a equity interest in a joint venture company that owns two dynamically positioned  deepwater semisubmersible drilling rigs  the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro 
the joint venture company has financed the cost of construction of these rigs through equity contributions and fixed rate notes  with repayment of the notes guaranteed by the united states maritime administration marad 
the notes are non recourse to any of the joint venture owners 
in  we entered into five year contracts for each of the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro to operate in brazil 
in order to obtain use of these semisubmersible drilling rigs  we entered into lease agreements with the joint venture company that require all revenues from the operations of the rigs  less operating costs and a management fee  to be paid to the joint venture companies in the form of lease payments 
in addition  the agreements require the joint venture to provide us with working capital necessary to operate the rigs  to fund capital improvements to the rigs and to fund any cash deficits incurred 
during  we incurred lease expense of million for the two rigs 

table of contents additionally  we recognized revenues from the joint venture of approximately million and million during and  respectively  for managing the rigs prior to commencement of the drilling contracts  which approximated the costs we incurred to provide such management 
in the event that the joint venture company does not generate sufficient funds from operations to finance its costs and its debt service obligations  the joint venture partners would  if they choose to maintain the joint venture  need to advance further funds to the joint venture company since the joint venture company would have no alternative source of funds to allow it to make such payments 
principal and interest payments totaling million are due in we advanced the joint venture company million during for our share of operating costs and debt service payments 
if the joint venture company failed to cover its debt service requirements or otherwise breached the marad financing documents in certain respects  a default would occur under the fixed rate notes guaranteed by marad 
marad would then be entitled to foreclose on the mortgages related to the pride portland and the pride rio de janeiro and take possession of the two rigs 
in this event  the rigs may not be available for us to perform our obligations under the five year contracts described above 
as of december   our investment in the joint venture was approximately million  including capitalized interest of million 
we incorporate by reference in response to this item the information set forth in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
other sources and uses of cash mobilization fees received from customers and the costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one geographic area to another  as well as up front fees to modify a rig to meet a customer s specifications  are deferred and amortized over the term of the related drilling contracts 
these up front fees and costs impact liquidity in the period in which the fees are received or the costs incurred  whereas they will impact our statement of operations in the periods during which the deferred revenues and costs are amortized 
the amount of up front fees received and the related costs vary from period to period depending upon the nature of new contracts entered into and market conditions then prevailing 
generally  contracts for drilling services in remote locations or contracts that require specialized equipment will provide for higher up front fees than contracts for readily available equipment in major markets 
additionally  we defer costs associated with obtaining in class certification from various regulatory bodies in order to operate our offshore rigs 
we amortize these costs over the period of validity of the related certificate 
we expect our purchases of property and equipment for to be approximately million 
these purchases are expected to be used primarily for various rig upgrades in connection with new contracts as contracts expire during the year and other sustaining capital projects 
we anticipate making income tax payments of approximately million to million in we may redeploy additional assets to more active regions if we have the opportunity to do so on attractive terms 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we may review from time to time possible expansion and acquisition opportunities relating to our business segments  which may include the construction of rigs for our fleet 
while we have no definitive agreements to acquire or construct additional equipment  suitable opportunities may arise in the future 
any determination to construct additional rigs for our fleet will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  including the availability of long term contracts with sufficient dayrates for the rigs and the relative costs of building new rigs with advanced capabilities versus the costs of retrofitting or converting existing rigs to provide similar capabilities 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition or construction effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  but do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as 
table of contents prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was  million and  million  respectively  which was more than its carrying value as of december  and of  million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
as of december   we held interest rate swap and cap agreements relating to the drillship loan facility as required by the lenders 
we have not designated these interest rate swap and cap agreements as hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the interest rate swap and cap agreements are marked to market with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap and cap agreements was an asset of million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize local currency borrowings and the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we did not enter into any forward exchange or option contracts in and  but continue to monitor our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
