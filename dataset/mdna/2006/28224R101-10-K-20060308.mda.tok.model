executive overview our business our goal is to enable a better way for trusted commerce by delivering risk management  electronic payment and outsourcing solutions that strengthen our customers overall profitability through increased revenues  reduced costs and improved operating efficiency and technology performance 
our principal focus is on issuers of transaction accounts  such as financial institutions  financial services companies  electronic funds networks  retailers  government agencies  telecommunications companies and other businesses 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating results  our management focuses on revenues  operating income  return on invested capital and cash flows 
during the historical periods presented herein  our four principal business lines were electronic payments risk management global outsourcing automated teller machine atm management our most profitable business segments were electronic payments and risk management 
on november   we sold the portfolio of atm machines and merchant contracts the atm portfolio associated with our former atm management segment and entered into a five year master services agreement msa with the buyer 
the atm portfolio represented a significant component of our atm management segment and we have not presented our atm management business as a separate operating segment in periods subsequent to the consummation of this transaction 
pursuant to the msa  we provide processing  residual administration  help desk  cash management and other services to the buyer of the atm portfolio 
the processing service revenues and related costs of the msa have been reported within our electronic payments segment and the atm management service revenues and related costs have been reported within our global outsourcing segment see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amortization of the gain we recognized in connection with this sale is being recorded as a reduction in the operating expenses of our global outsourcing segment over the term of the msa because we do not have sufficient objective and reliable evidence to determine the fair value of the msa and so we concluded that this approach is the only appropriate method of accounting for this arrangement 
in july of  we acquired wildcard systems  inc wildcard 
wildcard provides prepaid products such as gift and payroll cards to financial institutions  retailers and other industry participants 
wildcard provides the processing and ongoing support for all aspects of these programs 
the results of operations of wildcard are reflected in the prepaid solutions component of our electronic payments segment in periods following this acquisition 

table of contents the business model of each of our segments is summarized below 
electronic payments this segment derives its revenue based upon our customers needs to process electronic payment transactions 
the majority of this segment s revenue is derived from processing debit transactions that originate at an atm or point of sale device 
revenues in this segment also reflect processing and other activities associated with prepaid cards such as payroll cards and gift cards following our acquisition of our prepaid solutions business last july 
we also derive revenue in this segment from the provision of electronic benefit transfer ebt services to government agencies 
the remaining revenue from this segment is derived from the licensing  maintenance and support of our electronic funds transfer eft software 
the provision of processing services requires substantial capital investment for computers and related peripherals  maintenance  system modifications and upgrades  security and redundancy 
although these requirements add barriers to competitive entrance  they also create a relatively high ratio of fixed operating costs to total costs 
processors are also required to maintain significant cash reserves to cover temporary differences in the flow of funds associated with electronic funds transfers 
additionally  the software applications used for processing transactions at our data centers and which we license to our software customers are primarily developed in house and frequently require complex network compliance updates and competitive upgrades  creating a dependence upon experienced and qualified information technology it personnel 
the costs we incur for technology improvements are necessary for us to ensure our products are continuously enhanced to provide our customers with up to date processing capabilities 
other operating expenses include telecommunications costs to support the transmission of electronic transactions and settlement 
we focus on increasing the recurring revenue base of this business through  among other things  the retention of our current processing customers and the acquisition of new processing relationships 
increasing our software sales  enhancing and extending our processing capabilities and expanding our processing presence in foreign markets are also areas of management emphasis 
risk management this segment derives its revenue from inquiries from financial institutions and retailers seeking to comply with regulations or mitigate the risk associated with accepting checks  providing credit  engaging in card not present transactions or opening debit accounts for new consumers 
revenue from financial institutions using our new account screening services represents the substantial majority of this segment s revenue 
the balance of the remaining revenue of the segment is derived from retail customers using our check verification and card not present risk management services 
operating costs generally include data acquisition and analytic development costs  the cost of technology  regulatory compliance infrastructure and customer support centers 
our primary efforts in managing this business are directed towards increasing its revenues by improving customer usage rates and expanding our product suite and customer set 
global outsourcing our global outsourcing business derives its revenues from the need of companies to remain competitive by reducing costs while maintaining or improving service levels 
revenues in this segment were derived from a variety of business process outsourcing bpo and information technology services provided to the financial services  retail  telecommunications and government sectors through our us and india based delivery centers 
our bpo services include account acquisition  telesales  credit card and brokerage support  call centers  loan processing  collections  data entry  atm services and systems maintenance 
operating costs in this segment are primarily related to employee expenses and telecommunications and facilities costs 
our principal goal for this business is to expand its customer base in our core target markets of financial services  retail and telecommunications companies 
additionally  we continually pursue opportunities to expand our service offerings to existing customers 
atm management our atm management segment derived its revenues from the use  sale and maintenance of atms 
surcharge and interchange revenue represented the majority of our revenue from this segment in equipment sales were non recurring and  along with branding fees  represented a minority of the revenue in this segment 
operating costs in this segment primarily included processing and telecommunication costs  the cost of the equipment we sold and the residual payments we made to the merchants where the atms we managed were deployed 
we sold our atm portfolio during the fourth quarter of and we no longer treat our atm management activities as a separate operating segment 
key events in we acquired wildcard systems  a leading provider of prepaid solutions

we executed a five year agreement through which we will perform setup  hosting  maintenance and support activities to the united states postal service 
trends our strategic planning and forecasting processes include the consideration of economic and industry wide trends that may impact our business 
we would identify the more material positive and negative trends affecting our business as the following prepaid solution products are experiencing the highest growth rate of any payment card product and this trend is expected to continue over the next several years  although we expect to see some moderation in growth levels seen in this industry in future periods  increased fraud and regulatory requirements are driving a sustained need for risk management products  although the rate of growth in this business is slowing somewhat as many customers and potential customers have already implemented required screening procedures  there continues to be a migration from the use of traditional paper checks and cash to electronic payments  larger financial institutions are developing increasing expectations regarding the ability of their payment technology providers to deliver complex  comprehensive solutions addressing all forms of electronic payment types  there has been an increase in regulatory and legislative activity regarding notice requirements associated with incidents involving the misappropriation of consumer data causing participants in the financial service and other industries to devote additional efforts to maintain the security of their data files  and the use of outsourcing as a means to control costs is driving demand for offshore outsourcing services as well as an increased level of interest in developing expanded offshore capabilities by industry participants and our competitors 
risks and challenges in addition to the trends affecting our industry and company as noted above  we consider risks and challenges that could impact the company s future financial results  including the following and those described at item a in this annual report on form k if the security of our databases is compromised  our reputation could suffer and customers may not be willing to use our products and services 
estimates of future financial results are inherently unreliable 
our ability to expand through acquisitions involves risks and may not be successful 
consolidation in the industries we serve may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
we are unable to predict the results of the purported class action lawsuit filed in florida 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or others may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property 
we face intense competition in all areas of our business  and if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
if we experience system failures  the products and services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted  which could harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 

table of contents legislation or regulation could impair our ability to collect and use data  increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business 
we may experience software defects  development delays and installation difficulties  which could harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 
there are a number of risks associated with our international sales and operations that could harm our business 
changes in india tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
we face termination and compliance risks with respect to our government contracts 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company that you may consider favorable

electronic payments the revenues of our electronic payments segment increased during as compared to due to our acquisition of a prepaid solutions business  the acquisition of new processing customers and an increase in customer reimbursed fees 
we also recognized higher revenues due to increased transaction volumes from our existing customers 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in government services revenues following the expiration of certain customer contracts and lower software license sales 
the following table provides further detail regarding the revenues our electronic payments segment generated from our software business during the periods indicated year ended december  in millions license fees maintenance software services we expect our electronic payments segment revenues to increase substantially in as compared to because we will receive an additional six months of revenues from the prepaid solutions business we acquired last july and due to higher eft processing revenues from new and existing accounts 
we expect to see a somewhat increased level of seasonality in our electronic payments business in the future because the highest level of activity in our prepaid solutions business is typically seen in the fourth quarter of each year due to holiday sales 
software revenues are also expected to improve somewhat over government services revenues are expected to continue to trend lower in electronic payments segment revenues increased during as compared to because of higher eft transaction volumes and a corresponding increase in customer reimbursed fees  an increase in ebt processing revenues from contracts that commenced in  and an increase in software revenues and the fees for software related maintenance and support due to our acquisition of an eft software provider in late risk management the increase in our risk management segment revenues in as compared to is primarily due to growth from acquisitions that we completed in and in the second quarter of and organic growth from our financial institution 
table of contents products 
revenues for our risk management segment are expected to increase in as compared to primarily due to higher revenues from financial institutions 
revenues from our retail products are expected to be generally consistent with the levels seen in the growth in the revenues from our risk management segment in as compared to was due to increased revenues from our chexsystems sm products 
this increase was driven by an increase in inquiries associated with new debit account openings and increased utilization rates by our financial institution customers in response to regulatory requirements 
this growth was somewhat offset by a decrease in revenues from our retail check verification products due to pricing concessions and customer attrition caused by declining check volumes 
global outsourcing our global outsourcing segment revenues increased in as compared to due to the revenues we received for providing atm management services to the buyer of our atm portfolio and our acquisition of india switch company during the second quarter of these increases were offset by lower bpo revenues from a customer that was acquired after the acquiring entity discontinued its use of our services 
it services revenues decreased in as compared to because the shortfall fee we received from our largest it services customer in the fourth quarter of did not recur in global outsourcing segment revenues are expected to decrease in as compared to because the contract with our largest it services customer expires in march and we do not expect it to be renewed 
it services revenues will also be lower because a customer migration project that we completed in will not recur in these declines are expected to be partially offset by an increase in revenues due primarily to our acquisition of isc in mid revenues from our global outsourcing segment increased in as compared to due to increased service volumes and the receipt of a full year of revenue from new customer contracts that originated during the latter half of and in we also recorded a shortfall fee during the fourth quarter of from our largest it services customer because the customer failed to reach certain contractually required minimum spending target levels 
this fee somewhat offset a substantial reduction in the it services revenues we received from this customer in as compared to atm management we have not presented our atm management business as a separate operating segment since the sale of our atm portfolio in november of the revenues we derive from atm management services were reflected in our global outsourcing segment during the decline in revenues from the atm management segment in is primarily due to the sale of our atm portfolio in november of and  to a lesser extent  a general decline in transaction volumes as compared to business segment operating income we revised our segment reporting during the first quarter of to reflect modifications in our cost allocation structure 
operating expenses were reclassified based on an assessment of our technology and overhead costs to realign those costs with the segments that receive the primary benefit from the related resources 
the segment information presented below for has been reclassified to reflect our segment presentation

table of contents the operating income loss by segment for has not been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of operating costs because the segment expenses were maintained in a manual system and it is not practicable to extract the data needed to reclassify these amounts to correspond to the presentation 
in order to provide comparable business segment information  we have presented the business segment operating results for the years ended december  and using the same methodology as was applied in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the k and the impact of the reclassification on the results for contained in the k

if the operating income results for the year ended december  could be reclassified to conform to the presentation  management would expect that the principal factors driving the variations between and would remain unchanged from those identified below 
electronic payments the operating income of our electronic payments segment decreased in as compared to primarily due to additional costs incurred for new client installations  a decline in government services revenues and a reduction in software license sales 
also contributing to the decline in operating income was the allocation of additional operating and overhead expenses to this segment in following the sale of our atm management segment in late the increase in revenues during associated with customer reimbursed fees did not impact our operating income because these fees are recorded as both revenues and corresponding expenses 
operating income from this segment is expected to increase in as compared to due to higher eft processing revenues and prepaid solutions revenues  offset somewhat by an expected continued decline in government services revenues 
the decline in the margins associated with our electronic payments business in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in software development and support costs 
this increase relates to the operational costs associated with the open systems eft software business we acquired in late and our efforts to integrate this software with our legacy software products 
the decline in our electronic payments segment margins in as compared to the prior year is also due to the reversal in of an ebt contract loss reserve which resulted in a non recurring benefit to the segment of approximately million in no such benefit occurred in to the contrary  we recorded a million loss contract charge in the first half of that year 
these declines in margins were partially offset by margin improvements that resulted from processing more eft and ebt transactions using a relatively fixed cost infrastructure 
risk management operating income was higher in as compared to because the increase we saw in revenues from our financial institution suite of products was derived from a relatively fixed cost structure 
the acquisitions we completed in and the second quarter of also contributed to the increase in operating income 
operating income is expected to increase in as compared to as a result of higher financial institution revenues and the acquisitions we completed in the improvement in risk management segment margins in as compared to the prior year was due to the increase in revenues from our chexsystems sm suite of products 
this improvement is also attributable to cost reductions realized through increased utilization of our india operations for contact center and development activities 

table of contents global outsourcing the operating income of our global outsourcing segment decreased in due to the effect of lower it services revenues and reduced shortfall fees from our largest it services customer 
we received million in shortfall fees from this customer in as compared to million in an increase in allocated operating and corporate expenses following the sale of our atm portfolio in also contributed to the decline in operating income in these declines were partially offset by the impact of the managed services agreement we signed with the buyer of our atm portfolio and the customer migration project we completed in operating income from this segment in will be lower than because our largest it services contract will expire in the first quarter of and the customer migration project we completed in will not recur in we will not receive any shortfall fees in an increase in bpo revenues and improved productivity and capacity utilization drove an increase in our global outsourcing segment margins in as compared to this increase in margins was partially offset by a decline in it services revenues 
atm management our atm management business was not presented as a separate operating segment in following the sale of our atm portfolio in november the margins derived from our atm management segment remained relatively consistent during as compared to corporate unallocated corporate overhead includes  among other things  executive leadership costs  investor relations and certain shared legal  consulting  accounting  finance and technology expenses 
the decrease in corporate overhead costs in as compared to is primarily due to a reduction in external consulting costs and the reduction in legal and other related expenses associated with the resolution of an sec investigation and the settlement of the related stockholders litigation 
we expect corporate overhead costs in to be largely flat to those seen in the increase in corporate overhead costs in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in legal and other expenses related to an sec investigation and indemnification obligations associated with its resolution as well as higher expenses incurred to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three years ended december  were as follows year ended december  change dollars in millions operating expenses processing  communication and service costs employee costs depreciation and amortization other operating costs restructuring and other charges contract loss provision reversal total operating expenses represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
processing  communication and service costs this category includes the cost of transaction processing  telecommunications  computer equipment and promotional services 
this category also included the residual payments we made to the occupants of the properties where the atms that we owned or managed prior to the sale of our atm portfolio were located 
the decrease in processing  communication and service costs in is primarily due to the sale of our atm portfolio in late and the impact of the amortization of the deferred gain from that sale 
this decrease was partially offset during the second half of due to the acquisition of our prepaid solutions business 

table of contents processing  communications and service costs are expected to be higher in as compared to due to expected increases in eft processing revenues and the additional costs associated with the prepaid solutions business we acquired in july the decrease in processing  communication and service costs in was primarily due to lower residual payments and other atm operational costs due to the sale of our atm portfolio in late additional cost reductions were realized from greater utilization of our india based resources 
this decline in costs was partially offset by an increase in customer reimbursed fees 
employee costs expenses in this category represent employee compensation  payroll taxes  medical costs and other employee related costs 
employee costs increased in as compared to due to the addition of employees from acquisitions 
company wide headcount increased from  employees at december  to  employees at december  we expect employee costs to increase in as compared to due largely to these acquisitions 
we will begin expensing employee stock options and other equity based awards in which will also result in higher employee costs as compared to the increases in these costs in as compared to were attributable to an increase in our performance based compensation costs  including commissions  as well as an increase in employee headcount in our bpo business 
depreciation and amortization these costs represent the depreciation of the buildings and equipment we own and the amortization of our intangible assets  such as capitalized software costs and acquired contracts 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses in as compared to is due to additional expenses related to the acquisitions we completed during  including wildcard 
because we receive tangible and intangible assets with finite lives when we acquire a company  the depreciation and amortization we record for those assets results in an incremental increase in our costs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization expenses for intangible assets following the sale of our atm portfolio 
depreciation and amortization costs are expected to be higher in than due to additional costs we will incur associated with the acquisitions we completed during the increase in these costs in as compared to was due to additional depreciation and amortization on assets associated with businesses we acquired during the fourth quarter of and during the first half of this increase was partially offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expenses due to the cessation of depreciation on the assets included in the atm portfolio following the execution of the related sales agreement in september other operating costs expenditures in this category include facility costs  professional  consulting and temporary services  bad debt expense and certain administrative costs 
other operating costs increased in as compared to due to an increase in consulting and temporary service costs and additional costs associated with the operations of our acquisitions 
these higher costs were partially offset by a decline in legal expenses following the settlement of an sec investigation and related litigation in as well as a million refund of business and occupancy state taxes during the second quarter of that we credited against this expense category 
other operating costs are expected to increase in as compared to primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisitions we completed during other operating costs in remained relatively flat with the corresponding expenses incurred in because the increase in costs from legal and other expenses related to the sec investigation and its resolution and the costs incurred to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act were offset by a reduction in certain facility and insurance costs due to cost reduction efforts 
restructuring and other charges during  we initiated a significant effort to reduce our cost structure by eliminating unprofitable product lines  improving our internal business processes and increasing the utilization of our india based resources 
these measures resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in that year 
during  we reversed million of lease related charges that we recorded in to reflect the successful subletting of a portion of the properties subject to those leases 
due to the business process improvement initiatives identified during  we recorded restructuring charges for severance benefits of million 
we also recorded a million charge for the write off of in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of a developer of transaction processing software in late during  
table of contents we incurred severance charges of approximately million related to the elimination of approximately positions 
these charges are expected to be paid through we did not record any restructuring charges in contract loss provision reversal during the second quarter of  we recorded a million loss contact charge for certain fixed long term software contracts that we determined were unlikely to be profitable 
in  we recorded a million benefit related to a reduction in our estimate of future losses on certain government ebt contracts 
actual results on the government ebt contracts were better than previously estimated due to higher than expected case counts and cost savings 
the projects related to our contract loss provisions have been completed and we have no outstanding loss contract reserve balance at december  other income net other income net primarily includes interest and investment income and foreign currency translation adjustments 
income earned on cash  cash equivalents and investments was million in  million in and million in we incurred an expense in and from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates of million and million  respectively 
the impact from changes in foreign currency rates during was insignificant 
we are considering whether to enter into hedging arrangements to limit our exposure to unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is largely determined by our indian subsidiary s proportional share of our projected consolidated income 
our indian software development and bpo operations qualify for tax incentives associated with businesses that operate within designated geographic locations in india 
these incentives generally provide us with exemptions from indian income tax on certain business income generated from these operations and phase out through march our annualized effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the significant decrease in our effective tax rate during reflects a million tax benefit primarily from an advanced pricing agreement that we signed with the internal revenue service in august related to our foreign operations 
as a result of this agreement  certain tax reserves that we had previously created were no longer considered necessary and we reduced our tax provision to reflect their reversal 
also contributing to the decline in our effective tax rate during was our recognition of a million tax benefit during the first quarter of from our release of tax reserves related to our foreign operations because certain tax rulings indicated that these reserves were no longer needed 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions change cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term debt due within one year long term debt stockholders equity net working capital represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
financial condition our cash balance  cash flows and credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to meet our recurring operating commitments and to fund planned capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents at december  included cash in india of approximately million 
the funds in india are held in india bank accounts denominated in india rupees or us dollars 
these funds are available for use in our india operations and investments 
under the american jobs creation act of the act  we had the opportunity to receive a special one time tax deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings during  but we elected not to do so 
as part of our transaction processing business  we provide cash settlement services to financial institutions and state and local governments 
these services involve the movement of funds between the various parties associated with atm  point of sale or ebt transactions and this activity results in a balance due to us at the end of each business day that we recoup over the next few business days 
the balances due to us are included in cash and cash equivalents 
the typical overnight settlement balance due to us ranges from million to million 
we plan to satisfy these liquidity requirements using cash and cash 
table of contents equivalents on hand as well as through the revolving credit agreement described below 
as of december   approximately million was due to us and we received these funds in early january 
historically  we have sought to maintain adequate cash balances and credit facilities to ensure that we could advance funds to one of our processing customers if unusual circumstances prevented us from processing this customer s settlement files on time 
in january of  we renegotiated the terms of this arrangement and are no longer obligated to advance funds to this customer under these circumstances  although the renegotiated contract terms do require us to reimburse the customer for any additional fees that the customer might incur if we are unable to process its settlement files in a timely manner 
the impact from such an event would not be material to our financial position or results of operations

operating activities our primary source of operating cash flow is the profits we generate from our business 
operating cash outflows include payments to vendors for telecommunications services  consulting services and supplies 
we also pay salaries and benefits to our employees and income taxes 
cash flows provided by operations decreased to million in as compared to million in primarily due to the payment of income taxes related to the sale of our atm portfolio and lower accounts receivable collection rates at acquired companies and our international businesses 
the sale of the atm portfolio also contributed to these lower collection rates because that business had rapid rate of turnover for its accounts receivable 
although our business generated more gross profits in  our cash flows declined as compared to because we paid million in incentive bonuses in whereas we did not pay incentive bonuses in cash flows from our operations were also reduced by an increase in our accounts receivable balance due to an increase in our international operations  which have historically had a longer collection cycle

table of contents payments due by period in millions total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations vendor obligations total future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases are presented net of minimum sublease rentals of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase orders for goods and services are not included in this table because they may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
these orders are based upon our current service needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within one or two months 
we are party to certain other contracts with third parties whereby the third party provides services to us 
these services are operational in nature and our obligations under these contracts vary from period to period based on our utilization of the services 
these commitments are not reflected in the table above as the associated amounts are not currently determinable 
the following table sets forth our future commercial commitments as of december  commitment expiration by period in millions total thereafter letters of credit and other performance bonds total commitments amounts may not sum due to rounding 
in connection with our government services business and collection activities  we post surety bonds with state agencies guaranteeing our performance of certain obligations related to the relevant contracts or state requirements 
the aggregate amount of such bonds outstanding at december  was million 
we also had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees in india as of such date 
these obligations were secured by time deposits in an equivalent amount 
hedging activities on july   we entered into an interest rate related derivative instrument to manage the exposure we had to variations in interest rates pending the anticipated issuance of the million of notes described above 
the notes have a fixed interest rate that was based on the seven year interpolated rate on federal treasury securities plus a credit spread  and so we were exposed to variability in the future interest payments on the notes if treasury note rates changed prior to the completion of the notes offering 
the notional amount of the derivative was million and its scheduled maturity date was three months from the date of its execution 
on september   we unwound the derivative instrument when we locked the interest rate on the notes and  due to changes in treasury rates during the derivative instrument s term  we paid million to settle this arrangement 
the derivative instrument we entered into was effective and qualified for hedge accounting and so the loss we incurred in connection with it was deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized as incremental interest expense in our income statement over the seven year term of the notes 
we did not have any derivative instruments at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  reserves and allowances  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and considerations used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our net revenues consist primarily of fees for transaction processing and related services including government benefit distribution  prepaid card services  software licensing and related services  risk management services  and business process outsourcing and information technology consulting services 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
these criteria are applied to each accounting unit identified within an arrangement 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgments about vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  collectibility of fees and projections of costs to complete projects for our customers 
we frequently enter into contracts to provide multiple products and services multiple elements 
we evaluate contracts with multiple elements to determine if the elements can be divided into more than one unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
an item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items which do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
if we have established the fair value for all units of accounting within a multiple element arrangement  the total consideration associated with that arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in arrangements where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of only the undelivered items  we use the residual method of revenue recognition to allocate the total consideration derived from the arrangement 
under the residual method of revenue recognition  the total arrangement value is allocated to the undelivered element based on its fair value and the remaining value of the contract is allocated to the delivered element 
transaction processing and related services transaction processing and service fees  including government benefit distribution fees  are recognized in the period that the service is rendered 
these services typically consist of processing customers electronic debit transactions and settling the funds with the financial institutions involved in the transactions 
transaction processing and service fees are charged on a per transaction basis  depending on the contractual arrangement with the customer 
government services fees are recognized in the period services are rendered based on monthly fees per benefits recipient 
prepaid solutions we receive fees from prepaid and stored value card transactions through the provision of transaction processing services  program and account set up services  card origination and other professional services 
we recognize revenues for transaction processing fees as described above 
fees for program and account set ups and related professional services are recognized over the economic life of the cards related to the program because these services do not have stand alone value to the customer 
all other card service revenue is recognized when services are rendered 
software licensing and related services software license fees for standard products are recognized upon delivery of the software or  for electronic deliveries  when the customer takes possession of the software via a download or has been provided with access codes that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware 
if a license contains customer acceptance criteria for which significant uncertainties exist  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or satisfaction of the contractual customer acceptance criteria 
certain software licensing arrangements include multiple elements 
we generally allocate the total consideration from these types of arrangements using the residual revenue recognition methodology 
the fair value of the undelivered elements under this methodology is determined using the sales price of each undelivered element when sold separately vendor specific objective evidence 

table of contents from time to time  we enter into arrangements that require significant modification  customization or production of software we license to others 
we typically will charge separate fees for the software license and for the professional services associated with the software s customization 
in these circumstances  the total license fee and service fees are recognized proportionately with the percentage of completion of the project 
the percentage of completion of the project is typically determined using the expended method 
this method measures progress toward completion using the actual labor hours or days incurred compared to the total estimated number of hours or days required to complete the project 
these estimates are subject to revision as the projects progress towards completion 
revisions to these estimates that result in a material impact to our results of operations or financial position are recorded in the periods in which we determine that a revision is probable and the revision value can be reasonably estimated 
we typically bill customers in advance for software maintenance services 
revenues associated with these services are recognized ratably over the service period 
professional service revenues related to installed copies of our software are recognized as the related services are rendered 
risk management services risk management fees are recognized as revenue in the period the services are rendered 
risk management services consist of new account applicant and check verification screenings to manage the risk associated with account openings  check acceptance and card not present transactions 
risk management fees are based on the number of inquiries against the databases used for screening purposes or monthly fees based on the net monthly sales of the user of our products or other similar measures  depending on the product and service 
business process outsourcing and information technology consulting services we provide business process outsourcing and information technology consulting services 
revenue from providing these services is generally recognized under one of two methods  depending on the relevant contractual terms 
under the time and materials method  which is applied to a significant portion of our contracts  revenues are based on a fee per hour or transaction basis and are recognized as hours or transactions are completed 
under the fixed contract method  which represents only a very small portion of our revenues  a pre set fee is agreed upon for a project and revenue is recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project using the expended method described above 
intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  capitalized software costs and acquired contracts 
goodwill when we acquire other companies  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that we make estimates regarding the fair value of the acquired company s tangible assets and liabilities and its identifiable intangible assets 
based upon these estimates  we then allocate the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company for the purpose of recording these items in our financial records 
any unallocated portion of the purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the distinction between the amount of the purchase price allocated either to tangible assets and liabilities or identifiable intangible assets and goodwill is significant because goodwill is not amortized to our income statements but is instead subject to an annual impairment test 
estimates inherent in the process of this purchase price allocation include assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  the salability of inventories  selection of discount rates  contract renewal rates and general market conditions 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in making these estimates 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment  to determine if the goodwill we have recorded in respect of our reporting segments is impaired 
if changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment of our recorded goodwill  we compare the fair value of the segment to its carrying value  including its associated goodwill 
the carrying value of the segment includes an allocation of those corporate assets and liabilities that have not been specifically identified with the segment  based upon its pro rata percentage of our total net revenue 
we primarily rely on the income method to determine a segment s fair value 
this valuation approach uses estimates of the segment s future revenue and costs and a discount rate based upon the estimated weighted average cost of capital for that segment 
our estimates of a segment s future cash flows are based upon historical data  various internal estimates and external sources 
we develop these estimates as part of our routine long term strategic planning 
we test the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying our discounted cash flow analysis by using comparable market data to the extent it is available 
we have not recorded an impairment in the goodwill of our segments in the past 

table of contents software internal use we capitalize the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use once the preliminary project stage has been completed  management commits to funding the project  it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project and interest costs incurred  when material  while developing internal use software 
capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we assess internal use software for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recovered 
for example  in we discontinued certain product lines which resulted in a charge of approximately million for the impairment of the related software 
there have been no subsequent impairment charges for internal use software 
software licensing and resale we capitalize the cost of software developed for licensing and resale once its technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized costs are amortized on a product by product basis normally over three years and no longer than five years 
software developed for resale is carried at the lesser of its amortized cost or net realizable value 
although we have never recorded an impairment charge for software developed for resale  these capitalized costs could be impaired if the net realizable value of that software became less than its net book value 
such an impairment could occur if our sales of that software declined significantly 
acquired contracts and other contracts acquired through acquisitions are specifically identified in connection with that acquisition 
the amount recorded as intangible assets for acquired contracts represents the estimated fair value of these relationships 
this estimate is based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from the contracts  including expected renewals 
the majority of these intangibles are amortized using a straight line basis 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in determining the fair value and amortizable life of contracts at the time of their acquisition 
this type of intangible asset could be impaired if the attrition rate associated with the acquired contracts materially exceeds the rate used to estimate the fair value of the acquired contract portfolio 
to date  we have not incurred any significant impairments with regard to our acquired contracts 
other intangibles also include miscellaneous assets obtained in connection with the acquisition of other companies  typically non competition agreements 
non competition agreements are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and amortized ratably over the period of the non competition agreement 
we assess acquired contracts and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimates of how often our customers will fail to make their required payments 
we develop this allowance based on our experience with specific customers  our understanding of their current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of their ultimate payment 
we also consider our collection experience with the balance of our receivables portfolio and make estimates regarding collectibility based on trends in aging 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  thereby impairing their ability to make payments  an increase in this allowance could be required in a future period 
such an increase would reduce our income 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to make significant judgments to estimate our future income taxes 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we will realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of our valuation allowances  the rates to be used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries and the valuation models to be used for measuring the value of certain transactions 
further  our operations are governed by and subject to government regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to taxation and the judgments and estimates we use are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
we 
table of contents recognize tax liabilities when we believe that they are probable of being incurred and we can reasonably estimate their amount 
it is possible that either foreign or domestic taxing authorities could challenge our judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause us to incur tax liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
we currently expect that it is more likely than not that our future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested and  accordingly  we have not provided for us federal  state income or applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  upon any distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and applicable withholding taxes payable to the foreign countries 
the american jobs creation act of provided us with the opportunity to receive a special one time tax deduction on the repatriation of certain of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries during  but we elected not to undertake any such repatriation 
stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees under the terms of the efunds corporation stock option plan 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap provide two alternative methods of accounting for stock options issued under the terms and conditions that we typically issue them 
one alternative is to estimate the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant and amortize that value as an expense to operations over the contractual vesting period 
the other option currently available to companies reporting under gaap is to estimate the fair value of the option at the grant date  but only reflect the impact of the amortization in a footnote to the financial statements and to forgo adjusting the statement of operations 
the method a company chooses to apply is a matter of policy 
consistent with our past practices  we currently utilize the second of these options and we reflect the impact of option amortization in the footnotes to our financial statements 
as illustrated in note to the financial statements  were we to change our accounting policy on this matter to reflect option expense in our statements of income  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize would change if the underlying assumptions used to estimate it were to change 
for instance  we would expect the expense to decrease if the expected life of the option or the volatility of our stock price were to decrease 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently revised the current applicable accounting pronouncements related to accounting for stock options to require us to reflect our option expense in our statements of income no later than the first quarter of see the discussion below regarding sfas no 
r under recent accounting pronouncements 
disposition of atm portfolio on november   we consummated an agreement the agreement to sell the atm portfolio previously associated with our atm management segment 
concurrently with the consummation of the sale of the atm portfolio  we entered into a five year atm master services agreement msa with the buyer 
pursuant to the msa  we are providing the buyer with transaction processing  residual administration  cash and telecommunications management  help desk and other atm management services 
the atm portfolio represented a significant portion of the atm management segment and we ceased presenting this business as a separate operating segment following its sale 
the services provided in accordance with the msa are presented within our remaining segments with processing service revenues and related costs being recorded within the electronic payments segment and revenues from atm management services and related costs reported within the global outsourcing segment 
the operating results of the atm portfolio have not been presented as discontinued operations because we have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the asset group through the msa 
the major asset categories and related carrying amounts sold and disposed of included net accounts receivable of million  net property and equipment of million  goodwill of approximately million  net other intangible assets of approximately million  other current assets of approximately million and accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately million 
we incurred approximately million of costs in connection with the transaction that primarily consisted of professional service fees 

table of contents the amounts received by us in connection with the agreement exceeded the book value of the atm portfolio by approximately million 
in considering the appropriate method for accounting for the excess proceeds from this arrangement  we considered the analogous authoritative accounting literature 
the most directly applicable pronouncement was considered to be emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf indicates that in arrangements with multiple elements that are deemed to be in substance one arrangement  any income or gain associated with the arrangement should be deferred and recognized over the period of the remaining obligations unless there is sufficient  objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered contractual elements 
we consider the atm portfolio sale and the msa to be components of a single arrangement because these transactions were negotiated simultaneously without regard to their individual economic characteristics 
although both factual and anecdotal evidence was considered  we were unable to determine the fair value of the msa with a reasonable degree of certainty due to  among other things  the uniqueness of that contract  the lack of similar arrangements in the industry and because the contractual cash flows expected to be generated by the msa are not representative of the contract s intrinsic fair value absent the compensating benefits associated with the entirety of the arrangement represented by the atm portfolio sale and the msa 
due to the lack of sufficient  objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the msa  we determined that the only appropriate method of accounting for the arrangement was to defer the entirety of the implied gain from the transactions and amortize this amount as a reduction in the other operating costs of our global outsourcing segment over the period of the remaining undelivered elements of the obligations of the arrangement the initial five year term of the msa 
at december   approximately million of the implied gain was recorded as a deferred gain of which million was recorded as current liabilities and the remainder is included in long term liabilities 
approximately million of the deferred gain was recognized as a reduction in the global operating segment s other operating costs during in the event the msa is terminated early and our services thereunder are discontinued  the entire unamortized deferred gain would be recognized

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally and are subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as our business evolves and could have positive or negative impacts on our financial results 
we had not entered into any derivative instruments or hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to adverse foreign currency rate changes as of december   although we may do so in the future 
currently  we receive non us dollar denominated revenues and incur non us dollar denominated operating expenses primarily in the united kingdom  india and canada 
we also have assets located in these countries 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for us are the british pound  indian rupee and canadian dollar 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in these three currencies 
we have prepared sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates on our income before tax for the year ended december  based upon these analyses  we estimate that a adverse change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound  indian rupee and canadian dollar would have reduced our reported income before taxes during by approximately million 
a change in the exchange rate for the british pound  indian rupee and canadian dollar would also have an impact on the foreign net assets reflected in our balance sheet  but we would not expect this change to be material to our total assets 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement
