table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the partnership is a producer and marketer of nitrogen products for use in agricultural and industrial markets 
nitrogen is a commodity chemical and prices are established based on global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide production rates 
to be viable under these market conditions  a producer must be among the low cost producers to markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
high nitrogen margins in led to capacity expansion projects globally that resulted in capacity increases that were  in the short term  substantially greater than demand growth  causing oversupply conditions that reduced nitrogen prices 
since  that new global capacity has been partially offset by demand growth as well as permanent plant closings in the us and europe 
during  the partnership determined that market conditions did not justify the ongoing investment in maintenance and replacement capital necessary to extend operations for the remainder of the established useful life at its blytheville  arkansas facility 
accordingly  the partnership recorded a million charge in as an impairment of long lived assets and permanently halted production at the facility in may during the third quarter of  the blytheville facility was disposed 
the partnership continues to produce nitrogen products at its verdigris  oklahoma facility 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
north american natural gas costs have increased substantially since since the partnership competes with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  the oversupply situation during most of the three years ending december  did not permit the partnership to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this resulted in curtailments of north american nitrogen production 
these curtailments contributed to reductions in global nitrogen product supplies 
the cost of natural gas increased during the third quarter to unprecedented levels due to supply disruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
these increases significantly increased the partnership s production costs and future gross profits realized by the partnership may be lower than realized during in addition  the partnership may curtail or shut down its production facilities if finished goods prices do not increase  or natural gas costs do not decline  to levels allowing the partnership to cover variable production costs 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to the partnership s facilities 
offshore producers are most competitive in regions close to north american points of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast 
the partnership s sales volumes primarily depend upon the operating rates for its plants 
the partnership may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  but historic gross margins on these volumes are rarely significant 
the profitability and cash flows from the partnership s operations 
table of contents are affected by its ability to manage its costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting the partnership s operating results include the number of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during the planting season  grain prices and other variables described in item business and item properties section of this report 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the partnership s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different amounts being reported under different assumptions and conditions 
the partnership s critical accounting policies are described below 
derivatives and financial instruments the partnership accounts for derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period that the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the general partner enters into derivative instruments including future contracts  swap agreements  put and call options to cap or fix prices for a portion of the partnership s natural gas production requirements 
the general partner also uses similar derivative instruments to fix or set floor prices for a portion of the partnership s nitrogen sales volumes 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value 
the partnership performs a monthly analysis of its inventory balances to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value 
the analysis of estimated realizable value is based on customer orders  market trends and historical pricing 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated net realizable value 
production costs include the cost of direct labor and materials  depreciation and amortization  and overhead costs related to manufacturing activities 
the cost of inventories is determined using the first in  first out method 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a transaction exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  no obligations remain and collectibility is probable 
the partnership classifies any discounts and trade allowances as a reduction in revenue 
gains or losses associated with settled nitrogen derivative contracts are classified as revenue 
the partnership classifies amounts paid by customers for shipping and handling as revenue 
impairments of long lived assets the partnership reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
factors that affect operating performance factors that may affect the partnership s operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effects general weather patterns have on the timing and duration of fieldwork for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for the partnership s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products is natural gas 
natural gas costs in accounted for approximately of total costs and expenses for the partnership 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not covered by forward pricing arrangements or recovered through an increase in the price of related nitrogen products would have an adverse effect on the partnership s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a portion of global nitrogen products is manufactured at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  priced substantially lower than the partnership s natural gas 
the partnership employs forward pricing contracts for natural gas to reduce risk from volatile natural gas prices 
in fall   the partnership established a natural gas hedging forward product sales policy to ensure the partnership has either sufficient inventory or forward gas position to support forward product sales obligations 
departures from the policy are permitted with the approval of the general partner s board of directors 
hedging natural gas prices is accomplished through various supply contracts  financial derivatives and other instruments 
the partnership s december  forward positions do not extend beyond and were of the anticipated verdigris facility s natural gas consumption 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that influence food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions and international trade decisions 
for example  demand was reduced  in part  due to relatively high nitrogen prices and low grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the 
table of contents availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
weather can significantly affect demand for the partnership s products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt fieldwork during the planting season may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to the partnership s sales 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could impair their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from the partnership s dealer customers 
conversely  low crop yields often increase the planted areas in the subsequent growing season  which  in turn  increases the demand for nitrogen fertilizer 
the partnership s business is highly seasonal  with the majority of its products used during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which products can be used by customers  the partnership and its customers generally build inventories during the second half of the year to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for its current level of sales  the partnership requires lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the partnership believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
the partnership s operations may be subject to significant interruption if its facility were to experience a major accident or natural disaster 
the partnership currently maintains insurance  including business interruption insurance  which it believes is sufficient to cover major damage to any of its facilities

during  the partnership recorded a million charge for the impairment of blytheville s long lived assets as the partnership s general partner  tnc  concluded that future market conditions may not justify ongoing investment in the maintenance and replacement capital required to operate the blytheville facility for its established useful life 
net interest income improved by million compared with that of due to lower borrowing levels and higher cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership has an arrangement for demand deposits with an affiliate to allow for excess partnership cash to be deposited with terra capital  inc  terra capital the indirect parent of the general partner 
excess partnership cash is received by terra capital and earns interest until the funds can be transferred to partnership accounts for disbursements 
cash balances are transferred to the partnership from terra capital on a weekly basis 
amounts on deposit with terra capital at december  and earned 
table of contents interest at and  which is the rate that terra capital received on its pooled cash investments 
the partnership believes that terra capital and its parent  terra industries inc  have sufficient credit available under its existing borrowing agreements combined with cash on hand to fully fund all obligations to the partnership  upon request 
however  the partnership does have credit risks with deposits held by terra capital in the event of bankruptcy by terra or its subsidiaries 
the partnership may be unable to obtain its funds on demand in such a situation 
during the fourth quarter  the partnership changed its accounting policy concerning classification of cash deposited with terra capital 
the new policy results in the reclassification of deposits with terra capital from cash and cash equivalents to demand deposits with affiliate on the balance sheet and cash flows arising from deposits in and withdrawals from such demand deposits as a cash flows from investing activities 
there was no impact to partners capital or net income as a result of this change 
the partnership believes that presenting the related party deposits in a separate balance sheet caption and presenting related party deposits and withdrawals as an investing activity in the statement of cash flows is preferable because the separate presentation is more consistent with the nature of the deposit  which is subject to credit risk and is not a deposit in a financial institution and more clearly presents the related party nature of the cash management arrangement with terra capital 
although none of the agreements or conditions governing these deposits has changed  the partnership has elected to change the presentation of such deposits to show them as a separate current asset and not as a cash equivalent 
the partnership continues to have the contractual right to withdraw these funds on demand and continues to have the ability to access funds deposited in these accounts on a daily basis 
the partnership may terminate such cash management arrangement at any time 
as required  the change has been applied retroactively by reclassifying all periods presented 
a summary of the effects of the reclassification and change in accounting policy is as follows as previously as previously in thousands reported as reclassified reported as reclassified consolidated balance sheets cash demand deposit with affiliate cash and cash equivalents demand deposit with affiliate consolidated statements of cash flows investing activities changes in demand deposits with affiliate net cash flows from investing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in  a decrease of million principally due to changes in working capital  offset by increased earnings 
working capital changes represented a million decrease to cash flows primarily due to a million decrease in customer prepayments  an million increase in accounts receivable and an million increase in inventory 
customer prepayments at december  were lower than the prior year due to reduced customer demand for such arrangements 
at december   the partnership had received million of customer prepayments that it expects to substantially fulfill during the first half of higher selling prices caused increases in accounts receivable and higher natural gas costs caused increases in finished goods inventory values 
capital expenditures of million during were used primarily to fund replacement and stay in business additions to plant and equipment 
the partnership expects capital expenditures to be approximately million 
contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments  other than notes due to affiliates  were as follows at december  payments due in in thousands thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total the partnership s principal funding needs are to support its working capital and capital expenditures 
the partnership intends to fund its needs primarily from cash provided by operating activities and  to the extent required  from funds borrowed under the partnership s revolving bank credit facility 
on december   the partnership entered into a million revolving bank credit facility that expires in june under the credit facility  the partnership may borrow an amount generally based on eligible cash balances  of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible finished goods inventory  less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   the partnership had million of borrowing availability under this credit facility 
the partnership s borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of its working capital 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under the facility 
management expects the facility to be adequate to meet the partnership s operating cash needs 
under the credit facility  the partnership is subject to the covenants which impose certain limitations on additional debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions  liens  asset sales  investments  prepayments of subordinated indebtedness  changes in lines of business and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  if the partnership s aggregate borrowing availability falls below million  it is required to have generated million of operating cash flows or earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as defined in the credit facility for the preceding four quarters 
the partnership is also required to maintain a minimum aggregate unused borrowing availability of million at all times 
the partnership s ability to continue to meet the covenants under the credit facility in the future will depend on market conditions  operating cash flows  working capital needs  receipt of customer prepayments and trade credit terms 
failure to meet these covenants  or to obtain a waiver from the lenders  would result in a default by the partnership such that all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable and the partnership would be unable to borrow additional amounts under 
table of contents the credit facility 
because access to adequate bank facilities may be critical to funding the partnership s operating cash needs and purchase of financial derivatives to manage the partnership s exposure to natural gas commodity price risk  any default or termination of the joint revolving bank credit facility could have a material adverse effect on the partnership 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
the partnership does not expect its compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
in addition  the partnership incurred million  million and insignificant amounts of capital expenditures in  and  respectively  related to capital improvements to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
the partnership may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
the partnership estimates that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in and beyond will be less than million 
quarterly distributions to tnclp s partners are based on available cash for the quarter as defined in the tnclp agreement of limited partnership 
available cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements  adjusted for changes in certain reserves established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary 
distributions paid to the partners in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
prior to the restructuring of the partnership in the third quarter of  distributions of available cash were made to the limited partners and to the general partner 
subsequent to the restructuring of the partnership  distribution of available cash is made to the limited partners and to the general partner 
an affiliate of the general partner is entitled  as an incentive  to larger percentage interests to the extent that distributions of available cash exceed specified levels 
the specified levels are increased by the amount of quarterly distributions to holders of common units that are less than per unit 
as of december   the cumulative shortfall on quarterly distributions to holders of common units that must be paid before the general partner affiliate receives an incentive payment was million  or per unit 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  inventory costs 
sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities and unallocated overhead costs recognized as an expense in the period incurred 
in addition  other items such as abnormal freight  handling costs and wasted materials require treatment as current period charges rather than a portion of the inventory cost 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during periods beginning after june  the partnership does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  sfas an amendment of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in our first quarter of the partnership does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its results of operation or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error correction sfas which replaces apb opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the earliest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and restatement with respect to the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by the partnership in the first quarter of in march  the fasb issued sfas interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which requires conditional asset retirement obligations to be recognized if a legal obligation exists to perform asset retirement obligations to be recognized if a legal obligation exists to perform asset retirement activities and a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made 
fin also provides guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the partnership adopted the provisions of fin on december  and the adoption did not have a material affect on the partnership s financial statements 
general partner option to effect mandatory redemption of partnership units at december   the general partner and its affiliates owned of the partnership s outstanding units 
when less than of the issued and outstanding units are held by non affiliates of the general partner  as is the case at december   the partnership  at the general partner s sole discretion  may call  or assign to the general partner or its affiliates its right to acquire  all such outstanding units held by non affiliated persons 
if the general partner elects to acquire all outstanding units  the partnership is required to give at least but not more than days notice of its decision to purchase the outstanding units 
the purchase price per unit will be the greater of the average of the previous trading days closing prices as of the date five days before the purchase is announced and the highest price paid by the general partner or any of its affiliates for any unit within the days preceding the date the purchase is announced 
dependence on terra industries the partnership is dependent on terra industries inc terra in a number of respects 
terra provides all of the partnership s management services and operates all of its facilities through its wholly owned subsidiary tngp  the general partner and tnc  the prior general partner 
terra and its wholly owned subsidiaries have more debt and debt service requirements than the partnership 
although terra is affected by most of the factors that affect the partnership  its higher level of debt could put a greater risk on terra in the event business conditions deteriorate materially 
while the restructuring was undertaken to reinforce the structural independence of the partnership from terra  the partnership s results of operations and financial condition might be materially adversely affected by financial difficulties at terra  default by it or its subsidiaries on their debt or their bankruptcy

forward looking precautions information contained in this report  other than historical information  may be considered forward looking 
forward looking information reflects management s current views of future events and financial performance that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the following changes in the financial markets  general economic conditions within the agricultural industry  competitive factors and price changes principally  nitrogen products selling prices and natural gas costs  changes in product mix  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  changes in weather conditions  changes in agricultural regulations  and other risks detailed in the factors that affect operating results section of this discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the partnership due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the partnership uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the area of changes in natural gas prices 
the partnership has no foreign currency exchange rate risk and all debt carries variable interest rates and approximates fair value 
the general partner s policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
the general partner may not engage in activities that expose the partnership to speculative or non operating risks 
management is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with the overall business objectives of the partnership 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by the general partner s board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to hedge firm commitments and forecasted commodity purchase transactions 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects the partnership to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
the general partner continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
natural gas is the principal raw material used to manufacture nitrogen 
natural gas prices are volatile and the general partner manages some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
the partnership s hedging policy is described under the previous heading  factors that affect operating performance 
the partnership has hedged approximately of anticipated requirements and none of its requirements beyond december  the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on published referenced prices and quoted market prices from brokers 
these instruments fixed natural gas prices at million higher than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse price change 
as of december   the partnership s market risk exposure related to future hedged natural gas requirements was million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since the partnership forward prices only a portion of its natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments should be more than offset by lower costs for natural gas purchases
