item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cost management 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for financial information by geographic area 
sources of supplies although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials  particularly tantalum and palladium  are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers 
tantalum we are a major consumer of the world s annual production of tantalum  a metal used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
there are currently three major suppliers that process tantalum ore into capacitor grade tantalum powder 
we are obligated under contracts with cabot corporation to make purchases of tantalum through these purchase commitments were entered into at a time when market demand for tantalum capacitors was high and tantalum powder was in short supply 
since that time  the price of tantalum has decreased significantly  and accordingly  we wrote down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory on hand and recognized losses on future purchase commitments 
these write downs and purchase commitments are discussed in further detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
palladium palladium  a metal used to produce multi layer ceramic capacitors  is currently found primarily in south africa and russia 
we periodically enter into short term commitments to purchase palladium 
palladium is a commodity product that is subject to price volatility 
we have in the past recorded write downs of palladium inventory on hand and recognized losses on future purchase commitments due to this price volatility 
these write downs and purchase commitments are discussed in further detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
israeli government incentives we have substantial manufacturing operations in israel  where we benefit from the government s employment and tax incentive programs 
these programs have contributed substantially to our growth and profitability 
for the year ended december   sales of products manufactured in israel accounted for approximately of our net sales 
under the terms of the israeli government s incentive programs  once a project is approved  the recipient is eligible to receive the benefits of the related grants for the life of the project  so long as the recipient continues to meet preset eligibility standards 
none of our approved projects has ever been cancelled or modified  and we have already received approval for a majority of the projects contemplated by our capital expenditure program 
however  as a result of the economic downturn beginning in  we were forced to lay off a significant number of employees in israel in in  the israeli government initially withheld certain grant monies claiming that we had not maintained employment at the required minimum levels  however  we were able to settle our dispute in the fourth quarter of and the government agreed to continue making grant payments to us  conditioned upon our agreement to employ a certain number of additional employees by december  while we met the target employment level to satisfy the eligibility requirements for our israeli government grants  economic circumstances could compel future additional layoffs 
also  over the past few years  the israeli government has scaled back or discontinued some of its incentive programs 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain our eligibility for existing projects or that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
because we have received approvals for most projects currently contemplated  we do not anticipate that cutbacks in the incentive programs for new projects would have an adverse impact on our earnings and operations for at least several years 
we might be materially adversely affected if events were to occur in the middle east that interfered with our operations in israel 
however  we have never experienced any material interruption in our israeli operations in our years of operations there  in spite of several middle east crises  including wars 
inventory and backlog we manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications 
we maintain an inventory of standardized components  and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products 
we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months 
many of our customers encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products 
they typically order products from us based on their forecasts 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
customers and marketing we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems  electronic manufacturing services ems companies  which manufacture for oems on an outsourcing basis  and independent distributors that maintain large inventories of electronic components for resale to oems 
during  approximately of our sales were to distributors  approximately of our sales were to oems  and approximately of our sales were to ems companies 
to better serve our customers  we maintain production facilities in regions where we market the bulk of our products 
we work with our customers so that our products are incorporated into the design of electronic equipment at the research and prototype stages 
we also employ a staff of application and field engineers to assist our customers  independent manufacturers representatives and distributors in solving technical problems and developing products to meet specific needs 
our sales organizations are regionally based 
the aim of our sales organizations is to unify the activities of all our divisions and subsidiaries  provide efficiencies by eliminating duplication of functions  and bring greater value to end customers by allowing them to deal with one entity for their semiconductor and passive electronic component purchasing needs 
we market our products in different geographic areas as follows north america sales are made by our north american sales force  sales representative organizations and distributors 
sales representatives are compensated by commissions 
regional sales directors employed by vishay coordinate these representatives and the north american sales force 
our north american sales headquarters are located in shelton  connecticut

regional sales offices are located in singapore  taipei  taiwan  beijing  shanghai  shenzhen and hong kong  china  tokyo and osaka  japan  seoul and gumi  korea  new delhi  pune and bangalore  india  penang  malaysia  and bangkok  thailand 
sales in the rest of the world are made through sales representatives  stocking representatives and distributors 
we have established a strategic global account program  which aligns each of our top customers with an identified strategic global account manager  enabling our diverse product families to have one face to the customer 
each strategic global account manager coordinates sales  marketing  and contract administration for all vishay products  providing one stop access to one of the broadest selections of discrete electronic components available directly from a manufacturing source anywhere in the world 
in addition  vishay has launched an initiative to better meet the needs of our customers for technical and applications support 
as a project started two years ago  vishay s business development group now puts a team of dedicated field application engineers faes in the field for the exclusive support of our customers engineering needs 
organized by market segment  our business development faes bring specific knowledge of component applications in their areas of expertise in the automotive  telecommunications  computer  consumer entertainment  industrial  peripherals  and digital consumer market segments 
with the ultimate goal of a vishay design in the process by which our customers specify a vishay component in their products this exciting new program offers our customers superior access to vishay technologies while at the same time increasing design wins  and ultimately sales  for vishay 
most importantly  the process is closely monitored via a proprietary database developed by the vishay business development group 
our database captures very specific design activity and allows for real time measurement of new business potential for our management team 
our top customers have been quite stable despite not having long term commitments to purchase our products 
with selected customers  we have signed two to three year contracts for specific products 
sales to our top customers comprise approximately of our total sales 
during  approximately of our net sales were attributable to customers in the americas  approximately were attributable to customers in europe  and approximately were attributable to customers in asia 
during  the share of net sales by end use market was as follows industrial   computer   automotive   consumer products   telecommunications   aerospace and military   medical  
competition we face strong competition in various product lines from both domestic and foreign manufacturers that produce products using technologies similar to ours 
our primary competitors by product type include discrete devices fairchild semiconductor  international rectifier  infineon  on semiconductor  philips  rohm  stmicroelectronics  toshiba 
integrated circuits fairchild semiconductor  international rectifier  infineon  maxim  on semiconductor  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments 
optoelectronics avago formerly agilent semiconductor products division  fairchild semiconductor  sharp  toshiba 
resistors and inductors epcos  koa  rohm  yageo 
capacitors avx  epcos  kemet  murata  tdk  yageo 
measurements group various niche competitors 
there are many other companies that produce products in the markets in which we compete 
our competitive position depends on our product quality  know how  proprietary data  marketing and service capabilities and business reputation  as well as on price 
we compete for sales of certain products on the basis of our marketing and distribution network  which provides a high level of customer service 
for example  we work closely with our customers to have our components incorporated into their electronic equipment at the early stages of design and production and maintain redundant production sites for some of our products to ensure an uninterrupted supply of products 
additionally  we believe that our strategic global accounts program  described above  provides us with a competitive advantage 
research and development many of our products and manufacturing techniques  technologies and packaging methods have been invented  designed and developed by our engineers and scientists 
we maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily gauge and satisfy the needs of local markets 
these design centers are located predominantly in the united states  germany  israel  the people s republic of china  france  the republic of china taiwan and south korea 
we also maintain research and development staffs and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products  and to improve manufacturing techniques 
this decentralized system encourages individual product development at individual manufacturing facilities that occasionally has applications at other facilities 
our research and development efforts over the past few years have been largely focused on our semiconductors segment  principally for the development of new power products and power ics 
we also have research and development programs that should enhance our efforts in vertical integration of our product lines  combining vishay components in packages 
examples of these packages include combinations of our sensors and our radio frequency technology to create wireless transducers  wireless precision potentiometers  and other new products 
patents and licenses we have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products 
we seek to protect our technology by  among other things  filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented know how  continuing technological innovation and the aggressive pursuit of licensing opportunities to help develop and maintain our competitive position 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
although we have been awarded  have filed applications for  or have been licensed under  numerous patents in the united states and other countries  there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued 
we require all of our technical  research and development  sales and marketing  and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity s or individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances 
substantially all of our technical  research and development  sales and marketing  and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us 
when we believe other companies are misappropriating our intellectual property rights  we vigorously enforce those rights through legal action  and we intend to continue to do so 
see item  legal proceedings 
although we have numerous united states and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes  no particular patent is considered individually material to our business 
environment  health and safety we have adopted an environmental health and safety corporate policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws  to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment  and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations 
this policy is implemented with accountability directly to the chairman of the board of directors 
in addition  our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment 
vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites 
certain obligations as a prp have arisen in connection with business acquisitions 
the remediation programs are on going at two currently operating us facilities  eight currently operating us facilities  eight formerly owned us sites  and one formerly owned us site 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
see item  legal proceedings 
we are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations 
we continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations 
while we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy 
more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with such regulations 
moreover  the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and  therefore  there can be no assurance that material environmental costs  including remediation costs  will not arise in the future 
with each acquisition  we attempt to identify potential environmental concerns and to minimize  or obtain indemnification for  the environmental matters we may be required to address 
in addition  we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities 
we believe that the reserves we have established are adequate 
nevertheless  we often unavoidably inherit certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  of whom approximately  were located outside the united states 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel 
some of our employees outside the united states are members of trade unions  and employees at one small us facility are represented by a union 
our relationship with our employees is generally good 
however  no assurance can be given that  if we continue to restructure our operations in response to changing economic conditions  labor unrest or strikes will not occur

risk factors from time to time  information provided by us  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on our behalf  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause our results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf factors relating to our business generally our business is cyclical and the periods of decline in demand that we have experienced in the past few years may resume and may become more pronounced 
from to  we and others in the electronic and semiconductor component industry experienced a decline in product demand on a global basis  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals  lower average selling prices  and a material and adverse impact on our results of operations 
this decline was primarily attributable to a slowing of growth in the personal computer and cellular telephone product markets 
we and others in the industry saw indications of improvements in the economy and the electronic and semiconductor component industry in the first half of  followed by a downtrend in the second half of the year and a small improvement in while we are anticipating that there will be an improved business climate in  improvements in the economy and the electronic and semiconductor component industry may not materialize 
the slowdown may resume and may become more pronounced 
a slowdown in demand  as well as recessionary trends in the global economy  make it more difficult for us to predict our future sales and manage our operations  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
we have incurred and may continue to incur restructuring costs and associated asset write downs 
to remain competitive  particularly when business conditions are difficult  we attempt to reduce our cost structure through restructuring activities 
this includes acquisition related restructuring  where we attempt to streamline the operations of companies we acquire and achieve synergies between our acquisitions and our existing businesses 
it also includes restructuring our existing businesses  where we seek to eliminate redundant facilities and staff positions and move operations  where possible  to jurisdictions with lower labor costs 
we recorded restructuring and severance costs  plus related asset write downs  in each of     and  and we expect to incur such expenses during in the past we have grown through acquisitions but this may not continue 
our long term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that acquisitions that we complete in the future will be successful 
if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses  our results of operations  enterprise value  market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected 
our debt levels have increased  which could adversely affect the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition 
our outstanding debt increased from approximately million at the end of to approximately million at the end of  primarily due to our acquisition activity 
while our debt levels decreased in and remained essentially flat in  the marketplace could react negatively to our current debt levels which in turn could affect our share price and also make it more difficult for us to obtain financing in the future 
to remain successful  we must continue to innovate 
our future operating results are dependent on our ability to continually develop  introduce and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 
if this occurs  we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
protection of intellectual property often involves complex legal and factual issues 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our technologies and products  as we deem appropriate 
however  our applications may not result in issued patents 
also  our existing patents and any future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  design around our patented technologies or may challenge or seek to invalidate our patents 
the electronic components industry  particularly the discrete semiconductor sector  is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we have on occasion been notified that we may be infringing patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  customers purchasing components from us have rights to indemnification under certain circumstances if such components violate the intellectual property rights of others 
further  we have observed that in the current electronic components industry business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  and may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations and we have successfully resolved these situations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging intellectual property rights infringement  or that we will be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we have begun to invest in start ups but our investments may not prove successful 
we believe that investment in new technologies that are related to our core businesses is important to position us for the future 
accordingly  we have begun a program of investing in technology start up enterprises  in which we may acquire a controlling or non controlling interest but whose technology would be available to be commercialized by us 
examples are our recent acquisitions of all of the assets of rfwaves  ltd 
and cyoptics israel  ltd 
there are numerous risks in investments of this nature including the limited operating history of such start up entities  their need for capital and their limited or absence of production experience  as well as the risk that their technologies may prove ineffective or fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that our investments in start up enterprises will prove successful 
future acquisitions could require us to issue additional indebtedness or equity 
if we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
under our existing credit facility  we are required to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants including the application of specific financial ratios 
we are also restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock 
we cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required 
if we were to undertake an acquisition for equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
our results are sensitive to raw material availability  quality and cost 
many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price increases for these raw materials 
for example  the prices for tantalum and palladium  two raw materials that we use in our capacitors  are subject to fluctuation 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we recorded substantial write downs of tantalum and palladium in the economic downturn from to  and recorded more modest write downs in from time to time there have been short term market shortages of raw materials 
while these shortages have not historically adversely affected our ability to increase production of products containing tantalum and palladium  they have historically resulted in higher raw material costs for us 
we cannot assure you that any of these market shortages in the future would not adversely affect our ability to increase production  particularly during periods of growing demand for our products 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation 
many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty 
our customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
they often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive  a situation that we have experienced during periods of economic slowdown 
therefore  we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog does not exceed the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog 
we face intense competition in our business  and we market our products to an increasingly concentrated group of customers 
our business is highly competitive worldwide  with low transportation costs and few import barriers 
we compete principally on the bases of product quality and reliability  availability  customer service  technological innovation  timely delivery and price 
the electronics components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors  some of which are larger than us  have significant financial resources and technological capabilities 
our customers have become increasingly concentrated in recent years  and as a result  their buying power has increased and they have had greater ability to negotiate favorable pricing 
this trend has adversely affected our average selling prices  particularly for commodity components 
we may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products 
our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy  we may experience intense demand for our products 
during such periods  we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing to satisfy demand 
factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel  and capacity constraints at our facilities 
if we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production  we could lose customers and or market share 
these losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase costs 
our manufacturing operations  products and or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes  employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes  products or packaging  restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging  and responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging 
we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate 
nevertheless  we often unavoidably inherit certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future acquisition we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot presently determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with these regulations 
in order to resolve liabilities at various sites  we have entered into various administrative orders and consent decrees  some of which may be  under certain conditions  reopened or subject to renegotiation 
our products may experience a reduction in product classification levels under various military specifications 
we have qualified certain of our products under various military specifications  approved and monitored by the united states defense electronic supply center  and under certain european military specifications 
these products are assigned certain classification levels 
in order to maintain the classification level of a product  we must continuously perform tests on the product and the results of these tests must be reported to governmental agencies 
if any of our products fails to meet the requirements of the applicable classification level  that product s classification may be reduced to a lower level 
a decrease in the classification level for any of our products with a military application could have an adverse impact on the net sales and earnings attributable to that product 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  marketing  finance and administrative personnel 
rapid changes in technologies  frequent new product introductions  and declining average selling prices over product life cycles require us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis 
our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal  tax  accounting  financial reporting  auditing  and treasury 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
while we have employment agreements with five of our executives  we have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of or the failure to effectively recruit qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
factors relating to vishay s operations outside the united states we obtain substantial benefits by operating in israel  but these benefits may not continue 
we have increased our operations in israel over the past several years 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country  compared to the rates in the united states  have had the general effect of increasing our net earnings  although this was not the case during   and due to losses on purchase commitments 
also  we have benefited from employment incentive grants made by the israeli government 
in  the israeli government suspended payment on one of these grants after we were forced to lay off a significant number of employees as a result of the economic downturn 
although we reached agreement with the israeli government to resume payment on this grant  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our eligibility for this or other existing project grants 
there can also be no assurance that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new grant and tax incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of the israeli grant programs that have benefited us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low  but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense 
our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs  such as the czech republic  india  israel  malaysia  mexico  the people s republic of china  and the philippines 
during this process  we may experience under utilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions 
this under utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
these costs include those associated with compensation in connection with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower labor cost regions 
in addition  as we implement transfers of certain of our operations we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay offs or termination of our employees in high labor cost countries 
we are subject to the risks of political  economic and military instability in countries outside the united states in which we operate 
we have operations outside the united states  and approximately of our revenues during were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political  economic and military instability or unrest 
these conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and  depending on the extent and severity of these conditions  could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results 
we have never experienced any material interruption in our israeli operations in our years of operations there  in spite of several middle east crises  including wars 
however  we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the middle east that interfered with our operations in israel 
our business may be adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of diseases 
the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  that began in the people s republic of china adversely affected our business during the first six months of  particularly in asia where we derive approximately to of our revenue 
this impact included disruptions in the operations of our customers  a slowdown in customer orders and reduced sales in certain end markets 
if an outbreak of sars or another disease were to recur on a comparable scale in asia or elsewhere  we could experience similar disruptions to our business 
general economic and business factors in addition to the factors relating specifically to our business  a variety of other factors relating to general conditions could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
these factors include overall economic and business conditions  competitive factors in the industries in which we conduct our business  changes in governmental regulation  changes in tax requirements  including tax rate changes  new tax laws  and revised tax law interpretations  changes in generally accepted accounting principles or interpretations of those principles by governmental agencies and self regulatory groups  interest rate fluctuations  foreign currency rate fluctuations  and other capital market conditions  and economic and political conditions in international markets  including governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders 
our common stock  traded on the new york stock exchange  has in the past experienced  and may continue to experience  significant fluctuations in price and volume 
we believe that the financial performance and activities of other publicly traded companies in the electronic component and semiconductor industries could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially without regard to our operating performance 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new factors emerge from time to time

intellectual property matters we are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing issues 
in addition  we have observed that in the current electronic component and semiconductor industry business environment  companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors 
while we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may become party to disputes regarding patent licensing and cross patent licensing 
an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

we are receiving royalties on sales of these companies products which use our technology 
we presently have other pending legal actions that we have initiated against companies which we believe are misappropriating our intellectual property rights 
siliconix shareholder matters proctor litigation in january  an amended class action complaint was filed in the superior court of california on behalf of all non vishay stockholders of siliconix against vishay  ernst young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the company s financial statements  dr 
felix zandman  chairman and chief technical and business development officer of vishay  and  as a nominal defendant  siliconix 
the suit purports to state various derivative and class claims against the defendants including the purported taking by vishay of siliconix sales subsidiaries and the profits of those subsidiaries  the purported taking by vishay of siliconix s sap software system without compensation to siliconix  the alleged use by vishay of siliconix s assets as security for vishay loans without compensation to siliconix  the purported misappropriation by vishay of siliconix s identity  the alleged taking by vishay of siliconix testing equipment  the alleged use by vishay of siliconix to save vishay certain credits made available by an israeli business development agency  the alleged misuse by vishay of siliconix s patents to help vishay acquire general semiconductor  and the allegedly improper identification of dr 
zandman as a co inventor on certain siliconix patents 
the action seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
on april   vishay i demurred to the class action claim in the amended complaint  on the ground that plaintiffs lack standing to bring a direct claim  ii moved to strike some of the allegations in the derivative cause of action as barred by the applicable statutes of limitation  and iii moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs failed to prosecute their claims in a timely manner 
also on april   defendant ernst young moved to dismiss the claims against it and  in the alternative  for a stay of the litigation so that the causes of action asserted against ernst young may first be arbitrated 
on june   vishay and ernst young separately demurred to the derivative claim on the ground that as a consequence of the merger of siliconix with a subsidiary of vishay  plaintiffs no longer had standing to pursue a derivative claim 
at a hearing on august   the court sustained the parties demurrers to the direct and the derivative claims and granted plaintiffs leave to replead both claims 
an amended complaint was filed in november both vishay and ernst young have demurred to the complaint  primarily on the ground that plaintiffs lack standing because of the nature of their claims and because they are no longer siliconix shareholders 
tender offer litigation as further described in note to our consolidated condensed financial statements  on may   vishay successfully completed a tender offer for shares of siliconix not owned by vishay 
following the announcement of vishay s intention to make the tender offer for the remaining shares of siliconix that vishay did not already own  several purported class action complaints were filed in the delaware chancery court against vishay  siliconix  and the siliconix directors  alleging  among other things  that the intended offer was unfair and a breach of fiduciary duty  and seeking  among other things  to enjoin the transaction 
these actions were consolidated into a single class action  and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on april  further alleging that defendants failed to disclose or misrepresented material information relating to the tender offer 
on april   the parties to the delaware consolidated action executed a memorandum of understanding providing for the settlement of all claims relating to the tender offer 
the settlement agreement reached with the plaintiffs was approved by the court on october  a single stockholder class action also was filed in california state court challenging the tender offer 
on april   the california superior court granted vishay s motion to stay the purported class action filed in california challenging the offer 
a court status conference is scheduled for april  to address whether the named plaintiff intends to ask the court to lift the stay 
vishay will seek formal dismissal of this action  as  in its opinion  the court approval of the settlement of the delaware consolidated action makes the california action moot 
stockholders seeking appraisal rights on may   vishay effected a merger of a subsidiary of vishay with and into siliconix  as a result of which siliconix became a wholly owned subsidiary of vishay 
in the merger  each share of siliconix stock  other than those owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  was converted into the right to receive shares of vishay common stock  subject to the right of siliconix s remaining stockholders to seek appraisal under delaware law 
the exercise period for filing a petition asserting appraisal rights under delaware law expired on september  although several holders notified the company of their desire to exercise their appraisal rights  these holders either subsequently withdrew or otherwise did not validly assert those rights before the expiration date 
environmental matters vishay is involved in environmental remediation programs at various sites currently or formerly owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  in addition to involvement as a potentially responsible party prp at three superfund sites 
certain obligations as a prp have arisen in connection with business acquisitions 
the remediation programs are on going at two currently operating us facilities  eight currently operating us facilities  eight formerly owned us sites  and one formerly owned us site 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations  and alternative cleanup methods 
based upon our experience with the foregoing environmental matters  we have concluded that there is at least a reasonable possibility that we will incur remedial costs in the range of million to million 
as of december   we concluded that the best estimate within this range is million  of which million is included in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  and million is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the million accrual  approximately million is due to liabilities assumed in the acquisition of general semiconductor  approximately million is due to liabilities assumed in the acquisition of bccomponents  and approximately million is reserved for other miscellaneous environmental liabilities  the most significant of which is related to our vitramon subsidiary in the united states 
in view of our financial position and provisions for environmental matters of million  we have concluded that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity

management believes that stating the impact on net earnings of items such as restructuring and severance  asset write downs  inventory write downs  gains or losses on purchase commitments  losses on early extinguishment of debt  gains on insurance proceeds  charges for in process research and development  special tax items  and other items is meaningful to investors because it provides insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vishay intertechnology  inc is an international manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components  including power mosfets  power conversion and motor control integrated circuits  transistors  diodes  optoelectronic components  resistors  capacitors  inductors  strain gages  load cells  force measurement sensors  displacement sensors  and photoelastic sensors 
semiconductors and electronic components manufactured by vishay are used in virtually all types of electronic products  including those in the computer  telecommunications  military aerospace  instrument  automotive  medical  and consumer electronics industries 
vishay operates in two segments  semiconductors formerly referred to as our active components segment and passive components 
semiconductors segment products include transistors  diodes  rectifiers  certain types of integrated circuits and optoelectronic products 
our semiconductors segment includes our siliconix subsidiary  of which we completed the acquisition of the interest that we did not already own during the second quarter of passive components segment products include resistors  capacitors  and inductors 
we include in this segment our measurements group  which manufactures and markets strain gages  load cells  transducers  instruments and weighing systems whose core components are resistors that are sensitive to various types of mechanical stress 
the passive components business had historically predominated at vishay until the purchase of general semiconductor in november  after which the lead position shifted to the semiconductors business 
with the acquisition of bccomponents in december  revenues from our semiconductors and passive components businesses are essentially split evenly 
consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  compared to net revenues of billion for the year ended december  net earnings for the year ended december  were million or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  earnings for the year ended december  were impacted by restructuring and severance costs of million  asset write downs of million  write offs of purchased in process research and development of million  and siliconix transaction related expenses of million 
these items were partially offset by a gain on adjustment of existing purchase commitments of million and a gain on sale of land of million 
in addition  tax expense includes a million benefit  primarily due to favorable foreign tax rulings 
these items and their tax related consequences had a negative effect on earnings per share 
earnings for the year ended december  were impacted by restructuring and severance costs of million  asset write downs of million  losses on purchase commitments of million  write downs of inventory of million  and a write off of purchased in process research and development of million 
these items were partially offset by a favorable settlement of an outstanding note receivable of million 
these items and their related tax effects  net of a favorable tax settlement  reduced earnings by per share 
the business environment for electronic components was relatively friendly during while product sales were lower than levels  our cost reduction efforts are yielding margin improvements that are expected to continue into revenues in improved compared to depressed levels in the third and fourth quarters of financial metrics we utilize several financial measures and metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include sales  gross profit margin  end of period backlog  and the book to bill ratio 
we also monitor changes in inventory turnover and average selling prices asp 
gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of sales 
gross profit is generally net sales less cost of products sold  but also deducts certain other period costs  particularly losses on purchase commitments and inventory write downs 
losses on purchase commitments and inventory write downs have the impact of reducing gross profit margin in the period of the charge  but result in improved gross profit margins in subsequent periods by reducing costs of products sold as inventory is used 
gross profit margin is clearly a function of net sales  but also reflects our cost cutting programs and our ability to contain fixed costs 
end of period backlog is one indicator of future sales 
we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period as compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that our backlog is building and that we are likely to see increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of declining demand and may foretell declining sales 
we focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our cost of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory computed using each quarter end balance for this same period 
the inventory balance used for computation of this ratio includes tantalum inventories in excess of one year supply  which are classified as other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital 
pricing in our industry can be volatile 
we analyze trends and changes in average selling prices to evaluate likely future pricing 
the erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the industry 
however  we attempt to offset this deterioration with ongoing cost reduction activities and new product introductions  as newer products typically yield larger gross margins 
the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows net revenues  gross profit margin  the end of period backlog  the book to bill ratio  the inventory turnover  and changes in asp for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter net revenues gross profit margin end of period backlog book to bill ratio inventory turnover change in asp vs 
prior quarter net revenues include royalty revenues of million  million  million  million  and million for the fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  and fourth quarter  respectively 
gross profit margin includes the impact of inventory write downs  and gain loss on purchase commitments 
see segments below for net revenues  book to bill ratio  and gross profit margin broken out by segment 
while economic conditions were not as favorable as the business environment experienced during the first half of  the relatively friendly worldwide business climate for the electronics industry continued into the fourth quarter of orders steadily improved over the course of the third and fourth quarters  partially impacted by seasonal effects 
for the fourth quarter of  the overall book to bill ratio remained healthy at  following the third quarter of where the book to bill ratio was 
orders from distributors were particularly strong in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a book to bill ratio for these customers of  compared to a ratio of during the third quarter of orders from original equipment manufacturers nearly matched orders shipped in the fourth quarter of  resulting in a book to bill ratio for these customers of  compared to a ratio of during the third quarter of we continue to experience pressure on selling prices  although the price decline slowed compared to historical rates of decline 
as expected  pricing pressures were most significant on commodity products 
vishay continues to concentrate on less price sensitive products and markets  where pricing pressures seem to have eased in general with demand increasing 
we believe pricing will be moderately lower in as a result of our various programs to cut costs as well as to expand capacity where needed  we were able to improve our gross profit margin in each quarter of and expect to continue this improvement into due to higher volume and continued cost reduction 
capacity utilization capacity utilization is a reflection of product demand and of available capacities 
capacity load generally improved during the second half of in the passive components segment 
our resistor lines were operating at an average of to of capacity  which represented an improvement over the to capacity utilization experienced during during the second half of  our capacitor lines operated at approximately to of capacity  an improvement over the to averages achieved during the first half of and the second half of  and in line with the utilization rate during the first half of we continue to operate near full capacity in most of our front end semiconductors facilities 
we have taken and will continue to take necessary steps to increase our capacity to accommodate increased demand 
these steps have included removing production bottlenecks in our fabrication facilities and securing additional equipment to expand our backend operations 
we have made significant investments in expanding capacity in our semiconductors facilities 
some of this additional capacity has come on line  and it will ramp up in future quarters 
we have been implementing a project to add inch silicon wafer manufacturing capabilities at the fabrication facility in itzehoe  germany 
this project is expected to alleviate capacity constraints for high cell density wafers and reduce costs 
we have received the benefit of grants from the government of the german state of schleswig holstein related to these additional investments at the itzehoe facility 
excluding grant monies  this significant increase in capital expenditures required to support our expansion program is expected to be funded almost entirely by cash flows from operations 
our siliconix division also maintains long term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front end capacity 
siliconix entered into a long term foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with tower semiconductor in may  pursuant to which siliconix will purchase semiconductor wafers valued at approximately million from tower semiconductor over a seven to ten year period 
siliconix began to place orders pursuant to this agreement in after the completion of a technology transfer qualification period 
the agreement specifies minimum quantities per month and a fixed quantity for the term of the agreement 
we must pay for any short fall in minimum order quantities specified under the agreement 
during the third quarter of  tower began to ship wafers pursuant to this agreement 
the agreement provides for a gradual increase in quantities over the initial three years of the agreement 
the present shipments are on schedule with the ramp up contemplated in the agreement 
also in  siliconix entered into a five year foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with a subcontractor in japan 
this agreement was a continuation and expansion of a previous technology transfer and business agreement for the manufacture of silicon wafers 
the agreement calls for siliconix to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of estimated requirements 
the first six months of this forecast are fixed as to quantity  and the subsequent six months are guaranteed not to be less than a quantity stated in the agreement 
thereafter  the monthly quantity may vary based on market demand 
under the agreement  siliconix must guarantee that its business with this subcontractor represents a minimum percentage of wafer requirements and is required to use its best efforts not to reduce the average monthly demand rate below a specified threshold 
acquisition activity as part of our growth strategy  we seek to expand through acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components that have established positions in major markets  reputations for product quality and reliability  and product lines with which we have substantial marketing and technical expertise 
also as part of this growth strategy  we seek to explore opportunities with privately held developers of electronic components  whether through acquisition  investment in non controlling interests  or strategic alliances 
during  we completed three strategic acquisitions and also acquired the interest in siliconix that we did not already own 
we also divested a non core business acquired in one of these transactions 
during  we completed two strategic acquisitions 
we are presently evaluating some smaller acquisition targets to enhance new product development  round out our product lines  or grow our high margin niche market businesses 
we are also continuing our exploration of opportunities to acquire a larger target in order to gain market share and more effectively penetrate many geographic markets 
activities on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of si technologies  inc  a designer  manufacturer  and marketer of high performance industrial sensors and controls  weighing and automotive systems  and related products 
the purchase price was million in cash  plus the assumption of million of si technologies debt  of which we caused million to be repaid subsequent to closing 
the remaining outstanding amounts on the short term revolving credit facility of si technologies european subsidiary were repaid during the third quarter of on october   we sold aerogo  inc  si technologies subsidiary engaged in the design  manufacture  and marketing of industrial automation products  for approximately million 
the purchase price was paid in cash of million and two promissory notes 
the first promissory note  for million  was paid in full in december the second promissory note is due in quarterly installments through the buyer prepaid approximately million of the second promissory note in december  and made an additional prepayment of approximately million in january no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of aerogo 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed two niche acquisitions 
on october   we acquired the assets of cyoptics israel  ltd  which will initially be utilized primarily as a research and development facility 
on november   we acquired alpha electronics kk  a japanese manufacturer of foil resistors 
the purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately million  plus assumption of approximately million of debt 
minority interest in siliconix on may   we completed an offer to exchange shares of vishay common stock for shares of siliconix stock that we did not already own 
each siliconix share tendered was exchanged for shares of vishay common stock  with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of vishay 
prior to the exchange offer  vishay owned approximately of the common stock of siliconix 
following the completion of the exchange offer  vishay s ownership increased to approximately of the common stock of siliconix  which was above the threshold necessary to effect a merger without a vote of stockholders 
on may   vishay effected a merger of a subsidiary of vishay with and into siliconix  as a result of which siliconix became a wholly owned subsidiary of vishay 
in the merger  each share of siliconix stock  other than those owned by vishay and its subsidiaries  was converted into shares of vishay common stock  subject to the right of siliconix s remaining stockholders to seek appraisal under delaware law 
cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares of vishay 
as a controlled majority owned subsidiary  the results of operations of siliconix were included in our consolidated financial statements prior to the acquisition of the minority interest  and the outside stockholders interests were shown as minority interest on the consolidated statements of operations and the consolidated balance sheets 
the acquisition of the minority interest in siliconix contributed approximately million incrementally to our earnings for following the announcement of our intention to make the tender offer for the remaining shares of siliconix that we did not already own  several purported class action complaints were filed against vishay  siliconix  and the siliconix directors  alleging  among other things  that the intended offer was unfair and a breach of fiduciary duty  and seeking  among other things  to enjoin the transaction 
additional information related to these actions is included in item  legal proceedings 
both vishay and siliconix incurred expenses associated with the defense of the stockholder litigation described above and the subsequent settlement 
additionally  siliconix incurred expenses related to the exchange offer  including costs of the special committee of independent siliconix directors appointed to evaluate the offer and the costs of the special committee s financial and legal advisors 
these costs do not represent vishay s direct costs of the acquisition  and accordingly are not included in the purchase price 
these costs  aggregating million  are included in a separate line item in the consolidated statement of operations 
purchased in process research and development represents the value assigned in a business combination to research and development projects of the acquired business that were commenced  but not completed  at the date of acquisition  for which technological feasibility has not been established  and which have no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
amounts assigned to purchased in process research and development meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the business combination 
a charge of million was recorded in the second quarter of  equal to approximately of the value of siliconix in process research and development at the time of the acquisition of the minority interest 
a charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to purchased in process research and development associated with the alpha electronics kk transaction 
activities on august   we acquired substantially all of the assets of rfwaves  ltd  a fab less integrated circuit design house located in israel 
on september   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of aeroflex pearl river inc renamed vishay mic technology  inc  the former thin film interconnect subsidiary of aeroflex  incorporated 
the total purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately million  which included cash payments of million plus stock options with an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
the purchase agreement for rfwaves includes provisions for vishay to pay additional consideration subject to rfwaves achieving operational targets through the payment of this additional consideration would not be material to vishay s financial position or cash flows 
a charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of in conjunction with purchased in process research and development related to the rfwaves acquisition

cost management we place a strong emphasis on reducing our costs 
one way we do this is by moving production to the extent possible from high labor cost markets  such as the united states and western europe  to lower labor cost markets  such as the czech republic  israel  india  malaysia  mexico  the people s republic of china and the philippines 
the percentage of our total headcount in lower labor cost countries is a measure of the extent to which we are successful in implementing this program 
this percentage was at the end of  as compared to at the end of  at the end of  at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of our long term target is to have between and of our headcount in lower labor cost countries 
since  we have been implementing aggressive cost reduction programs to enhance our competitiveness  particularly in light of the erosion of average selling prices of established products that is typical of the industry 
we are placing particular emphasis on cost reduction in our capacitor lines  which were hardest hit by the market downturn experienced from to and where the business continues to suffer from worldwide overcapacity 
during  we closed our sanford  maine tantalum capacitor manufacturing facility 
we continue to consolidate our existing film capacitor lines within the business of bccomponents  including transferring production to india and the people s republic of china after closing facilities in germany and the czech republic and reducing production in portugal and belgium 
we also finalized the first phase of a production transfer of tantalum molded finishing operations from israel to the people s republic of china 
we will begin the implementation of the second phase of this transfer during the first half of during  we closed our norfolk  nebraska resistors manufacturing facility 
during the second quarter of  we shipped our first thin film chips from israel  a key milestone in the planned production transfer of this product line from germany 
during the third quarter of  we announced the transfer of non linear resistors finishing operations from evere  belgium to danshui  china  and announced that we plan to close our swindon  uk variable resistors facility and transfer production to the czech republic 
during  we completed the closure of our colmar  france small signal diode facility and transferred the production to the people s republic of china and hungary 
we also continued the transfer of our power diode production from the republic of china taiwan to the people s republic of china  which was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of  with a few product qualifications still pending 
our restructuring plans also included the integration of acquired businesses 
the integration of the operations of vishay mic technology  acquired in september  into our existing electro films facility was finalized ahead of plan during the second quarter of the pearl river  new york facility acquired in the mic technology acquisition is presently being marketed for sale 
we continue to integrate si technologies  acquired in april  into our existing businesses  including consolidating the tustin  california facility and our existing transducer and strain gage facility in covina  california 
we expect substantial synergies from the integration of the si technologies business  which we expect to further enhance the profitability of our measurements group 
during  we achieved approximately million of savings as a result of our restructuring and other cost savings efforts 
in april  we began evaluating additional restructuring initiatives to improve the results of underperforming divisions  which we expect will eventually generate additional annual cost savings of million  of which we believe approximately million will begin to be realized in our cost savings initiatives are expected to include a combination of production transfers  plant closures  and overhead streamlining 
our restructuring plans for include moving certain back end siliconix division production from the republic of china taiwan to the people s republic of china  consolidating some locations in hungary and germany  shifting production for a portion of our film capacitor product lines from belgium to india and china  shifting production for a portion of our aluminum capacitor product lines from the netherlands to austria and or sub contractors  and completing a second phase of transferring our tantalum molded capacitor finishing operation from israel to the people s republic of china 
while streamlining and reducing fixed overhead  we are exercising caution so that we will not negatively impact our customer service or our ability to further develop products and processes 
our cost management plans also include expansion of certain critical capacities  which we hope will reduce average materials and processing costs 
israeli government incentives our production facilities in israel benefit from incentives offered by the israeli government for the creation of jobs and capital investment in that country 
these benefits take the form of government grants and reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
these reduced tax rates apply to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten or fifteen years 
the lower tax rates in israel applicable to us ordinarily have resulted in increased earnings compared to what earnings would have been had statutory united states tax rates applied 
during  we resolved certain tax matters with the israeli government  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
including this benefit  the net impact of the tax rates in israel was an increase in earnings of approximately million during however  due to write downs of inventories and the losses on purchase commitments recorded in   and  the application of the israeli tax rates rather than united states tax rates resulted in decreases in net income of million in and million in as compared to what earnings would have been had statutory united states tax rates applied 
israeli government grants are awarded to specific projects 
these grants are intended to promote employment in israel s industrial sector and are conditioned on the recipient maintaining certain prescribed employment levels 
grants are paid when the related projects are approved by the israeli government and become operational 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction in the costs of products sold  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet reflected million in deferred grant income 
during the second quarter of  the government of israel informed us that because the headcount in our israeli subsidiaries decreased significantly over the previous months  the government intended to withhold up to million in grant monies otherwise due to us 
the grant  which was made by the israeli government under an economic stimulus program  was conditioned in part on minimum employment levels at certain of our israeli facilities 
the israeli government argued that we had not maintained employment at the required minimum levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we settled our dispute with the government of israel  and the government agreed to continue making grant payments to us 
under the terms of the settlement with the israeli government  we were required to employ at least an additional  employees in israel by december  in order to preserve our eligibility for the government grant and tax benefits 
while we met the target employment level to satisfy the eligibility requirements for our israeli government grants  economic circumstances could compel future additional layoffs 
if we were no longer able to maintain the required level of employment in the future  we could be required to return some grant funds and repay certain tax benefits that were previously awarded to us 
the effect of the return of these funds would be to reduce our income in future years 
write downs of inventory and purchase commitments tantalum tantalum is the principal material used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
we generally purchase this metal in powder or wire form  although in and early  when we perceived possible supply shortages  we also stockpiled quantities of tantalum ore 
in july and november of  we entered into purchase contracts with cabot corporation for tantalum powder and wire that committed us to minimum purchases of these materials at fixed prices through in through  as a result of the general downturn in the electronics business  we experienced a significant decrease in capacitor sales 
prices of tantalum ore  powder and wire and of palladium also experienced significant declines 
as a result of these declines in prices  we recorded in costs of products sold write downs of tantalum inventories to then current market value of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
also as a result of this decline in prices  we recorded losses on purchase commitments for tantalum of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
losses on purchase commitments and the related liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet is estimated based on our contractually obligated purchase prices  expected market prices  and the contractually obligated mix of tantalum grades to be purchased 
the mix of tantalum grades to be purchased is within a range specified by the contracts 
the pricing trend for tantalum has been relatively stable since the mix of our purchases of tantalum grades during and was significantly different than initially assumed  which resulted in adjustments to our purchase commitment liability additional losses in and of approximately million and million  respectively 
furthermore  one of our contracts for tantalum purchases provides for price reductions in if certain conditions are met 
we have confirmed with cabot that we have met all of these conditions  and accordingly  our estimates of our liability for these purchase commitments as of december  are based on the assumption that we will receive these conditional price reductions in as a result of meeting the criteria to receive these lower contract prices for  we recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately million  resulting in a net gain of approximately million for the year ended december  if the downward market pricing trend were to resume  we could again be required to write down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory and record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
changes in our mix of tantalum grade purchases could also require us to record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
during the past five years  our minimum purchase commitments under the contracts with cabot have exceeded our production requirements for tantalum capacitors 
this is expected to be the case in  the final year of the contract 
tantalum powder and wire have an indefinite shelf life  therefore  we believe that we will eventually utilize all of the material in our inventory or purchased under the contracts 
based on usage currently expected in  our inventory on hand plus our future purchase commitments represent approximately years of usage 
we have little visibility of the demand for our tantalum capacitor products beyond twelve months 
it is almost certain that our actual requirements of tantalum will differ from those projected  and likely that the difference will be material 
also see contractual commitments below 
palladium palladium is a precious metal used in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors that we purchase under short term contracts 
we recorded in costs of products sold write downs of palladium inventories to then current market value of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and a loss on purchase commitments of million during the year ended december  foreign currency in  we realized approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
any third party sales not using the us dollar as the functional currency must be reported in the local currency and be translated at the weighted average exchange rate 
this translation has an impact on the net sales line of the consolidated statements of operations and also on the expense lines of the consolidated statements of operations 
we generally do not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  although we do maintain cash balances in foreign currencies to act as a natural hedge of certain net exposures 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
we historically have had agreements with distributors that provided limited rights of product return 
beginning in  we modified these arrangements to allow distributors a limited credit for unsaleable products  which we term a scrap allowance 
consistent with industry practice  we also have a stock  ship and debit program whereby we consider  and grant at our discretion  requests by distributors for credits on previously purchased products that remain in distributors inventory  to enable the distributors to offer more competitive pricing 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements whereby we provide distributors with protection against price reductions that we initiate after sale of product to the distributor and prior to resale by the distributor 
we record end of period accruals for each of the programs based upon our estimate of future credits under the programs that will be attributable to sales recorded through the end of the period 
we calculate reductions of revenue attributable to each of the programs during any period by computing the change in the accruals from the prior period and adding the credits actually given to distributors during the period under the programs 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments  but we believe they enable us to estimate reasonably future credits under the programs 
recording and monitoring of these accruals takes place at our subsidiaries and divisions  with input from sales and marketing personnel and review  assessment and  if necessary  adjustment by corporate management 
while our subsidiaries and divisions utilize different methodologies based on their individual experiences  all of the methodologies take into account certain elements that management considers relevant  such as sales to distributors during the relevant period  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies  and open requests for credits 
in our judgment  the different methodologies provide us with equally reliable estimates upon which to base our accruals 
we do not track the credits that we record against specific products sold from distributor inventories  so as to directly compare revenue reduction for credits recorded during any period with credits ultimately awarded in respect of products sold during that period 
nevertheless  we believe that we have an adequate basis to assess the reasonableness and reliability of our estimates 
we recognize royalty revenue in accordance with agreed upon terms when performance obligations are satisfied  the amount is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn royalties at the point of sale of products which incorporate licensed intellectual property 
accordingly  the amount of royalties recognized is determined based on our licensees periodic reporting to us and judgments and estimates by vishay management that we believe are reasonable 
however  it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectibility of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for instance  in the case of tantalum  we estimate market value by obtaining current quotations from available sources of supply 
for work in process goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
over the past few years  we have recorded write downs of our tantalum and palladium inventories to then current market value 
inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
estimates of restructuring and severance costs and purchase related restructuring costs in   and  we recorded restructuring and severance costs of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to our existing businesses 
our restructuring activities related to existing business were designed to reduce both our fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for our products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn experienced from to these included the disposition of fixed assets and the termination of employees 
acquisition related restructuring costs are included in the allocation of the cost of the acquired business and generally add to goodwill 
other restructuring costs are expensed during the period in which we determine that we will incur those costs  and all of the requirements for accrual are met 
because these costs are recorded based upon estimates  our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this happens  we will have to adjust our estimates in future periods 
in the case of acquisition related restructuring costs  if our initial estimate is too high  this would generally require a change in value of the goodwill appearing on our balance sheet  but would not affect our earnings 
assuming our allocation of purchase price of the respective acquisition is finalized  if our initial estimate of purchase related restructuring costs is too low  we would be required to record additional expenses in future periods 
in the case of other restructuring costs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or to reverse part of the charges that we recorded initially  if our initial estimates were too high 
raw material write downs in recent years  we took charges against contractual commitments to purchase tantalum powder and wire through and wrote down our existing inventory of tantalum ore  powder and wire to then present market value 
we did this because the current market prices of tantalum are substantially below the prices at which we are committed to purchase tantalum in the future under long term contracts and the prices at which we were carrying our tantalum raw materials inventory 
these actions involved significant judgments on our part  including decisions of whether to take these charges and write downs  their timing and their amount 
we made the decision to take the charges and write downs after our management concluded that the substantial fall off in the demand for tantalum capacitors was likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
combining this assessment with the worldwide over capacity in tantalum production  we could not foresee when tantalum prices might recover from their currently depressed levels 
although we believe that both the charges and write downs as well as their timing were appropriate under the circumstances  our visibility for future demand and pricing is limited and the judgments made by our management necessarily involved subjective assessments 
losses on purchase commitments and the related liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet is estimated based on our contractually obligated purchase prices  expected market prices  and the contractually obligated mix of tantalum grades to be purchased 
the mix of tantalum grades to be purchased is within a range specified by the contracts 
there is no established market on which tantalum raw materials are regularly traded and quoted 
we based our determination of current market price on quotations from two suppliers of these materials 
we cannot say that the prices at which we could currently enter into contracts for the purchase of tantalum would be the same as these quoted prices 
had we made other assumptions on current and future prices for tantalum  the amount of the inventory write downs and the losses on our purchase commitments would have been different 
the pricing trend for tantalum has been relatively stable since the mix of our purchases of tantalum grades during and was significantly different than initially assumed  which resulted in adjustments to our purchase commitment liability being recorded 
furthermore  one of our contracts with cabot for tantalum purchases provides for price reductions in if certain conditions are met 
we have confirmed with cabot that we have met all of these conditions  and accordingly  our estimates of our liability recorded for these purchase commitments as of december  are based on the assumption that we will receive these conditional price reductions in if the downward market pricing trend were to resume  we could again be required to write down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory and record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
changes in our mix of tantalum grade purchases could also require us to record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
if tantalum prices were to recover in the future  we would not reverse the write downs that we have taken on our raw materials inventory  so that our cost of materials will continue to reflect these write downs regardless of future price increases in tantalum 
this could have the effect of increasing the earnings that we realize in future periods 
based upon similar considerations  we recorded write downs of our palladium inventory to market value in and we also recorded a loss on purchase commitments for palladium in goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
these tests will be performed more frequently if there are triggering events 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a comparable companies market multiple approach 
the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are the members of our peer group included in the presentation of our stock performance in our annual proxy statement 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test  which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
we noted no impairment in our annual assessment of goodwill during the years ended december    or impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets  other than goodwill and tradenames  including property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded asset write downs of million  million  and million  respectively 
asset write downs included amounts to reduce the carrying value of certain buildings which had been vacated as part of our restructuring activities  based on expected future selling prices 
asset write downs in and also included charges to write down certain equipment to salvage value after we determined that it would not be used at other vishay locations subsequent to the completion of our restructuring plans 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain positions will be challenged and that our positions may not be fully sustained 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law  and emerging legislation 
these accruals are based on management s best estimate of potential tax exposures 
when particular matters arise  a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
during and  several matters were favorably resolved as a result of the completion of examinations and the retroactive approval of our application for tax incentives in certain jurisdictions 
we have recorded deferred tax assets representing future tax benefits  but may not be able to realize these future tax benefits in certain jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the expected future realizability of these deferred tax assets 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets

growth in the laptop and pc market  driven by technical progress  resulted in improvements in the second quarter of  ahead of a substantial seasonal upturn noticed in the third quarter of in the telecommunications sector  the worldwide move to g mobile phones increased sales of our products for end uses in the sector during  principally in the first and third quarters 
during  sales of products for use in consumer products were relatively strong in the us  and improved in asia  although they remained weak in europe 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or over the prior year

we make deductions corresponding to particular sales in the period in which the sales are made  although the corresponding credits may not be issued until future periods 
we estimate the deductions based on sales levels to distributors  inventory levels at the distributors  current and projected market trends and conditions  recent and historical activity under the relevant programs  changes in program policies and open requests for credits 
we recorded deductions from gross sales under our distributor incentive programs of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  as a percentage of gross sales   and  respectively 
actual credits issued under the programs for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
increases and decreases in these incentives are largely attributable to the then current business climate 
the general decrease in the incentives since is indicative of the generally improving business climate affecting our distributors and the electronic component industry 
the decrease is also attributable to changes in our pricing structure during to more closely match the distributors pricing structure to their end use customers 
gross profit and margins costs of products sold as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  was  the same as the prior year

the impact of these cost savings plans has been partially offset by the underutilization of capacity in commodity products 
net revenues of the passive components segment for the year ended december  were  million  as compared to  million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in net revenues was attributable to volume increases in all passive components product lines and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by price declines 
volumes increased approximately in  which was offset by a decline in average selling prices versus the weakening of the us dollar against foreign currencies for the year ended december  resulted in increases in reported revenues of million as compared to gross profit as a percentage of net revenues in were as compared to for margins were affected negatively by raw material related write downs in both and during  we recorded write downs of million to reduce palladium inventories to market value 
we also recorded losses on tantalum purchase commitments of million and on palladium purchase commitments of million during during  we recorded write downs of million to reduce tantalum and palladium inventories to then current market value  and losses on purchase commitments for future delivery of tantalum of million 
the improvement in gross margins in is primarily due to lower inventory related charges  higher volume  lower obsolescence costs  and our cost reduction programs  partially offset by lower prices

sg a expenses for the year ended december  were of net revenues as compared to of net revenues for the year ended december  the reduction in this percentage is largely due to increased sales  but also reflected progress in our cost reduction initiatives  including streamlining the operations of bccomponents  which we acquired in december this improvement  as a percentage of revenues  was achieved despite increased costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
restructuring and severance costs and related asset write downs our restructuring activities have been designed to reduce both fixed and variable costs  particularly in response to the reduced demand for products occasioned by the electronics industry downturn experienced from to these activities include the closing of facilities and the termination of employees 
because costs are recorded based upon estimates  actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if the initial estimates are too low or too high  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods or to reverse previously recorded expenses 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods 
we expect to continue to restructure our operations and incur restructuring and severance costs as explained in cost management above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we continued our restructuring activities during  recording restructuring and severance costs of million  and recording related asset write downs of million 
our restructuring programs initiated in are part of a plan to reduce annual fixed costs by approximately million 
we are also investigating other cost savings initiatives to generate an additional million in annual cost savings beginning in our restructuring program has been on going since we recorded restructuring and severance costs for the years ended december    and of million  million  million  and million  respectively 
we also recorded asset write downs of million  million  million  and million during the years ended december     and  respectively 
we have realized  and expect to continue to realize  annual cost savings associated with the restructuring activities initiated in    and restructuring and severance costs are separate from plant closure  employee termination and similar integration costs we incur in connection with our acquisition activities 
these amounts are included in the costs of our acquisitions and do not affect earnings or losses on our statement of operations 
other income expense compared to interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million as compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the repurchase of million of our liquid yield option notes lyons during the second quarter of  partially offset by an increase in the interest rate on our variable rate exchangeable notes 
the following tables analyze the components of the line other on the consolidated statement of operations in thousands years ended december  change foreign exchange gain loss interest income dividend income losses on disposal of property and equipment other incentive from chinese government favorable settlement of note receivable the year ended december  includes a one time gain of million due to the favorable settlement of an outstanding note receivable 
there was no comparable item in compared to interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to repayment of debt with the proceeds of lower interest rate debt issued in the third quarter of these proceeds  from our issuance of our convertible subordinated notes  were used to repay approximately million principal amount of general semiconductor s convertible notes  approximately million accreted principal amount of our lyons and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the third quarter of additionally  on june   we repurchased million accreted principal amount of our lyons through the issuance of  shares of common stock 
we recorded a loss of million for extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  on the redemption of million principal amount of the general semiconductor notes and the repurchase of million in accreted principal amount of our lyons 
also during  we recorded a gain of million on the receipt of insurance proceeds in excess of book value subsequent to the destruction of the thin film resistor facility of our electro films  inc subsidiary in warwick  rhode island 
that facility has now been completely rebuilt into a state of the art production center

there were no comparable items in the year ended december  included a gain on expiration of an interest rate swap of million  and there was no comparable item in minority interest minority interest in earnings decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to our acquisition of the minority interest in siliconix on may  siliconix earnings for the year to date period through may  were lower than for the comparable prior year period 
minority interest in earnings increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in net earnings of siliconix  of which we owned of the outstanding shares during those years 
income taxes the effective tax rate  based on earnings before income taxes and minority interest  for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  income tax expense for was impacted by benefits totaling million  primarily due to favorable foreign tax rulings 
the effective tax rates for reflect this net benefit  partially offset by the non deductibility of certain items  including the write off of in process research and development and siliconix transaction related expenses 
income tax expense for was also impacted by the favorable completion of an audit of our consolidated us tax returns for the years through  and related carryback years  offset by the tax impact of repatriating million of earnings that had previously been expected to be reinvested outside of the united states indefinitely 
the repatriation allowed us to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards in the united states 
the net tax expense of these items was immaterial 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  reflects the favorable settlement of a tax audit in germany  which resulted in a decrease in tax expense of million 
the effective tax rates for   and reflect the fact that we could not recognize for accounting purposes the tax benefit of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  although these losses are available to offset future taxable income 
under applicable accounting principles  we may not recognize deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where there is a recent history of cumulative losses  where there is no taxable income in the carryback period  where there is insufficient evidence of future earnings to overcome the loss history and where there is no other positive evidence  such as the likely reversal of taxable temporary differences  that would result in the utilization of loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  we had an additional million invested in highly liquid short term investments as of december  approximately million of our cash balance at december  was held by our non us subsidiaries 
this compares to approximately of our cash held by non us subsidiaries at december  during the third quarter of  we repatriated approximately million of earnings generated by our non us subsidiaries 
under non us tax law  any repatriation of earnings and cash back to the united states is deemed to be a dividend and is subject to us income taxes  state income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes 
at the present time  we expect our remaining cash and profits generated by foreign subsidiaries to continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
our financial condition as of december  continued to be strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  compared to a ratio of to at december  the increase in this ratio is primarily due to the payment of various liabilities  including the payment of accrued restructuring costs at various locations 
our ratio of long term debt  less current portion  to stockholders equity was to at december   as compared to a ratio of to at december  the improvement in this ratio during is primarily due to an increase in equity as a result of our issuance of common stock to complete the acquisition of the siliconix minority interest 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   despite increased earnings 
the decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital resulting from cash payments related to our restructuring activities and for purchases of tantalum under our purchase commitments with cabot 
cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the prior year 
in  we made an additional million of capital expenditures pursuant to capital lease agreements 
our capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million in  principally to expand capacity in the semiconductors businesses 
purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired  of million for represents the cash paid to acquire si technologies  the assets of cyoptics israel  and alpha electronics kk  plus cash paid for direct acquisition costs related to the purchase of the minority interest of siliconix 
purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired  of million for represents cash payments for the acquisition of the assets of rfwaves and aeroflex pearl river  inc renamed vishay mic technology  inc  and payments made related to liabilities assumed from previous acquisitions 
our debt levels are essentially the same at december  as they were at december   primarily due to approximately million of debt assumed in the alpha electronics kk transaction and accretion of interest on our lyons of approximately million  offset by repayments of amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility of million 
at december   we had committed and uncommitted short term credit lines with various us and foreign banks aggregating approximately million  of which approximately million was unused 
we maintain a secured revolving credit facility of million  which expires in may at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  as compared to million outstanding at december  the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  represented million borrowed by our asian subsidiary 
these amounts were fully repaid in the second quarter of the revolving credit facility restricts us from paying cash dividends and requires us to comply with other covenants  including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  pursuant to the amended and restated credit facility agreement  we must maintain a tangible net worth of million plus of net income without offset for losses and of net proceeds of equity offerings since july  our tangible net worth at december   as calculated pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  was  million  which is million more than the minimum required under the related credit facility covenant 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by pledges of stock in certain significant subsidiaries and certain guarantees by significant subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries would be required to perform under the guarantees in the event that vishay failed to make principal or interest payments under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to the acquisition of the minority interest in siliconix  siliconix became a party to our revolving credit agreement 
certain of vishay s other subsidiaries are also permitted to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
any borrowings of these subsidiaries under the credit facility are guaranteed by vishay 
while the timing and location of scheduled payments for certain liabilities may require us to draw on our revolving credit facilities from time to time  for the next twelve months  management expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements  to meet our obligations under restructuring and acquisition integration programs  and to fund our research and development and capital expenditure plans 
acquisition activity may require additional borrowing under our revolving credit facilities or may otherwise require us to incur additional debt 
additionally  if the holders of the lyons exercise their option to require vishay to repurchase the notes at their accreted value on june   we expect to be able to utilize our revolving credit facility or vishay common stock to finance the repurchase 
the accreted value of all currently outstanding lyons would be approximately million on june  contractual commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital and operating leases expected pension and postretirement plan funding estimated costs to complete construction in progress purchase commitments tantalum purchase commitments tower purchase commitments other total contractual cash obligations pursuant to the terms of the lyons due  the remaining holders of the lyons will have the right to put these notes to us on june   june   and june  at their accreted values on those dates  as set forth in the notes 
the aggregate purchase price for the june put date would be approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible subordinated notes due  the holders of these notes will have the right to put these notes to us on august   august   august  and august  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes million 
the commitments set forth in the table are based on the stated maturity dates and do not assume acceleration of payment pursuant to the respective options of the holders 
commitments for interest payments on long term debt are based on the stated maturity dates of each agreement  one of which bears a maturity date of various factors could have a material effect on the amount of future interest payments 
these factors include the facts that substantially all of our debt instruments are convertible into common stock  that the holders of our lyons due and our convertible subordinated notes due have an option to put these notes to us on specified dates  and that interest commitments for our variable rate exchangeable notes due are based on the rate prevailing at december  commitments for interest payments on long term debt also include commitment fees under our revolving credit facility  which expires in may we maintain long term foundry agreements with subcontractors to ensure access to external front end capacity for our semiconductor products 
our siliconix division has an agreement with tower semiconductor  pursuant to which we will place orders valued at approximately million for the purchase of semiconductor wafers to be manufactured in tower s fab facility over a seven to ten year period 
the agreement specifies minimum quantities per month and a fixed quantity for the term of the agreement 
we must pay for any short fall in minimum order quantities specified under the agreement 
acceleration of wafer delivery generally relieves obligations in the later years of the agreement 
the commitments set forth above represent the minimum monthly quantities per year 
we expect our orders to approximate this delivery schedule 
in  our siliconix division entered a five year foundry agreement for semiconductor manufacturing with a subcontractor in japan 
the agreement calls for siliconix to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of estimated requirements 
the first six months of this forecast are fixed as to quantity  and the subsequent six months are guaranteed not to be less than a quantity stated in the agreement 
thereafter  the monthly quantity may vary based on market demand 
under the agreement siliconix must guarantee that its business with this subcontractor represents a minimum percentage of wafer requirements and is required to use its best efforts not to reduce the average monthly demand rate below a specified threshold best efforts threshold 
the purchase commitments in the table above represent the minimum commitments for year one based on the fixed quantities for months one through six and the minimum average quantities for months seven through twelve  and the expected minimum commitment based on the best efforts threshold for the remainder of the agreement 
our actual purchases in future periods are expected to be greater than these minimum commitments 
generally accepted accounting principles require that management evaluate if purchase commitments are at prices in excess of current market price 
the purchase commitments for silicon wafers entered by siliconix are for the manufacture of proprietary products using siliconix owned technology licensed to these subcontractors by siliconix  and accordingly  management can only estimate the market price of the wafers which are the subject of these commitments 
management believes that these commitments are at prices which are not in excess of estimated current market prices

inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements several new accounting pronouncements were issued during  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these new standards  some of which are not effective until future periods  is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our floating rate revolving credit facility 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under this facility  as compared to million at december  on a selective basis  we from time to time enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements to reduce the potential negative impact that increases in interest rates could have on our outstanding variable rate debt 
the impact of interest rate instruments on our results of operations in each of the three years ended december    and was not significant 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for components of our long term debt and interest rate swap arrangements 
in august  we entered into six interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million to manage interest rate risk related to our multicurrency revolving line of credit 
as of december   five of these six agreements had been terminated 
the remaining agreement had a notional amount of million and required us to make payments to the counterparty at variable rates based on usd libor bba rates 
this agreement expired in during the year ended december   we had a pretax gain of approximately million related to the expiration of the final swap agreement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk many of our products require the use of raw materials that are produced in only a limited number of regions around the world or are available from only a limited number of suppliers 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price increases for these raw materials 
for example  the prices for tantalum and palladium  two raw materials that we use in our capacitors  are subject to fluctuation 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we recorded substantial write downs of tantalum and palladium in the economic downturn from to  and recorded more modest write downs in foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in germany  france  israel and asia 
in most locations  we have introduced a netting policy where subsidiaries pay all intercompany balances within thirty days 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements  currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities and collectibility of accounts receivable
