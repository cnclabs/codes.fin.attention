the company does not purchase  or commit to purchase  quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within one year 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual amounts will differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
sales returns 
an allowance is established for possible return of products 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
also  the company s written agreements with distributors typically limit the amount that may be returned 
although management considers these balances adequate  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
excess and discontinued inventory 
the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for excess and discontinued product are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these balances adequate  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs impairment testing for goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for goodwill  the company performs impairment reviews for the company s reporting units  which have been determined to be the company s reportable segments using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting units by an allocation of market capitalization value  cross checked by a present value of future cash flows calculation 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
the company also performs a separate impairment test for each other intangible asset with indefinite life  based on estimated future use and discounting estimated future cash flows 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests 
though management considers its judgments and assumptions to be reasonable  changes in product offerings or marketing strategies could change the estimated fair values and result in impairment charges 
product warranty 
a liability is established for estimated warranty and service claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales 
the company estimates these costs based on historical claim experience  changes in warranty programs and other factors  including evaluating specific product warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
self insurance 
the company purchases insurance for products liability  workers compensation and employee medical benefits with high deductibles 
third party insurance is carried for what is believed to be the major portion of potential exposures that would exceed the company s self insured retentions 
the company has established liabilities for potential uninsured claims  including estimated costs and legal fees 
the company employs actuaries to assist in evaluating its potential ultimate exposure for uninsured claims and then considers factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  sales trends and other relevant factors in setting the liabilities 
though management considers these balances adequate  a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims would result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal  state and international issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits 
retirement obligations 
the measurements of the company s pension and post retirement medical obligations are dependent on a number of assumptions including estimates of the present value of projected future payments  taking into consideration future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an impact on the expense and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include discount rates  inflation  salary increases  retirement rates  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
for us plans  the company based its discount rate assumption at year end on the citigroup pension liability index  a published index commonly used as a benchmark 
in the prior year  the company determined its discount rate assumption based on the prevailing interest rate on long term corporate bonds rated aa as quoted by moody s investor services  an established credit rating agency 
the company changed its reference index because it believes the pension liability index relates more closely to pension cash flows 
the company bases its inflation assumption on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary assumptions are based on actual historical experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement rates are based on experience 
the investment return assumption is based on the expected long term performance of plan assets 
in setting this number  the company considers the input of actuaries and investment advisors  its long term historical returns  the allocation of plan assets  and projected returns on plan assets 
mortality rates are based on a common group mortality table for males and females 
net pension income in was million and was allocated to cost of products sold and operating expenses based on salaries and wages 
at december   a one half percentage point decrease in the indicated assumptions would have the following effects in millions assumption funded status expense discount rate expected return on assets new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r that requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
this standard will be adopted by the company starting with the beginning of fiscal year under the modified prospective method 
management estimates that the effect of the adoption of sfas r on net earnings for fiscal will be approximately million 
the company s actual share based compensation expense in fiscal will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
this standard clarifies the accounting for abnormal inventory costs and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the new standard  effective for the company starting in  will not have an impact on operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
the company may use a variety of financial and derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may use forward exchange contracts  options and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from anticipated currency transactions and net monetary asset and liability positions 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound and korean won 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of foreign currency rate changes  however  the direct translation effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
when compared to results  the weaker us dollar versus foreign currencies helped to increase sales and net earnings 
for the year ended december   the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall increase in net sales and net earnings of approximately million and million  respectively 
long term outlook the company does not provide analysts or shareholders with specific targets for net sales or net earnings 
rather  management is committed to achieving its stated financial objectives over a long term time horizon 
the company s financial objectives are net sales growth exceeding percent annually net earnings growth exceeding percent annually return on sales exceeding percent return on assets exceeding percent return on equity exceeding percent outlook the company is expecting higher net sales and net earnings in this expectation is based on management s belief that most of the company s major markets will continue to experience favorable economic conditions in it is important to note that management s vision regarding future sales activity is limited due to the small backlog that the company carries 
in addition to economic growth  the improved sales outlook is dependent upon many factors  including the successful launch of new products  expanding distribution coverage  price increases and the successful management and integration of acquisitions 
the earnings outlook assumes higher sales  continued improvements in manufacturing which minimize cost increases including purchased commodities  the continued disciplined management of operating expenses and the successful management and integration of acquisitions 
the company is evaluating alternatives to improve the operations of the businesses acquired in the company expects that changing or expiring tax law will increase its effective tax rate to percentage points and therefore will impact net earnings 
forward looking statements a forward looking statement is any statement made in this report and other reports that the company files periodically with the securities and exchange commission  or in press or earnings releases  analyst briefings  conference calls and the company s annual report to shareholders which reflects the company s current thinking on market trends and the company s future financial performance at the time they are made 
all forecasts and projections are forward looking statements 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of by making cautionary statements concerning any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company cannot give any assurance that the results forecasted in any forward looking statement will actually be achieved 
future results could differ materially from those expressed  due to the impact of changes in various factors 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the united states and other major world economies  currency fluctuations  political instability  changes in laws and regulations  and changes in product demand 
please refer to item a of  and exhibit to the company s annual report on form k for fiscal year for a more comprehensive discussion of these and other risk factors 
investors should realize that factors other than those identified above and in exhibit might prove important to the company s future results 
it is not possible for management to identify each and every factor that may have an impact on the company s operations in the future as new factors can develop from time to time
