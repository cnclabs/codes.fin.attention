the forward looking statements are based upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  economic conditions  competitive conditions  development success rates  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  including in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
as a result of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the forward looking matters discussed may not occur 
overview we are a growing independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore natural gas and oil reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on the exploration and development of coalbed methane  or cbm  properties located in the rocky mountain region and on our waterflood oil recovery programs in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contribute drilling locations  pay tangible drilling costs and provide turnkey drilling services  natural gas marketing services and well services to the drilling partnerships and retain an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
from december to march  drilling programs formed from though converted from delaware limited partnerships to delaware limited liability companies 
as a result of these conversions  we issued an aggregate of  restricted convertible preferred shares to the llcs as additional capital contributions and received as consideration additional standard membership interests in the llcs 
this increased our pro rata beneficial interests in the oil and gas wells owned by the llcs 
also during  we issued an aggregate of  restricted convertible preferred shares to two joint ventures as additional capital contributions and received as consideration additional joint venture interests in the joint ventures  which increased our pro rata beneficial interests in the oil and gas wells owned by the joint ventures 
we anticipate that revenue from turnkey drilling services will become increasingly less material to our business in the future 
our future revenue growth is primarily dependent on our ability to increase our oil and gas reserves and production 
we plan to participate in all our wyoming drilling activities on a pro rata basis with our drilling programs until we have performed our obligations under the turnkey drilling contracts related to our existing deferred income of approximately million as of december  after we have performed our obligations under the turnkey drilling contracts we intend to invest more of our own capital in drilling operations in order to accelerate the growth of our production and reserves 
we also anticipate that any future drilling activities that we undertake with third parties will be through joint ventures and similar arrangements 
the schedule below reflects revenue and expense from gas and oil sales and from turnkey contracts for the years ended december  and oil and gas sales production and exploration expense depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment gross margin turnkey contract revenue with affiliated partnerships turnkey contract expense depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment gross margin we estimate that the completion of drilling activities on behalf of our drilling programs and the subsequent commencement of drilling activities primarily for our own account will occur in we anticipate that  depending upon our drilling results  our production revenue may not be sufficient for us to achieve positive cash flow from operating activities on or before the end of even if we are able to achieve positive cash flow from operating activities on or before the end of  which we cannot assume  we may not be able to achieve positive cash flow from operating activities on a cumulative basis for to the extent we are able to achieve increases in natural gas and oil production revenue  we also will experience increases in production and exploration expense 
liquidity and capital resources during december  we sold million shares in a secondary offering raising net proceeds of million 
during the first eleven months of  we raised million from private sales of our common stock and warrants  and through the exercise of stock options 
during december  we sold million shares of common stock in an initial public offering raising net proceeds of million 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million during this resulted from an increase in cash flows provided by financing activities of million 
this was offset by a decrease in cash used in investing activities of million and a decrease in cash used in operating activities of million 
currently our assets are unencumbered  except for restricted investments in us treasury bonds 
as a result the company may seek to obtain bank financing to fund future activities 
cash provided by financing activities of million results from a secondary offering raising net proceeds of million as mentioned above 
this increase in cash was offset by the early redemption of certain debentures for cash totaling million and dividends paid on preferred stock totaling million 
during  we reduced our outstanding debenture balance from million to million by either converting the debentures into common stock or by redeeming the debentures for cash 
cash used in investing activities of million results from million for expenditures on oil and gas properties offset by the release of million in us treasury bonds relating to the redemption of debentures discussed above 
cash used in operating activities of million primarily relates to drilling wells on behalf of our drilling programs and oil and gas operations 
another commitment of funds relates to the drilling programs 
our deferred revenue balance relating to our drilling commitments totaled million at december  this commitment approximates net wells  primarily in the washakie basin  to be drilled on behalf of our drilling programs formed in and prior 
the company had a net loss before dividends of million for  as compared to a net loss before dividends of million for at december   current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately million 
during the second quarter of  the company and the preferred holders agreed by greater than the requisite majority that a dividend be paid in kind with warren resources common stock for the accrued dividend for the quarters ended march and june   amounting to approximately million 
accordingly  warren issued total of  shares of its common stock as a dividend 
accrued dividends as of december  were approximately million 
capital expenditure program our capital expenditure budget for is million  which includes participation in the drilling of gross net wells 
at the present time  we are concentrating our drilling activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit wtu and the north wilimington unit nwu 
additionally  we have three projects in wyoming  the atlantic rim and pacific rim projects in the washakie basin and an exploratory project 
we are planning to drill gross net producing and injecting wells in california with capital expenditures estimated at million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the wtu with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to recomplete or drill gross net wells in the nwu with estimated capital expenditures of million 
also  we plan to drill producing and injecting wells in wyoming with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the atlantic rim project with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the pacific rim project with estimated capital expenditures of million 
lastly  we plan on drilling one exploratory well in wyoming with estimated capital expenditures of million 
the final determination regarding whether to drill the budgeted wells referred to above is dependent upon many factors including the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated energy prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
our estimated total proved reserves as of december  are approximately billion cubic feet of gas equivalent bcfe with a pv value of approximately million using december  oil and gas pricing 
approximately of our estimated net proved reserves are undeveloped 
compared with the development of our cbm properties  we anticipate that development of our oil properties in california could have a more immediate impact on our cash flows 
we also anticipate that we will be able to conduct drilling operations in california on a year round basis without weather induced or other drilling delays as may occur in the rocky mountain areas where our cbm properties are located 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility together with a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors 
stock based equity compensation plan information at december   we had approximately million vested outstanding stock options issued under our stock based equity compensation plans 
of the total million outstanding vested options  all had exercise prices below the closing market price of our common stock on december  if such options are exercised by the holders  we will receive the exercise price in cash 
the following table provides information with respect to shares of our common stock that may be issued under vested stock options whose exercise price was less than our closing stock price on december  exercise price of outstanding vested options number of securities to be issued upon exercise of vested outstanding options proceeds to be received upon exercise of vested outstanding options for additional detail about our stock based equity compensation plans  see executive compensation employee benefit plans under item and as incorporated by reference from our proxy statement on form a 
critical accounting policies oil and gas producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this methodology  costs incurred to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed 
unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are periodically assessed for impairment of value and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance 
other unproved properties are amortized based on our experience of successful drilling  terms of leases and historical lease expirations 
capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties are depleted by the units of production method on a field by field basis 
lease costs are depleted using total proved reserves while lease equipment and intangible development costs are depleted using proved developed reserves 
our proved properties are evaluated on a field by field basis for impairment 
an impairment loss is indicated whenever net capitalized costs exceed expected future net cash flow based on engineering estimates 
in this circumstance  we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the properties exceeds the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flow 
on the sale or retirement of a complete unit of a proved property  the cost and related accumulated depletion and amortization are eliminated from the property accounts  and the resulting gain or loss is recognized 
on the retirement or sale of a partial unit of proved property  the cost is charged to accumulated depletion and amortization with a resulting gain or loss recognized in earnings 
on the sale of an entire interest in an unproved property  a gain or loss on the sale is recognized  taking into consideration the amount of any recorded impairment if the property had been assessed individually 
if a partial interest in an unproved property is sold  the amount received is treated as a reduction of the cost of the interest retained 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates depends in part on the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
revenue recognition affiliated partnerships enter into agreements with us to drill wells to completion for a fixed price 
we  in turn  enter into drilling contracts primarily with unrelated parties to drill wells on a day work basis 
therefore  if problems are encountered on a well  the cost of that well will increase and gross profit will decrease and could result in a loss on the well 
we recognize revenue from the turnkey drilling agreements on a proportional performance method as services are performed 
this involves management making judgments and estimates as to their various stage of completion of each well based on the review of drilling logs  status reports from engineers and historical experience in completing similar wells 
when estimates of future revenues and expenses on a specific contract indicate a loss will be incurred  the total estimated loss is accrued 
oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by us in various oil and gas properties 
sales of natural gas and oil produced are recognized when delivered to or picked up by the purchaser 
oil and gas sales from marketing activities result from sales by us of oil and gas produced by affiliated joint ventures and partnerships and are recognized when delivered to purchasers 
well services revenue is recognized when services are performed 
new accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued sfas no

r focuses primarily on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
sfas r must be adopted no later than january  and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
the estimated future expense relating to unvested options at january   that are vesting during and totals approximately  in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable in which the changes should be applied to the latest practicable date presented for voluntary accounting changes and in the absence of specific guidance provided for in a new pronouncement issued by an authoritative body 
sfas also requires that a correction of an error be reported as a prior period adjustment by restating prior period financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in april  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting for suspended well costs 
fsp fas amended sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies sfas  to allow continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year from the completion of drilling under circumstances where the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
fsp fas also amended sfas to require enhanced disclosures of suspended exploratory well costs in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted the new requirements during the fourth quarter of the adoption of fsp fas did not impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

in such an event  debentures not converted may be called by us upon days notice at a price of of par value plus accrued interest 
we have issued secured debentures 
the principal of the secured debentures is secured at maturity by zero coupon us treasury bonds previously deposited into an escrow account equaling the par value of the debentures maturing on or before the due date of the debentures 
the table below reflects the outstanding debentures by issue  the fair market value of the zero coupon us treasury bonds held in escrow on behalf of the debentures holders and the estimated cash outlay for the payment of debenture interest for the conversion prices listed below will increase in the future

during   shares of our convertible preferred stock converted into common shares on a for basis and  shares of preferred stock converted into common shares on a to basis 
dividends and accretion on preferred shares totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of our outstanding preferred stock has a dividend equal to per annum  payable to the extent legally available quarterly in arrears  and a liquidation preference of per share 
any accrued but unpaid dividends shall be cumulative and paid upon liquidation  optional redemption or conditional repurchase 
no dividends may be paid on the common stock as long as there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 
the following describes the conversion rate applicable to the preferred shares outstanding at december  at the election of the holder of our convertible preferred stock  until june   each share of preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock  and commencing july  and thereafter  each share of preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock 
the conversion rate for our convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment in the event of the issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock  the combination  subdivision or reclassification of the common stock  or the distribution to all holders of common stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets  including securities issued by third parties  but excluding cash dividends or distributions paid out of surplus 
commencing seven years after their respective date of issuance  the preferred stock may be redeemed by the holders at a redemption price equal to the liquidation value of per share  plus accrued but unpaid dividends  if any 
at december   there were  preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to redeem during the year ended december   and thereafter   preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to be redeemed during the year ended december  and thereafter 
upon receipt of a redemption election  we  at our option  shall either pay the holder cash in an amount equal to per convertible preferred share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends or stock exchanges  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  to the extent that we have funds legally available for redemption  or issue to the holder shares of common stock in an amount equal to of the cash redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends  based on the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date of the receipt of the written redemption election by the holder  as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or by any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded 
in the event that we elect to pay the redemption price in kind with our common stock  for each million shares of preferred stock representing million of redemption price value  notwithstanding the market price of our common stock  we shall not issue to the redeeming preferred stockholders less than their proportionate share of million of our shares of common stock  nor be obligated to issue more than million shares of our common stock in full satisfaction of the redemption  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends and stock exchanges 
if we are not listed on an exchange or our common stock has no trading volume  upon redemption the board shall determine the fair market value of the common stock 
if the closing sale price of our publicly traded common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded  exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for the preferred stock for at least trading days during any day period  we  at our option  may either redeem the preferred stock in whole or in part  at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  or convert the preferred stock  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends  into common stock at the then applicable conversion rate  based on the average closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption 
in addition  the preferred stock  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  shall be converted into common stock at the then applicable conversion rate upon the vote or written consent of the holders of of the then outstanding preferred stock  voting together as a class 
accordingly  if the holders of any of the then remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock request redemption commencing in and thereafter and we elect to pay the redemption price for the preferred stock in cash  we would need capital of per share  plus the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividends  which funds may not be available and the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial liquidity and results of operation 
alternatively  if we elect to pay the redemption price for the preferred stock commencing in and thereafter with shares of our common stock  such issuance could materially increase the number of our shares of common stock then outstanding and be dilutive to our earnings per share  if any 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations table below assumes the maximum amount is tendered each year 
the table does not give effect to the conversion of any bonds to common stock which would reduce payments due 
as described in more detail in the debentures section above  all debentures are secured at maturity by zero coupon us treasury bonds deposited into an escrow account equaling the par value of the debentures maturing on or before the maturity of the debentures 
payments due by period contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years more than years debentures drilling commitments leases total the contractual obligation schedule above does not reflect million principal amount of zero coupon us treasury bonds held by us in escrow to secure the repayment of the debentures upon maturity 
such us treasury bonds had a fair market value of million at december  the company has a contract with nabors well services co 
contractor for drilling wells in california that expires september  the contract provides for an operating rate of  per day 
in the event of early termination  a shortfall charge of  per day is incurred for each day prior to the initial termination date  which is limited to a maximum of the company has a contract with caza drilling inc contractor for drilling wells in california that expires october  the contract provides for an operating rate of  per day 
in the event of early termination  the company will incur a force majeure rate of  per day for each day prior to the initial termination date and actual cost incurred by the contractor  for a maximum of  in off balance sheet arrangements under the terms of our drilling programs formed from to  investors have the right to tender their interest back to the drilling program and other program investors during the period from seven to years after the date of the partnership s formation 
the tender rights were included to make such programs more attractive to potential investor partners  thereby enabling the company to obtain more capital to drill more oil and gas wells 
to the extent that an investor tenders a drilling program interest for sale and the drilling program and other investors elect not to repurchase the withdrawing partner s interest  we will be required to repurchase the interest from the investor 
the price of our repurchase is fixed by the drilling program agreement to be the lower of the pv value of the assets of the program and a formula based on the amount of the investor s cash investment reduced by the amount of any cash distributions received 
as of december   based on the december  reserve reports of the respective drilling programs  the aggregate pv value of the assets in these programs is million 
because this pv value is less than the formula price of million at december   the maximum repurchase price obligation at december  was million 
this pv value would be higher if current prices for crude oil and natural gas were to increase when we drill the remaining net wells or place the remaining net wells on production on behalf of these seven drilling programs 
in the event of repurchase  we receive the investor s interest in the program  which includes the investor s beneficial share of the program s reserves and related future net cash flows 
there are no known events that would result in termination of the material benefits of our off balance sheet arrangements except for a decrease in oil and gas pricing that occurs after an acquisition 
the only material off balance sheet benefit of this arrangement is the acquisition of proved reserves 
to the extent that we acquire interests for their pv value based on this arrangement  and declining oil and natural gas prices  or other factors  render those interests less valuable  a material reduction in the benefit of this arrangement to the company would occur 
the table below presents the projected timing of our maximum potential repurchase commitment associated with these programs as of december  amount of repurchase commitment per period less than year years years more than years total in thousands maximum potential repurchase commitment based on the partnership reserves taken from the williamson partnership reserve report as of december  and using pricing at that date
