item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses  income and expenses pertaining to other real estate owned  gains and losses from sales of loans and securities and non interest income and expenses 
non interest expenses consist principally of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  data processing  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  marketing  professional services and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may materially affect the company 
the company has taken steps to grow in size and geographic reach and expects to be able to expand its deposit gathering activities with the development of new products and services and improve its overall competitive position and support internal growth through lending in the communities it serves 
the company s growth objectives also include merger and acquisition activities  where appropriate 
completed acquisitions as of december  are connecticut bancshares  alliance and trust company 
the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance were completed in conjunction with the bank s conversion from mutual to capital stock form on april  the acquisition of trust company was completed on july  unless otherwise defined  references to the acquisitions would refer to these three transactions 
the company also completed its acquisition of cornerstone on january  effective december   the company changed its fiscal year end to december from march for and  the fiscal years were for twelve month periods whereas for  the fiscal year was for a nine month period 
due to this change in fiscal year ends  management s discussion and analysis of operating results will compare the following periods fiscal year ended december  to the fiscal year ended december   and the fiscal year ended december  to the comparative twelve month period ended december  this presentation will improve comparability of results of operations for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessment  are as follows 
additional information related to the company s accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
income taxes management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
management uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
management must assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset  including the carryforward of a portion of the charitable contribution  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
however  certain changes could be charged or credited to equity or goodwill 
pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense 
intangible assets the company is required to follow sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets for business acquisitions and the subsequent accounting for intangible assets acquired 
for business acquisitions  sfas no 
requires us to record as assets on our financial statements both goodwill  an intangible asset which is equal to the excess of the purchase price which we pay for another company over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired  and identifiable intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles and non compete agreements 
under sfas no 
 goodwill must be regularly evaluated for impairment  in which case we may be required to reduce its carrying value through a charge to earnings 
core deposit and other identifiable intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not have future economic benefit 
the valuation techniques used by management to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates  which were used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights represent the present value of future servicing fees from the right to service loans sold 
the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights requires the development of a number of estimates  the most critical of which is assumed mortgage loan prepayment speeds  which is significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
in general  during periods of falling interest rates  the mortgage loans prepay faster and the value of the company s mortgage servicing assets decline 
conversely  during periods of rising rates  the value of mortgage servicing rights generally increases due to slower rates of prepayments 
the amount and timing of mortgage servicing rights amortization is adjusted quarterly based on actual results and updated projections 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  management performs a valuation review of mortgage servicing rights for potential declines in value that may include obtaining an independent appraisal of the fair value of our servicing portfolio 
this quarterly valuation review entails applying current assumptions to the portfolio stratified by predominant risk characteristics such as loan type  interest rate and loan term 
other than temporary impairment of securities on a monthly basis management performs an impairment review of investment securities for potential other than temporary declines in fair value 
significant judgment is involved in determining when a decline in fair market value is considered other than temporary 
some of these judgments related to the investment include financial condition  earnings prospects  adverse events causing the decline that are not expected to reverse in the near term  declines in debt ratings  and length of time that fair value has been below cost 
when recognized  other than temporary declines in fair value are recorded in the income statement within net security gains 
amortization and accretion on investment securities premiums and discounts on fixed income securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the term of the security using the level yield method 
for investments with a stated maturity  premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the contractual terms of the related security 
the company has a significant portfolio of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the average life can vary significantly depending on prepayment of the underlying mortgage loans 
therefore  the prepayment speed assumption is critical to this accounting estimate 
at purchase date  management uses prepayment speed assumptions from reputable sources 
then  for purposes of computing amortization or accretion on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  management adjusts the prepayment speed assumptions on a regular basis 
included in the mortgage backed securities are hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with reset dates ranging between three and seven years 
premium amortization or discount accretion on these hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities is generally based on a prepayment rate applied up to the initial reset date 
in the current interest rate environment  management has experienced significant prepayments on these hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities by the time of or immediately following the initial reset date 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds require an acceleration of the premium amortization or discount accretion for these mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and and the twelve months ended december  table summary income statements ended change year ended december  december  dollars in thousands  except per share data amount percent amount percent net interest income     provision for loan losses non interest income     operating expenses     contribution to newalliance foundation  conversion and merger related charges    income before income taxes     income tax expense     net income basic and diluted earnings per share n a n a earnings summary as shown in table  net income increased by million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in earnings was primarily a result of higher net interest income and non interest income  lower conversion and merger charges related to the connecticut bancshares and alliance acquisitions completed on april  and the contribution in to the foundation  partially offset by increased operating and income tax expenses 
the rise in net interest income was driven primarily by an increase in average net interest earning assets of million resulting from the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance and growth in the loan and investment securities portfolios subsequent to these acquisitions 
higher non interest income and non interest expenses were predominantly due to the acquisitions  costs associated with being a public company and expenses related to the implementation of the long term compensation plan ltcp in june of the contribution of company stock to the foundation was a one time event 
due to an increase in market interest rates  the average yield earned increased for all categories of interest earning assets and the average rate paid increased in virtually all categories of interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on the total of all interest bearing liabilities increased more than the increase in the average yield earned on the total of all interest earning assets  causing a decrease of basis points in the interest rate spread for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  however  this interest rate spread decrease did not lead to a decline in net interest income as the decrease in spread was mitigated by the increase in the net interest earning assets average balance of million primarily as a result of the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in april of overall  net interest income increased million 
non interest income increased due to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in and trust company in and income resulting from non recurring transactions 
these increases were partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits resulting from the acquisitions and the implementation of the ltcp 
net income decreased by million  to million for the year ended december  from net income of million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in earnings was primarily the result of increased operating expenses  conversion and merger charges and the contribution to the foundation  all of which are directly related to the connecticut bancshares and alliance acquisitions and the conversion to a stock bank 
this decrease was partially offset by higher net interest and non interest income  also primarily due to these two acquisitions 
the rise in net interest income for the year ended december  was driven by an increase in interest earning assets of billion due to the acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned resulting from the lower interest rate environment 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities of billion was less than the increase in average interest bearing assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  which also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
higher non interest income and non interest expenses were due to the expansion of the company s geographic area due to the acquisitions  costs associated with being a public company and the contribution to the foundation 
the contribution of company stock to the then newly formed foundation at the time of the conversion from a mutual to a stock savings bank is a one time event

the determination of proforma net earnings excludes the effects of conversion and merger related charges and contribution to the foundation  which the company considers to be non operating  but does not exclude other non related  nonrecurring items 
these conversion and merger related charges include accounting  legal  consulting and branding expenses directly associated with the acquisitions 
performance measured by proforma net earnings is considered by management to be a useful measure for gauging the underlying performance of the company by eliminating the volatility caused by voluntary transaction based items 
presented in table is a reconciliation of gaap based net income to proforma net earnings 
as reflected in the table  proforma net earnings for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million 
conversion and merger related charges for primarily included trust company costs and the commencement of the cornerstone costs 
management anticipates that the acquisition of cornerstone will cause these costs to continue in for the year ended december   proforma net earnings were million 
the primary reasons for the difference between the gaap net income and proforma net earnings were the contribution to the foundation of million after tax million and connecticut bancshares and alliance conversion and merger related charges of million after tax million 
the twelve month period ended december  was also affected by conversion and merger related charges in the amount of million after tax million 
the conversion to a stock bank occurred on april   resulting in shares outstanding only for the nine months ended december  therefore  earnings per share for the year ended december  and the twelve months ended december  are not shown in tables or further information regarding earnings per share can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

table displays net interest income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year 
increases in average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were primarily driven by the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance  the conversion from a mutual savings bank to a stock bank and general increases in loans  investment securities  borrowings and time deposits during the period 
interest and dividend income increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the average rate on earning assets increased basis points to from in the prior period 
investment income increased million  mainly due to an increase in mortgage backed securities income of million due to a basis point increase in the average rate earned and an increase in the average balance of million on these securities 
several factors contributed to the increase in investment income including a the movement of short term investments into higher yielding mortgage backed securities during the second quarter of  b the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in the second quarter of  c additional purchases during  and d a rising market interest rate environment 
income from loans increased million of which million related to increases in average loan balances of million  primarily attributable to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance during the second quarter of  as well as higher originations and loan purchases and million was due to an increase of basis points in the average rate earned on these loans resulting from the general increase in market interest rates during the period 
the cost of funds for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year period 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to from 
interest expense on deposits increased million and was mainly driven by a basis point increase in the average rate paid on time deposits and a million increase in the average balance of time deposits 
the increase was due to market interest rate increases as well as the company s strategy of offering promotional rates to customers who either had or established a checking relationship with the bank 
interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings increased million over the prior year period to million from million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in the average balance of fhlb advances in order for the company to originate and purchase residential mortgages  purchase investment securities and to fund its stock buy back program while taking advantage of special borrowing programs and products currently being offered by the fhlb 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase is due to an increase in average interest earning assets of billion  partially offset by a decrease in the average yield of basis points 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities of billion was less than the increase in interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  which also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
this change in volume was primarily driven by the two acquisitions and the conversion from a mutual savings bank to a stock bank 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparative period ended december   an increase of million  or 
substantially all of the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in the average balance on interest earning assets of billion 
the increase in the average balance was primarily due to funds received from the stock offering and interest earning assets acquired from the connecticut bancshares and alliance transactions that were completed on april  the most significant change occurred in the loan balances  which increased by billion 
higher loan balances were attributable to billion of loans acquired in the two acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in loan balances subsequent to the acquisitions as management focused on integration and customer retention 
the decrease in organic loan growth was driven principally by decreasing originations of new residential and commercial real estate loans  which did not fully compensate for loan payoffs 
the decrease was partially offset by continuing demand in home equity loans and lines of credit and commercial loans and lower prepayment rates 
the basis point decline in the average yield on loans was due to the lower interest rate environment 
average balances for short term investments and investment securities for the twelve months ended december  increased billion  or  which was mainly attributable to the transactions 
the company acquired investment securities of million 
excluding the acquired securities  investment securities increased by million primarily due to investing the net remaining proceeds raised by the initial public offering 
the basis point increase in the average yield on short term investments and investment securities resulted from the ability of the company to move away from investing in short term low yielding assets due to liquidity raised by the initial public offering  as well as a decrease in prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities which resulted in less premium amortization this period versus the same period a year ago 
the cost of funds for the year increased million compared to the prior twelve month period  primarily resulting from the acquisition of connecticut bancshares and alliance 
upon completion of the two transactions the company acquired approximately billion in deposits and approximately million in borrowings 
the increase in interest expense on deposits of million was due to an increase in the average balance of billion  which more than offset the basis point decrease in the average rate paid on these liabilities 
the decrease in the rate paid on time deposits is mainly due to management s competitive positioning and off term pricing strategy 
interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings and repurchase agreements increased million  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the same period in the increase in expense is due primarily to the increase in the average balance  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of these funds 
the decrease in the average yield on these borrowings is a result of the lower rate environment as well as the premium amortization related to the fair value adjustment on acquired borrowings

management performs a monthly review of the loan portfolio  and based on this review determines the level of the provision necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses allowance 
management recorded a provision for loan losses of  for the year ended december  the provision was recorded to partially offset net charge offs during the rd quarter of  the allowance was deemed adequate despite not fully providing for the total year to date net charge offs of million  certain of which were provided for in prior years  as improvements were noted in other asset quality indicators including  nonperforming assets to total assets  nonperforming loans to total loans  the allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans  as well as positive trends in delinquencies 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of  recorded for the year ended december  and no provision recorded for the twelve months ended december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
this compared to the allowance for loan losses of million at december  representing of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
the allowance acquired in the connecticut bancshares and alliance acquisitions was million 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  which represented of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
the reduction in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans reflects growth in lower risk loan portfolios and improved asset quality measures 
management takes a long term view in establishing the loss rates in each risk rating category 
as a result  allowance allocations by risk rating category consider higher levels of charge offs experienced during the last economic downturn beginning in the early s 
during the last significant downturn in the early s  nonperforming assets increased from million of loans in to million loans in subsequent net charge offs and oreo losses reached a peak in at million or of the loan portfolio 
throughout the s  management added to the allowance in response to deterioration in the loan portfolio resulting in a ratio of allowance to total loans of in for the year period ending march   annualized net charge offs were million  million and million  respectively 
including oreo write downs  the three year total losses were million or an average of million per year  which equates to annual credit related losses of of the average loan portfolio during this same three year period 
beginning in  improvements in the local real estate market began to have a positive impact on our customers  and asset quality began to improve 
nonperforming assets were reduced from million at march  to million at march  and continued to decrease on a percent of loans outstanding basis through december  net charge offs to average interest earning loans over the last years have ranged from to and ended fiscal year december  at 
as asset quality indicators for the portfolio  as a whole  continued to improve  management has reduced the loss rates in certain risk rating categories used in the calculation of the allocation for loan losses

the principal categories of non interest income are shown in table the increase in total non interest income of million for the year ended december  from the comparable period in was primarily due to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance in  the resulting expansion of our market and branch network and the acquisition of trust company on july   which more than doubled the company s trust assets under management to billion 
the acquisitions were the main reasons for increases in investment and insurance fees  bank owned life insurance and trust fees 
depositor service charges increased due to new product and service initiatives implemented during as well as the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance 
loan and servicing income increased  due to an increase in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  partially offset by a net decrease in loan fees  principally commercial real estate loan prepayment fees as the prepayment penalty period had expired on many of the loans that prepaid in the increase in other income was largely attributable to several items of a non recurring nature  including interest on income tax refunds  gains on two lease terminations  sales of excess real estate originally acquired in connection with the connecticut bancshares acquisition  and a gain on the sale of a portion of the merchant services book of business 
however  approximately  of the increase in other income is recurring and was due to an increase in amounts earned on the outstanding balances of bank checks processed by a third party vendor  which is also due to the acquisition of connecticut bancshares in non interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  from the twelve months ended december  most of the increase was directly attributable to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance 
depositor service charges increased million with approximately million of the increase due to the acquisitions 
the remaining million increase was due to an increase in check fees and other service charges related to an increase in volume and an increase in atm fees 
loan and servicing income increased  which was comprised of an increase of approximately  resulting from the acquisitions  offset by a decrease in prepayment fees and lower increases in the value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the increase of  in trust fees is primarily due to increased value of assets under management which drives trust fee income 
investment and insurance fees increased million due to the acquisitions given the expansion of our market and branch network and an increase in the number of brokers selling investment and insurance products as well as the favorable market for insurance products during the year 
additionally  the bank established its own broker dealer in the first quarter of thereby realizing higher commissions on sales of investment products 
the million increase in bank owned life insurance was due to assets acquired in the acquisitions 
the million increase in gain on limited partnerships from the prior period was due to a write down in on limited partnerships that was required to reflect the fair value of the partnerships 
the decrease in net gain on sale of loans was due to a decrease in fixed rate mortgage loans originated and sold in the secondary market due to the reduced refinancing activity industry wide

excluding the contribution to the foundation and conversion and merger related charges  non interest expense increased million with almost every expense category rising 
these increases are primarily attributable to the ltcp which was implemented in and additional operating expenses resulting from the acquisitions and the conversion to a public company 
the conversion to a stock bank and the simultaneous acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance occurred on april  therefore  the current year expenses include twelve months of the combined banks  whereas the prior year expenses include only nine months of the combined banks 
additionally  the acquisition of trust company occurred on july  and has contributed to the increase in current year expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased million primarily due to increases related to the ltcp  increased salaries resulting from the trust company acquisition and higher expenses for medical insurance  pension and employee stock ownership plan esop costs 
esop costs increased due to the three additional months of expense recorded as the esop was established in april of medical insurance and pension costs also increased due to the additional three months as well as an increase of approximately for medical insurance year over year and a decrease in the discount rate used by the company to calculate net periodic benefit cost 
the anticipated earnings impact of the ltcp is discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
occupancy expense increased primarily due to the acquisitions and the opening of a new branch in september of outside services increased million due to increases in audit and data processing fees  partially offset by a decrease in consultant fees 
data 
table of contents processing fees increased due to the increased transactional volume and core system usage related to the outsourcing of certain processing functions of connecticut bancshares and as a result of new processing fees incurred relating to trust company 
audit fees have increased due in part to additional benefit plan audits of the acquired banks and sarbanes oxley sox testing fees 
consultant fees decreased due to costs incurred in the prior year for the completion of a strategic business plan  partially offset by current year costs relating to sox compliance

other expense increased million due to increases in general operating expenses primarily due to the acquisitions 
non interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from the twelve months ended december  the increase in the contribution to the foundation  conversion and merger related charges  salaries and employee benefits and the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets were the primary causes for the increase in non interest expense for the year ended december  the contribution to the foundation was a one time event  as management does not expect to make future contributions to the foundation 
conversion and merger related charges included primarily legal  accounting and consulting assistance  and advertising expenses related to the integration of the acquired companies and rebranding the bank as newalliance bank 
excluding the one time event of the contribution to the foundation  salaries and employee benefits represented the largest increase in expenses during the year 
approximately  or million  of the million increase was directly attributable to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance 
the remaining  or million  increase was mainly a result of increased salaries and benefits due to increased staffing levels and restructuring of benefit plans as the bank converted from a mutual savings bank to a stock bank 
occupancy and furniture and fixtures expenses increased as we added branches to our network with the acquisitions 
management expects occupancy expense to decrease slightly in future periods as nine branches were consolidated in september and a tenth in december 
outside services increased million and were driven mainly by increases in data processing fees for the increased transactional volume and core system usage  and additional legal  accounting and consulting fees related to the additional responsibilities of being a newly formed public company 
the increase in advertising and public relations expense is due to an increase in marketing campaigns conducted and sponsorships granted throughout our expanded geographical area 
the million increase in amortization of identifiable intangible assets is directly attributable to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance and is primarily the amortization of non compete agreements and core deposit intangible assets 
other expenses increased million with approximately  or million  of the increase related to general operating costs for the branches added in the acquisitions 
the bulk of the remaining increase  approximately million  is due to increases in director and officer liability insurance coverage 
premiums for this coverage increased due to the bank s conversion to a public company  and the company increasing the level of its coverage

for the year ended december   the income tax expense of million resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  is primarily due to excess remuneration pursuant to internal revenue code m and to the increase in the valuation allowance required for the charitable contribution to the foundation 
the change in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  in comparison to the twelve months ended december  is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with bank owned life insurance and the dividend received deduction 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  financial condition summary from december  to december   total assets and liabilities increased approximately million and million  respectively  due mainly to increases in loans  investments and borrowings 
stockholders equity decreased million to billion due primarily to treasury shares acquired  dividends and a decrease in the after tax fair value of investment securities  partially offset by net income and stock issued to acquire trust company

table of contents as shown in table  gross loans were billion at december   up million from year end the increase in gross loan balances was primarily attributable to increases in residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit 
residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio as of december   comprising approximately of gross loans 
the increase in the balance of million since december  was due to loan portfolio originations and purchases  partially offset by a decrease in organic loan balances 
the purchased portfolio includes adjustable rate and and year fixed rate residential real estate loans with property locations predominately in the northeast 
for the year ended december   loan purchases accounted for million of new residential real estate loans 
the company plans to expand its geographical target area for residential real estate loan purchases to supplement the organic portfolio 
the company also continues to originate year fixed rate mortgages for sale  which amounted to million during the year 
home equity loans and lines of credit increased million from december  to december  these products were promoted by the company through attractive pricing and marketing campaigns as the company is committed to growing this loan segment while maintaining credit quality as a higher yielding alternative to investments 
commercial real estate loans increased million from december  to december  the increase was attributable to increases in both the number and average balance of loan originations as a result of the company s improved competitive position in the connecticut commercial real estate lending market subsequent to the acquisitions of connecticut bancshares and alliance 
the company s continued strategy is to have a larger percentage of the company s assets be attributable to commercial loans including real estate  construction and other commercial loans 
to accomplish this goal  the company is expanding penetration of its geographical target area as well as promoting stronger business development efforts to obtain new business banking relationships  while still maintaining credit quality

table of contents other real estate owned the company classifies property acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure as other real estate owned in its financial statements 
when a property is placed in other real estate owned  the excess of the loan balance over the estimated fair market value of the collateral  based on a recent appraisal  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
estimated fair value usually represents the sales price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions  including normal loan terms from other financial institutions  less the estimated costs to sell the property 
management inspects all other real estate owned properties periodically 
subsequent writedowns in the carrying value of other real estate owned are charged to expense if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
at december   the company had no other real estate owned 
classification of assets and loan review the chief credit officer is responsible for this evaluation process and is assisted by the use of an independent third party loan review company 
an internal risk rating system is used to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in its loan portfolio 
at the time of loan approval  all commercial and commercial real estate loans are assigned a risk rating based on all of the factors considered in originating the loan 
the initial risk rating is recommended by the loan officer who originated the loan and approved by the loan approval authority 
under our internal risk rating system  we currently classify problem and potential problem assets as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
in addition  assets which do not currently expose the company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention 
the company engages an independent third party to conduct semi annual loan reviews of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios  including a penetration of the commercial loan portfolio by dollar amount within a range of to 
the loan reviews provide a credit evaluation of individual loans to ensure the appropriateness of the risk rating classification 
in addition  there is an independent loan review of the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios through a quarterly review of a sampling of new loans closed during the period 
on a quarterly basis  a criticized asset committee composed of the chief credit officer  executive vice president of business banking and other senior officers meet to review criticized asset reports on commercial and commercial real estate loans that are risk rated special mention  substandard  or doubtful 
the reports focus on the current status  strategy  financial data  and appropriate risk rating of the criticized loan 
at december   loans classified as substandard both accruing and nonaccruing totaled million  and consisted of million in commercial real estate loans and million in commercial loans 
special mention loans totaled million  and consisted of million of commercial real estate loans and million of commercial loans 
there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  allowance for loan losses the board of directors and management of the company are committed to the establishment and maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses  determined in accordance with gaap 
our approach is to follow the most recent guidelines that have been provided by our regulators and the sec 
management believes that the methodology it employs to develop  monitor and support the allowance for loan losses is consistent with those guidelines 
while management believes that it has established adequate specific and general allowances for probable losses on loans  there can be no assurance that the regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request an increase in the allowance for losses  thereby negatively affecting the company s financial condition and earnings 
moreover  actual losses may be dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the allowance for loan losses may become necessary 
the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses based on management s on going evaluation of the risks inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans when it is determined that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses

management follows a guiding principle that the level of the allowance for loan losses should be directionally consistent with asset quality indicators 

table of contents the allowance is computed by segregating the portfolio into pools of loans that have similar loan product type and risk rating characteristics 
management uses historical default and loss rates  internal risk ratings  industry data  peer comparisons  and other risk based characteristics 
the data is then analyzed and estimates of losses inherent in the portfolio are determined using formula allowances for homogeneous pools of loans and criticized loans  and specific allowances for impaired loans 
the provision and allowance for loan losses are then reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors on a quarterly basis

this is an increase of million  or  from billion at december  the increase was primarily the result of purchases of mortgage backed securities 
the company s investment strategy has been to purchase hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  five and seven year balloon mortgage backed securities  ten year pass through mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations based off fifteen year mortgage collateral 
these securities have been emphasized due to their limited extension risk in a rising rate environment and for their monthly cash flows that provide the company with liquidity 
this strategy has been supplemented with select purchases of bullet and callable agency and asset backed securities 
for mortgage backed securities  the average life at purchase has ranged between and years and the maturity dates for agency obligations have ranged between one and five years 
the company is amortizing any premium paid on hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to the initial reset date due to management s experience with prepayments by the initial reset date 
sfas no 
requires the company to designate its securities as held to maturity  available for sale or trading depending on the company s intent regarding its investments at the time of purchase 
the company does not currently maintain a portfolio of trading securities 
as of december   billion  or of the portfolio  was classified as available for sale and million of the portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
the net unrealized loss on securities classified as available for sale as of december  was million compared to an unrealized loss of million as of december  the depreciation in the market value of securities available for sale was primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates during the period 
management has performed a review of all investments with unrealized losses and noted that none of these investments had other than temporary impairment 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the carrying value  weighted average yield and contractual maturities of the company s investment portfolio as of december  in the case of mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  the table shows the securities by their contractual maturities  however  there are scheduled principal payments and there will be unscheduled prepayments prior to their contractual maturity

in accordance with sfas no 
 the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their fair values on the acquisition date 
in connection with determining the fair market values  the company retained the services of third parties to provide fair value appraisals of the core deposit and customer list intangibles and to review the value of the non compete agreements 
the company also utilized third parties to compute the market value for loans  deposits and certain fixed assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis  over their estimated lives 
management assesses the recoverability of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if carrying amount exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded to income 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
for  the goodwill evaluation occurred in the first quarter and no impairment was recorded  and no events or circumstances subsequent to that evaluation indicate that the carrying value of the company s goodwill may not be recoverable 
other assets the company s other assets increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this net increase was primarily due to increases for a million cash prepayment for the cornerstone acquisition which closed on january   million increase in accrued interest receivable and a prepaid pension asset of million as a result of the company s cash contribution to its pension plan during which relieved the accrued pension liability recorded at december   offset by a decrease of million in the current federal income tax receivable 
deposits and borrowings the company s traditional sources of funds are the deposits it gathers  borrowings from the fhlb and customer repurchase agreements 
the company s fhlb borrowings are collateralized by stock in the fhlb  certain mortgage loans and other investments 
repayment and prepayment of loans and securities  proceeds from sales of loans and securities and proceeds from maturing securities are also sources of funds for the company

time and demand deposits increased by million and million  respectively  which resulted from the company s strategy of offering premium time deposit rates to customers who either have or establish a checking relationship with the company coupled with the offering of new free checking products to both retail and commercial customers 
money market accounts decreased million since december  as the company supplemented promotional offerings on money market accounts with promotional offerings on time deposits 
savings decreased million due in part to the market interest rate environment and promotionally driven migration to time deposits as a result of more favorable and rate sensitive pricing of these products

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future short term financial obligations 
the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the company s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments and sales  maturities  paydowns and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities  borrowings from the federal home loan bank and repurchase agreements 
the company has expanded its use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank to fund purchases of investments and residential mortgage loans while managing interest rate risk and liquidity 
at december   total borrowings from the federal home loan bank amounted to billion  exclusive of million in purchase accounting adjustments  and the company had the capacity to increase that total to billion 
additional borrowing capacity would be available by pledging eligible investment securities as collateral 
depending on market conditions and the company s liquidity and gap position  the company may continue to borrow from the federal home loan bank or initiate borrowings through the repurchase agreement market 
at december  the company s repurchase agreement lines of credit totaled million  million of which was available on that date 
the company determines its cash position daily 
the investment department compiles reports detailing the company s cash activity and cash balances occurring at its various correspondents and through its various funding sources 
the investment department then settles all correspondent and bank accounts either investing excess funds or borrowing to cover the projected shortfall 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investment activities during any given period 
at december   cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year amounted to million  or of total assets 
management believes that the cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities maturing within one year  coupled with the borrowing line at the federal home loan bank and the available repurchase agreement lines at selected broker dealers  provide for sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs 
at december   the company had commitments to originate loans  unused outstanding lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling million 
management anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
time deposits maturing within one year from december  amount to billion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market and interest rate risk general market risk is the exposure to losses resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has no foreign currency or commodity price risk 
credit risk related to investment securities is low as substantially all are investment grade or have government guarantees 
the chief market risk factor affecting financial condition and operating results is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
this risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given the company s capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net earnings to changes in interest rates 
the asset liability committee  comprised of several senior executives  is responsible for managing interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  the board of directors reviews the company s gap position and interest rate sensitivity exposure described below and asset liability committee minutes detailing the company s activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company s operating results  interest rate risk position and the effect changes in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income 
the extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings 
the principal strategies used to manage interest rate risk include i emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate loans  and origination of loans with maturities matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans  ii investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and or average lives and iii classifying a significant portion of its investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management 
the company employs two approaches to interest rate risk measurement  gap analysis and income simulation analysis 
gap analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is deemed to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the company s cumulative one year interest rate gap which is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was negative million  or negative of total assets 
the bank s approved policy limit is plus or minus 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest 
table of contents rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
the following table sets forth the company s cumulative maturity distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio  and cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities ratio 
this table indicates the time periods in which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
assumptions are made on the rate of prepayment of principal on loans and investment securities 
however  this table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest yield because the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the gap analysis 
as a result  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same time period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
it should also be noted that this table reflects certain assumptions regarding the categorization of assets and liabilities and represents a one day position  in fact  variations occur daily as management adjusts interest rate sensitivity throughout the year

tested scenarios include instantaneous rate shocks  rate ramps over a six month or one year period  static rates  non parallel shifts in the yield curve and a forward rate scenario 
the simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon  usually a three year period 
simulation analysis involves projecting future balance sheet structure and interest income and expense under the various rate scenarios 
the company s internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for all interest rate scenarios  the estimated net interest margin over the next months should decline by less than as compared to the forecasted net interest margin in the base case scenario 
however  in practice  interest rate risk is managed well within these guidelines 
for the base case rate scenario the forward yield curve as of december  was utilized 
this resulted in a yield curve that increased approximately basis points at the front end of the yield curve and increased approximately basis points at the long end of the yield curve 
the overnight rate was modeled to increase by bp 
this interest rate scenario most closely approximates management s expectations for interest rate movements over the next twelve months 

table of contents as of december   the company s estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest margin for the next twelve month period as compared to the forecasted net interest margin in the base case scenario are as follows percentage change in estimated net interest margin over twelve months basis point instantaneous and sustained increase in rates basis point instantaneous and sustained decrease in rates in the current rate environment  an instantaneous and sustained downward rate shock of basis points is a realistic representation of the potential risk facing the company due to declining rates 
for an increase in rates  a basis points instantaneous and sustained rate shock is also a relevant representation of potential risk given the current rate structure and the current state of the economy 
based on the scenarios above  net interest income would be adversely affected in the month period after an immediate decrease in rates  and would increase slightly after an immediate increase in rates 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the degree to which non maturity deposits react to changes in market rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on time deposits and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
