index to financial statements background cpsi was founded in and specializes in delivering comprehensive healthcare information systems and related services to community hospitals 
our systems and services are designed to support the primary functional areas of a hospital and to enhance access to needed financial and clinical information 
our comprehensive system enables healthcare providers to improve clinical  financial and administrative outcomes 
our products and services provide solutions in key areas  including patient management  financial management  patient care and clinical  enterprise and office automation 
in addition to servicing small to medium sized hospitals  we provide information technology services to other related entities in the healthcare industry  such as nursing homes  home health agencies and physician clinics 
we sell a fully integrated  enterprise wide financial and clinical hospital information system comprised of all necessary software  hardware  peripherals  forms and office supplies  together with comprehensive customer service and support 
we also offer outsourcing services  including electronic billing submissions  patient statement processing and business office functions  as part of our overall information system solution 
we believe that as our customer base grows  the demand for our outsourcing services will also continue to grow  supporting further increases in recurring revenues 
our system currently is installed and operating in over hospitals in states and the district of columbia 
our customers consist of community hospitals with or fewer acute care beds  with hospitals having or fewer acute care beds comprising approximately of our customers 
overview we have achieved a compounded annual growth rate in revenues and net income of approximately and  respectively  over the past five years 
we experienced a steady improvement in revenues and net income during each quarter of and our net income margin progressively increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of we added new hospital clients in  with the size of our average installation contract increasing from approximately  in to approximately  in our gross revenues increased over  while our net income increased  principally as a result of the improved financial condition of community hospitals during much of cash flow from operations and total cash collections increased in and reached record levels of million and million  respectively 
we continue to believe that our strong cash performance reflects both the quality of our customer service and our product offerings 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of medicare act  community hospitals began experiencing improved medicare reimbursement starting in april  the month in which the medicare act became effective 
in the past  medicare s payment formula had created a disproportionate burden on smaller  community based hospitals  which also typically depend on medicare for a greater share of their payer mix than larger  urban facilities 
the medicare act rectifies some of this imbalance  raising medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals by an estimated billion over the next ten years 
we believe this legislation will remove one of the primary obstacles to community hospitals investing in healthcare information technology 
many of these hospitals had postponed or substantially limited such investments prior to the effectiveness of the medicare act 
accordingly  we believe that the financial effects of this legislation on community hospitals will have a positive impact on our financial results and will put us in a good position to continue to grow our business 
our improving results throughout and support the confidence we have in our business  our target market and the quality of the products and services we offer
