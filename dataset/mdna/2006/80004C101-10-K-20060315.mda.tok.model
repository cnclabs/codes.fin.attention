our flash data storage devices are marketed and sold primarily in the consumer electronics market 
we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash cards  consumers will demand an increasing number of megabytes of memory 
in order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity in the market for flash data storage cards  we must reduce our cost per megabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per megabyte to the consumer 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including  among others  the unit volume of product sales  the flash memory density of the products sold  competitive pricing pressures  availability of foundry capacity from both captive and non captive sources  the timing and volume of sell through by our distributors and retail customers to their customers  variations in manufacturing cycle times  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing capacity utilization  the timing of significant orders  our ability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient supply  changes in product and customer mix  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  the timing of license and royalty revenues  fluctuations in product costs  increased research and development expenses and exchange rate fluctuations 
see item a  risk factors 
we operate in one business segment  flash memory products 
our chief decision maker  our president and chief executive officer  evaluates our performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and by product category 
memory sourcing 
nand memory is the largest component of the cost of our products 
the majority of our nand memory is purchased from captive sources of supply and our ventures with toshiba and our toshiba foundry arrangement 
we also purchase flash memory products from non captive sources  to supplement our captive supply  allowing us to flexibly capture more market share 
this non captive supply enabled us to generate additional sales and profits even though the gross margin on our non captive supply is significantly lower than the gross margin on our captive supply 
however  our captive supply requires us to invest in capital assets  research and development and start up and other production costs 
we expect to continue sourcing both captive and non captive flash memory 

table of contents licensing and royalties 
the timing and amount of royalty revenues and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of our license agreements and the timing and volume of sales of products by our licensees 
gross margins and operating income fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues since license and royalty revenues have immaterial variable costs of sale 
retail sales 
our arrangements with retailers often involve complex terms 
these terms include providing the retailer with a right to return unsold product  market development funds  cooperative advertising funds  price protection  volume incentive rebates and other promotions 
in some cases  we consign inventory to our customers 
these consignment activities involve administrative costs to track and account for our inventory 
we defer recognition of revenue on sales to retailers and distributors until they sell through the product they have purchased from us to their customers 
our retail business is seasonal  with the fourth quarter being the strongest due to holiday sales in north america 
memory market dynamics 
semiconductor memory markets have generally been characterized by cycles of undersupply and oversupply 
in an oversupply environment  price reductions occur and the value of our inventory may decrease resulting in a lower of cost or market price adjustment if pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost 
in  for example  we recorded approximately million of charges related to inventory revaluation 
we may be forced to reduce the carrying value of our inventory if market demand for our products deteriorates and our inventory levels exceed customer orders 
our business is characterized by constant focus on cost reduction 
nand flash memory cost reduction is achieved by transitioning to new generations of technology  by producing larger wafer sizes and by improving yields 
manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation 
during the start up phase  the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers  making this output very expensive 
in the next two to three years  we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity in the ventures with toshiba 
matrix acquisition 
on january   we acquired matrix semiconductor  inc matrix is a pioneer in the design and development of three dimensional d integrated circuits 
matrix d memory is used for one time programmable storage applications where low cost is the paramount consideration  such as video games  music and archiving 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  among others  those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories and related reserves  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates have historically approximated actual results 
however  future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at january  and january   deferred income  from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings  including price protection  promotions  co op advertising  and other volume based incentives and expected returns 
additionally  we have incentive programs that require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
all sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues  deferred revenues or a charge to marketing expenses 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not been significantly different from our estimates 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates  which could impact the net revenue we report 
inventories and inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six to twelve months 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than our product on hand and our noncancelable orders  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
accounting for investments 
we evaluate whether entities that we have invested in are variable interest entities within the definition of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for variable interest entities 
if those entities are variable interest entities  then we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to residual gains and residual losses on liquidation of that entity 
with respect to all equity investments  we review the degree of control that our investment and other arrangements give us over the entity we have invested in and our business to confirm that these conclusions are correct 
generally  after considering all factors  if we hold equity interests representing less than of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in  we use the cost method of accounting 
if we hold at least but less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of an entity we invested in  we use the equity method of accounting 
we have the financial capability and the intent to hold our loans to the ventures with toshiba until maturity and accordingly those loans are carried at cost and their value in our financial statements is not adjusted to market value 
deferred tax assets 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we carried a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of million and million at january  and january   respectively  based on our view that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to take tax a benefit for unrealized capital losses on our investments in foundries

fiscal gross margins were also benefited due to more production supply coming from captive sources which have lower costs 
the largest driver of the decline in product gross margins was an increased reliance on non captive memory sources 
we earn significantly lower gross margins on non captive memory than on captive memory supply  and non captive memory accounted for approximately and of our memory sourcing in and  respectively 
our captive gross margin improved by approximately two percentage points as our cost reductions were greater than the decline in average selling price per megabyte 
this partially offset the impact of our higher non captive mix

we also expect to spend approximately million on property and equipment  which includes assembly and test equipment as well as engineering equipment  and spending related to facilities and information systems 
long term requirements 
depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future 
we may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions 
these additional investments may require us to raise additional financing

contingent obligations 
we agreed to reimburse toshiba for of losses it sustains under its guarantee of flashvision s operating lease with mizuho leasing 
as of january   the maximum exposure for both us and toshiba under that guarantee was billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january   and our maximum exposure was billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january  see item  business ventures with toshiba flashvision 
toshiba ventures 
we are a percent owner in two ventures  flashvision and flash partners 
toshiba owns of each of these ventures 
we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate 
flashvision and flash partners are variable interest entities and we are not the primary beneficiary of either venture because we are entitled to less than a majority of any residual gains and are obligated with respect to less than a majority of residual losses with respect to both ventures 
both flashvision and flash partners purchase wafers from toshiba and then resell those wafers to toshiba and us at cost plus a markup 
the cost of the wafers we purchase from flashvision and flash partners is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of sales 
our share of the net income or loss of flashvision and flash partners is included in our consolidated statement of income as equity in income loss of business ventures 
flashvision and flash partners each own or lease separately semiconductor manufacturing equipment that is placed inside toshiba s yokkaichi  japan operations 
the capital equipment owned by flashvision and flash partners is funded through investments in or loans to the ventures from us and toshiba 
for semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by flashvision or flash partners  we guarantee a portion of the outstanding lease payments under those leases through various methods 
this obligation is denominated in japanese yen and is noncancelable 
we are contractually obligated to purchase half of flashvision and flash partners nand wafer supply 
the cost of the wafer supply includes all amounts to reimburse flashvision and flash partners for their costs to produce the nand wafers 
we cannot estimate the total amount of the wafer purchase commitment as of january  because our price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the semiconductor wafers 
in addition to the semiconductor assets owned by flashvision and flash partners  we purchase and directly own semiconductor manufacturing equipment in toshiba s yokkaichi operations for which we receive of the output from this equipment 
from time to time  we and toshiba mutually approve increases in wafer supply capacity of flashvision and flash partners that may contractually obligate us to increased capital funding 
we and toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
as part of the flashvision and flash partners agreements  we agreed to share in toshiba s costs associated with nand product development and its common semiconductor research and development activities 
as of january   we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of million 
our common research and development obligation related to flashvision and flash partners is variable but capped at increasing fixed quarterly amounts through and is not subject to any payment caps thereafter 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
our direct research and development contribution is determined based on a variable computation 
the common r d participation agreement and the product development agreement are exhibits to this report and should be read carefully in their entirety for a more complete understanding of these arrangements 
we have guaranteed on an unsecured and several basis of flash partners lease obligation under a master lease agreement entered into in december our total lease obligation guarantee  net of lease payments as of january   was billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january  in december  flash partners secured an additional equipment lease facility of billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january   from a consortium of financial institutions 
we agreed to guarantee on an unsecured and several basis of the draw downs under this facility 
as of january   no draw downs had been made  however the entire amount was drawn down in january our maximum exposure under the guarantee is billion japanese yen  or approximately 
table of contents million based upon the exchange rate at january  see item  business ventures with toshiba flash partners 
the terms of the flash partners venture contractually obligate us and toshiba to expand flash partners capacity 
as of february  we and toshiba have committed to expand flash partners capacity to  wafer starts per month 
we currently estimate the remaining total equipment funding obligation for the  wafer starts per month level to be approximately billion japanese yen  or approximately billion based upon the exchange rate at january  of this amount  we are obligated to fund billion japanese yen  or approximately billion based upon the exchange rate at january   of which billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january   is being financed through flash partners operating lease facilities 
our remaining funding obligation at january  is approximately billion

impact of currency exchange rates future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and result of operations 
in  we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies than the us dollar  currently only the japanese yen 
we did not use foreign currency forward contracts in and we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense

impact of recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  adopted a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or fas r  share based payments  with an effective date of june  in april  the sec amended the effective date of fas r  and we will now be required to adopt this standard for our first fiscal year beginning after june  we adopted fas r in january and currently do not expect to restate prior periods to conform to the new accounting standard as we will use the modified prospective method 
fas r requires us to recognize an expense based on the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including grants of options to buy shares of our common stock 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information related to the pro forma effect on reported net income and net earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of the fas adoption of fas r is expected to increase our operating expenses 
in anticipation of expensing equity instruments  we have reduced overall stock option grants and reduced the percentage of incentive stock options to total stock options granted 
in may  the fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  accounting changes and error corrections 
fas replaced accounting pronouncement board opinion no 
 or apb  accounting changes  and financial accounting standards no 
 or fas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
fas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all 
table of contents prior period financial statements presented based on the application of the new accounting principle 
the statement will require the retrospective application of the impact of the direct effect of changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
fas carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and changes in accounting estimates 
fas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and require prospective application 
we will adopt this standard on january  and currently do not anticipate that it will have a material effect on its financial statements or disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
as of january   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
movements in currency exchange rates  especially the japanese yen  could cause variability in our revenues  expenses or other income expense  net 
we had forward exchange contracts in place with a notional amount of billion japanese yen  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at january  and zero as of january  the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate million loss 
however  as we utilize foreign currency instruments  for mitigating anticipated balance sheet exposures  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see item a  risk factors 
and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
as of january   a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at january  actual results may differ materially
