item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations monetary amounts presented in the following discussion are in thousands  except per share amounts 
overview this overview is intended to provide a context for the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
we have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short term and long term opportunities  challenges and risks including material trends and uncertainties which we face 
we also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities  challenges and risks 
the overview is not intended as a summary of  or a substitute for review of  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for comparative purposes  certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the reclassifications had no impact on net income 
business segments we operate as a rural local telephone company providing integrated communications services to residential and business customers in markets throughout the eastern half of pennsylvania 
we operate an incumbent rural local exchange carrier  or rlec  in parts of berks  lancaster  union and smaller portions of five other adjacent counties in pennsylvania  and a competitive local exchange carrier  or clec  in the lancaster  harrisburg  reading  altoona  pottstown  state college and williamsport  pennsylvania metropolitan areas  which we refer to as our edge out markets 
we offer our customers a comprehensive package of communications services including local and long distance telephone services  broadband services  internet access and  in certain of our markets  video services 
we also provide business customers with integrated voice and data network solutions 
our segments are rlec  clec  internet services  and systems integration 
the measure of profitability that management uses to evaluate performance of our business segments is operating income loss because individual segments are not charged an allocation for such items as interest and income taxes that are reported below operating income on the statement of operations 
as of december   we served  rlec access lines   clec access lines   digital subscriber lines dsl   dial up internet access subscribers   video subscribers and web hosting customers 
for the year ended december   we generated total revenues of million  operating income of million and net income of million 
historically  we have derived a majority of our revenues and substantially all of our operating income from the regulated rlec segment 
our rlec revenue is derived primarily from local telephone service  network access charges  enhanced telephone services  directory and regional toll service 
our clec focuses primarily on businesses  and revenue is derived primarily from local telephone service  network access charges  enhanced telephone services and long distance service revenue 
our internet services revenue is derived from broadband and dial up internet access services  in addition to web hosting services and our new voice over internet protocol voip service 
our systems integration revenue is derived from sales of services and equipment that support the design  implementation and maintenance of local and wide area networks and telecommunications systems 
our operating costs and expenses primarily include wages and related employee benefit costs  depreciation and amortization  selling and advertising  software and information system services and general and administrative expenses 
our rlec segment incurs costs related to network access charges  directory expense  and other operations expenses such as digital electronic switch expense  engineering and outside plant costs 
our clec incurs costs related to leased network facilities associated with providing local telephone service to 
table of contents customers  engineering costs  and network access costs for local calls and long distance expense 
our internet services segment incurs leased network facilities costs for our dial up internet service and for our dsl broadband service 
our systems integration business incurs expenses primarily related to wages and employee benefit costs  and equipment and materials used in the course of the installation and provision of our products and services 
we incur access line related capital expenditures associated with access line additions  expenditures for upgrading existing facilities to provide broadband services and costs related to the provision of dsl internet services in our rlec and clec territories 
our capital expenditures related to clec access line growth are generally associated with serving additional customers or servicing existing customers on our own facilities and  therefore  tend to result in incremental revenue or higher margins from those customers 
we believe that our additional capital expenditures relating to our investment in software and systems will allow us to remain competitive in the marketplace and generally allow for corresponding reductions in operating expenses 
business strategy our primary business objective is to be a leading  regional integrated communications service provider icp 
to achieve this objective  we will continue to pursue the following goals we will pursue the goal of capturing as many broadband connections to customers homes and businesses as possible 
while we intend to continue to serve our dial up internet access customer base  our focus will be to migrate these customers in the rlec and clec areas to broadband connections 
new broadband customers will also be aggressively pursued 
targeting customers with a broadband connection to their home and or business is vital for the future delivery of internet protocol ip services 
we will continue to build out our fiber to the node infrastructure to support the future deployment of advanced broadband ip communication services 
we expect that the demands of our residential and business customers for increased bandwidth and ip applications will continue to grow 
we will continue to operate under a disciplined strategy to increase our market share in our edge out markets  primarily to business customers  by offering competitive communication service packages 
we will continue to leverage our modern network infrastructure  established reputation  extensive local knowledge and significant operating experience to attempt to gain new customers and increase our market share in our edge out markets 
our focus will be on acquiring customers that can be served from our own network facilities and moving existing customers from leased facilities to our own network 
we will pursue the goal of delivering excellence for our customers by providing reliable  responsive  state of the art broadband communications services  including voice  high speed data  voip and  in certain of our rlec and clec markets  video 
we will assess and tailor the bundling of services to best serve our customers and endeavor to achieve a competitive advantage in our local markets 
we have direct experience with video deployments on two technology platforms hybrid fiber coaxial in the state college clec market and adsl over the rlec copper system in union county  pennsylvania 
the potential roll out of video in our other rlecs is under review and evaluation 
we will endeavor to be a single source provider of voice and data communications services to our business customers 
we believe that the convergence and complexity of voice communications and data network technologies has increased the need for businesses to seek a single provider for all of their communications and data networking needs 
in  we will be creating a more direct link between our rlec  clec and internet customer base and the systems integration business through joint sales proposals  sales incentive plans  and needs based proposals that combine systems integration and rlec  clec or internet services for a custom and differentiated offering 
we will continue to make our commitment to customer service a top priority 
our noc provides monitoring  repair and emergency services hours a day  days a week and days a year  which 
table of contents strengthens our relationships with our customers and enhances our competitive position 
in an effort to speed up and enhance the customers experience when they call in service issues  we implemented a new case management system into the noc 
the system has given us the ability to better manage and prioritize service calls resulting in greater ability to manage the customer s request 
to further enable this  several automated tests were developed and implemented that allow us to analyze every issue that is called in  and within minutes  determine the location of the issue and identify and dispatch the appropriate technician 
our complement of managed services is used for internal monitoring within the customer s enterprise  external monitoring devices visible outside the customer s enterprise and comprehensive security assessments and management 
our managed services fills the needs of our customers by allowing them to improve reliability  provide higher levels of service and save money through efficient device management and planning 
we will offer a broad array of advanced communication services that will enable new modes of communication to become a part of the daily home or business experience 
a unified communications strategy will provide integrated applications eg email  voice mail  instant messaging and video conferencing to provide customers with greater flexibility to select their preferred method of communication 
critical developments in the communications industry one of the critical drivers in the communications industry today is the convergence of voice and data communication technologies into various ip based platforms  all of which have the potential to provide voip  broadband services  and ip video over telephone companies copper and fiber networks  cable companies coaxial and fiber networks  wireless telephone companies wireless networks  satellite companies satellite networks and electric companies electric lines 
although each of the networks has relative strengths and weaknesses  they are all effectively in competition for the customers communications needs 
these developments mean that we are competing for our existing customer base in our rlec and clec territories with cable tv companies  wireless telephone companies  satellite communications providers and voip providers 
the recent decreases in the number of access lines in our rlec territories reflect  in part  such increased competition  in addition to the elimination of lines by our customers as they shift to dsl for high speed internet access 
we have competitive strengths and weaknesses in the competition for the customer s communications dollar 
on a national basis  cable tv companies have the major market share of paid video services and have a larger market share of broadband internet access services  than telephone companies 
cable tv companies are now delivering voip services with systems fully capable of providing ip telephony services 
we are now offering video over a portion of our fiber copper network in the area of lewisburg  pennsylvania in competition with the video services offered by incumbent cable companies 
cable tv companies are typically subject to far less regulation in the provision of voice telephone services than are local telephone companies 
there is limited regulation of voip offerings at this time  placing voip at a possible regulatory advantage over traditional telephone services 
to date  voip is not regulated as a voice public utility service  except to the extent that the federal communications commission fcc has recently ordered that voip providers must enable their customers to access services 
to maintain and grow our voice communication business  we are introducing voip offerings into our marketplace 
the convergence of voice and data networks enables the deployment of voip services 
as an internet service provider isp  our provision of voip services is not geographically limited 
we have the potential to offer and provide our voip services anywhere to anyone who has a broadband connection  either through a dsl or cable modem connection 
the deployment of voip services minimizes the amount of additional infrastructure costs required to offer next generation voice services outside of our traditional service territories 
our voip initiatives may drive converged services and networks to produce operational efficiencies in addition to benefiting from the current minimal regulation to which it is subject 
other voip providers can offer voip services within our territory from any point outside of our territory that has internet access  subject to the requirement of also providing service 
if 
table of contents they qualify as a clec in our rlec territories  voip providers also might be eligible for number portability 
number portability would make it possible for our customers to switch to the voip services of another provider without changing telephone numbers 
the delivery systems of local telephone companies and cable tv companies are structured differently 
telephone systems are structured to foster two way conversations by providing separate lines to each customer 
this structure enables telephone systems  as they are upgraded to provide dsl and even video services  to transmit with similar capacities to and from customers premises without the system slowing down or failing in times of high traffic 
cable tv systems were originally structured to carry traffic one way to the customer and  although the systems are being upgraded to carry two way traffic  cable tv systems are not structured as well as telephone systems to carry two way traffic with the result that  in times of peak demand  cable tv systems may slow down or even fail to transmit their cable internet traffic 
this fundamental difference in the structure of telephone and cable systems can give telephone companies an advantage in providing dsl and iptv services  as both are highly interactive systems requiring fast transmittals in both directions 
according to widely published sources of business information  nationally  the growth rate of dsl subscribers has recently been outpacing the growth rate of cable modem subscribers  although cable is still ahead in terms of total subscribers 
we have been quite successful in marketing our dsl internet service to new subscribers  with the number of subscribers increasing from  as of december  to  as of december   a increase 
during the same period  the number of our rlec access lines decreased by from  as of december  to  as of december  we are also in competition with providers of wireless telephone and data services for the local telephone and data customer 
wireless telephone service providers have impacted our number of rlec access lines as customers use wireless for a second line and even substitute wireless entirely for wireline service 
we believe that wireline telephone and broadband transmissions still have significant advantages over wireless services in terms of rapid data rates and service accessibility and reliability 
our broadband emphasis through the expansion of our fiber to the node deployment  prepares us for accommodating the continuing demands of increased bandwidth for both consumers and businesses 
however  the access and mobility provided by wireless technologies creates tremendous value as the communications industry seeks to provide a seamless integration between wireline and wireless networks 
we are evaluating the capacity to provide local wireless data services  through wi fi  wimax and mhz technologies  in order to provide full broadband coverage to our customers 
the competitive threat posed by the convergence of technologies makes our commitment to customer service even more critical to the protection of our competitive position 
we are a local company with local connections that can give individual  personalized service 
we are also small enough to be able to provide an individual response to customer services needs 
we feel that this responsiveness will be critical to our ability to successfully convince both our business and residential customers to see us as their preferred provider of integrated communications services  particularly in light of the substantially greater resources of many of our competitors 
in order to remain competitive and provide the broadband services required for high speed data and video  we must continue to invest substantial amounts in our infrastructure 
we have installed significant amounts of fiber in our system 
we have even been installing ducts into new houses and businesses over the last years to enhance our ability to install fiber 
we have installed gigabit networks  and believe that we have the expertise to lead the way to providing ubiquitous broadband access in our markets 
we have completed of our requirements under act of the pennsylvania public utility code to provide broadband availability in of our rlec system by december  in keeping with the foregoing  our capital budget is approximately million 
however  as discussed more fully under the business risks section  our ability to invest in infrastructure to remain competitive may be limited by our indebtedness of approximately million as of december  
table of contents business risks our primary business risks include the external threats of increased competition  the complex and uncertain regulatory environment in the telecommunications industry and the internal risk of our debt financing 
risk of increased competition as described under the heading critical developments in the communications industry  the convergence of voice and data communication technologies has brought telephone companies into direct competition with cable tv companies  wireless telephone companies  voip providers and satellite companies 
the development of voip has enabled cable tv companies to provide telephone service in competition with us 
these developments have placed our core telephone business at risk  although also enabling us to compete in the provision of cable tv services 
it is basic policy of the fcc and the pennsylvania public utility commission puc to encourage competition in the communications industry 
the limited suspension that we held until january from certain interconnection requirements of the telecommunications act of has been discontinued  although legislation enacted in pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of provided a continued limited suspension to our buffalo valley rlec through december  these developments mean that two of our rlecs could be required to allow competitors to have access to our customers by our competitors seeking the removal of our rural exemption  entering our territory and using our facilities through interconnection agreements to provide local services 
local cable tv companies may use their own facilities and apply to be licensed as a facilities based clec within our franchise territory in order to attempt to qualify for number portability 
this would enable our existing telephone customers to switch to voip services provided by the cable tv companies and still retain the same telephone numbers  thus making the transfer of local telephone services to voip far more convenient to the customer 
service electric telephone company  llc  filed on september  with the puc to be a facilities based clec competitor in our conestoga rlec territory 
in addition  core communications  inc core filed an amended application on august  with the puc to be a facilities based clec providing service in our rlec territories 
on january   core served our three rlecs with their petition for arbitration 
included in appendix of their filing is a request seeking a termination of the rural exemption for the limited purpose of permitting the interconnection standards to apply to any direct interconnection between our three rlecs and core 
we are actively engaged in these filings and will be working with both clecs to develop interconnection agreements to be filed with the puc 
in areas served by our clec  the incumbent carrier  verizon  enjoys certain business advantages  including its size  financial resources  brand recognition and network connection to virtually all of our customers and potential customers in those areas 
similarly  in areas where we do or may provide video services  the incumbent cable operators enjoy certain business advantages  including their size  financial resources  brand recognition  and ownership of or superior access to programming 
we are subject to a complex and uncertain regulatory environment that may require us to alter our business plans and face increased competition 
the united states communications industry is subject to federal  state and local regulations that are continually evolving 
as new communications laws and regulations are issued  we may be required to modify our business plans or operations  and we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner 
federal and state regulatory trends toward a more competitive marketplace through reduced competitive entry standards are likely to have negative effects on our business and our ability to compete 
in this regard  the regulatory environment governing incumbent local exchange carrier ilec operations has been and will likely continue to be very liberal in its approach to promoting competition and network access  which may increase the likelihood of new competitors offering similar services in our service areas 
the introduction of new competitors could have a negative effect on our rlec operating results yet at the same time present operating benefits to our clec business 

table of contents prices for rlec s interstate services  consisting primarily of subscriber line charges and access charges for interstate and international toll calls  are regulated by the fcc based on the average schedule formulas proposed by national exchange carrier association neca 
removal of the rlecs from the neca average schedule formulas could result in a significant revenue loss 
changes in the average schedule formula amounts developed by neca and implemented annually in july could have a negative effect on the rlec s future revenues 
neca filed their annual updated formulas with the fcc to be effective july  this update proposes major reductions to settlements received by larger rlecs  including our three rlecs 
it also proposed a two year transition for implementing the new calculations 
based on our evaluation we estimate the impact  excluding any transition period  would be approximately a million reduction in network access revenues for the six month period beginning july   or an annual decrease of million 
it is estimated that approval of the proposed transition plan to phase in new settlement calculations over a longer period could reduce the impact by as much as to 
the fcc has requested comment from interested parties on neca s filing 
we will not know until june whether the fcc accepts the revised calculations of neca or whether the fcc will accept the two year transition of the reduced settlement amounts 
the puc is currently considering changes in intrastate switched access rates and universal service funding usf reform for independent local exchange carriers in pennsylvania 
the proceeding  which began in december  addresses the rates that our rlecs charge to long distance carriers for intrastate toll calls that originate or terminate on our rlecs local telephone lines 
our rlecs also receive funding from the pennsylvania usf  which could be affected by the puc s investigation 
at this time  we cannot predict either the timing or the outcome of the puc s proceeding 
on february   the fcc initiated a proceeding to develop a unified intercarrier compensation regime 
this proceeding will likely affect our rlecs  clecs  long distance and voip operations 
the fcc is considering various plans that have been submitted to the fcc and has solicited comments from the public concerning those proposals 
most  if not all of these proposals  if adopted  would affect the intercarrier compensation revenues and expenses as well as the usf funding that our rlecs receive 
the rule changes that result from this proceeding could have a material effect on our revenues  expenses and earnings 
until the fcc adopts a specific proposal  it is impossible to predict how changes will affect our company 
risk of debt financing we had indebtedness of approximately million at december  we refinanced our indebtedness in march and further amended our credit facility in november the effect of the refinancing was to lower the interest rates on our indebtedness  provide greater flexibility in our financial covenants and spread out the amortization of principal 
the refinancing also lifted restrictions on the expansion of our clec edge out market and eliminated the requirement of the prior loan agreement that excess cash flow be applied to prepayments of principal 
this new structure  pursued to manage our balance sheet in order to better achieve our business plan  decreases the risks associated with our indebtedness 
however  our indebtedness could still restrict our operations because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
certain covenants in our loan agreement limit the amount of capital investment 
the level of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns  and our debt service obligations increase our vulnerability to competitive pressures  as we may be more leveraged than many of our competitors 
the foregoing opportunities and risks require management to attempt to balance several aspects of our business 
our rlec business segment provides cash flow both to pursue our business plan to be a leading  
table of contents regional broadband icp and to provide a current return on investment to our shareholders in the form of a dividend 
however  because our resources are limited  and the manner in which the communications industry will develop is uncertain  both in terms of technology and competition  we may not be able to pursue every possible avenue of development  and critical decisions will need to be made at various stages of our evolution as a company 
these decisions can be made more difficult by our desire to balance our short term goals of maintaining our rlec business segment and dividend return and our long term goal of providing voice  data and video services on the next generation  ip based network 
maintaining our dividend payout may be challenging due to the capital requirements of our business strategy  payments of principal and interest on our long term debt and restrictions under our financing facilities  both in the form of an annual limitation of million in dividends and the requirement to remain in compliance with financial covenants 
results of operations the measure of segment results used by management is operating income loss 
certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation

long distance revenues decreased and revenue from inter segment billing and collection services was down since november  expenses for preparation of customer billing are charged directly to each segment 
prior to the november billing conversion  certain expenses were recorded in one segment and then recorded as inter segment billing and collection revenue 
in  local telephone service revenues increased and network access revenues decreased by similar amounts as part of a rate rebalancing in july dedicated data circuits and leased facilities grew in  increasing both local telephone service and network access revenues 
access revenues decreased due to the net effect of a revision to our neca settlements estimate  increased wireless minutes of use resulting in approximately additional revenue  and a new reciprocal compensation agreement with a wireless carrier which decreased revenue approximately  other revenue decreased as a result of reductions in long distance revenues and premise hardware and services revenues more than offsetting the increase in directory revenue 
rlec segment operating expenses decreased  or to  in and increased  or  to  in in  decreases included  for contracted billing services   in depreciation due to changes in the estimated lives of various fixed asset categories  in network access expenses  in maintenance contracts and  in corporate overhead expenses as a result of our other business segments receiving a larger share of the allocation of corporate overhead expenses  which are allocated to each segment based on the average of segment revenues  expenses and certain balance sheet amounts 
these decreases more than offset a increase in the cost of employee benefits 
in  directory expense increased in line with directory revenues 
operating expenses increased due to the cost of complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act relating to internal controls over financial reporting which was primarily allocated to the rlec segment 
operating income increased  or  in to  and decreased  or  in to  
table of contents local telephone revenues are anticipated to continue to decline as the result of continuing access line losses due to increasing competition from wireless and cable providers offering alternative services  including voip 
network access revenues are projected to decrease due to declining minutes of use and less favorable neca settlements for average schedule companies 
neca filed their annual updated formulas with the fcc to be effective july  this update proposes major reductions to settlements received by larger rlecs  including our three rlecs 
it also proposed a two year transition for implementing the new calculations

we will not know until june whether the fcc accepts the revised calculations of neca or whether the fcc will accept the two year transition of the reduced settlement amounts 
other revenues  which include enhanced services voice mail  custom calling features and other miscellaneous services  are likely to continue the trend of moderate increases 
at the same time  we expect continued decreases in long distance service revenues 
clec segment results summary operating results clec segment revenues local telephone service network access long distance other total revenues depreciation and amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses operating loss operating loss of revenues access lines at december clec segment revenues increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in the increase was related to the increase in access lines and growth in the number of dedicated data circuits  which increased local telephone service and network access revenues approximately  state access revenue increased from higher minutes of use 
long distance revenues decreased approximately  due to a decline in the average rate per minute of use and the loss of one significant customer 
the increase was related to the addition of access lines for new customers and growth in dedicated data circuits  which increased both local telephone service and network access revenues 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in long distance revenues due to rate reductions and decreased minutes of use 
clec segment operating expenses increased  or  to  in and  or to  in in  wages increased and benefits increased as a result of our need to support a larger customer base and increased pension costs 
depreciation increased from asset additions and decreases in estimated lives of certain assets 
the cost of services increased  related to providing more leased facilities required by customer growth 
network access expenses decreased  as a result of savings achieved from the implementation of a new agreement to provide a least cost routing service for completion of long distance calls and partially from the loss of one significant customer 
customer billing expenses decreased 
table of contents resulting from completion of the billing conversion during the fourth quarter of gross receipts taxes increased approximately due to a true up of the prior year tax return 
corporate overhead expenses  which are allocated to each segment based on the average of segment revenues  expenses and certain balance sheet amounts  increased as a result of a higher allocation than in the prior year 
the increase in was primarily related to increases in the cost of leased facilities  wages and benefits  and depreciation  offset by a decrease in long distance costs and a reduction in subscriber billing costs 
operating losses decreased  or  to  in and  or  in to  primarily due to changes in operating efficiencies and moving more customers to our own network 
local telephone service revenues are projected to grow moderately as additional access lines are placed in service in existing markets 
our strategy to place more lines  both new and existing  on our own network is expected to increase the operating margin of those lines by eliminating the need for leasing facilities from other local exchange carriers to provide service for those lines 
long distance revenues are expected to decrease due to increased competition and tighter margins  as competitors such as wireless carriers and voip providers continue to offer unlimited minute pricing 
internet services segment results summary operating results internet services segment revenues depreciation and amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses operating income loss operating income loss of revenues customers at december dsl dial up access web hosting services internet services segment revenues increased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in the increase resulted from additional dsl customers and included approximately of dsl revenue recorded as clec revenue in the previous year  prior to the wholesale arrangement effective january  revenue per dsl customer declined as a result of temporary promotional rates for new customers and the introduction of lower priced levels of dsl service 
the decrease in the number of dial up subscribers resulted in a decrease in dial up revenue 
the revenue increase in resulted from a increase in dsl customers  partially offset by a decrease of in the number of dial up internet customers  some of whom switched to dsl 
internet services segment operating expenses increased  or  to  in and  or to  in in  wages and benefits increased resulting from of additional costs for supporting a larger number of subscribers and related to the initiation of our new voip phone service 
other expenses incurred to initiate voip service totaled approximately the cost of services increased  as a result of increased customers and a broadband capacity upgrade implemented to accommodate expected continued dsl subscriber growth 
depreciation increased as a result of more assets being employed and corporate overhead expenses also increased as a result of a higher percentage allocation of corporate overhead expense than in the prior year 
in  direct cost of operations and increased depreciation made up most of the increased costs 
labor and benefits  to a large extent for expanded customer services  
table of contents accounted for over of the increased costs 
the operating loss was compared to an operating income of in the decrease in operating income in resulted primarily from the initiation of voip service  a higher percentage allocation of corporate overhead expenses and a decrease in the revenue per dsl customer 
growth in providing broadband services is projected to increase in the next several years  as customer demand for greater speed and bandwidth continues 
we expect continued growth in dsl customers  while the demand for dial up access is decreasing rapidly 
a consumer voip product was recently introduced with unlimited long distance at a competitively priced flat monthly fee 
although continuing investments must be made for equipment and infrastructure  we expect this segment to show positive operating income in the near future 
systems integration segment results summary operating results systems integration segment revenues depreciation and amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses operating loss operating loss of revenues systems integration segment revenues decreased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in the decrease consisted of  in communication services revenue related to a reduction in project hours worked for several large customers  certain price reductions and the expiration  on june   of a large government service contract 
a decrease of  in equipment sales resulted from lower voice equipment and lower computer equipment sales 
in  communication services increased  made up of computer services of  and equipment rentals of offset by decreases in repairs of  products sold increased  primarily in telephone systems and cabling with minor increases in computer hardware sales 
we believe these decreases partially related to the effects of increased competition and reductions in customer spending for communications related infrastructure and consulting services 
operating expenses decreased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in in  wages  benefits and subcontractor services decreased  material costs decreased related to the decline in revenue  depreciation decreased primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in and amortization decreased due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized 
in  labor and benefits accounted for more than of the expense increase 
operating losses increased  to  in and  to  in in the systems integration segment there will be a continued focus on the promotion and sale of managed services and professional services  which are both expected to generate recurring revenue

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  income taxes  revenues  contingencies and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  as further described below 

table of contents note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of all significant accounting policies that we follow in the preparation of our financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies as those that are the most significant to our financial statement presentation and that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition revenue for all of our business segments is recorded when services are provided or products are delivered  when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our rlec and clec pricing is subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments in future periods to revenues derived from our rlec and clec operations 
we monitor these proceedings closely and make adjustments to revenue accordingly 
we receive a portion of our interstate access revenues in our rlec segments from settlement pools in which we participate with other telephone companies through neca 
these pools were established at the direction of the fcc and are funded by interstate access service revenues  which the fcc regulates 
revenues earned through this pooling process are initially recognized based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the amount of interstate access revenues 
if the actual amounts that we receive from or pay into the settlement pools differ from the amounts that we have recorded as accounts receivables or accrued liabilities on our balance sheets  we are required to record the amount of such a reduction or increase as an adjustment to our earnings 
in  we recorded an increase in communications service revenue of approximately as a result of a change in our estimated interstate revenue earned from the neca pooling process 
our estimate is based on an fcc rule that mandates that refunds payable to long distance communication providers are not required for periods in which interstate rate of return exceeds fcc authorized levels if the rates for those periods were deemed to be lawful rates 
in and  we recorded communication service revenue of and  respectively  related to this estimate 
regulated asset depreciation we use a composite group remaining life method and straight line composite rates to depreciate the regulated property assets of our rlec and clec segments 
under this method  when we replace or retire such assets  the original cost of the asset  net of any salvage  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
the effect of this accounting is to amortize any gains or losses on dispositions over the service lives of the remaining regulated telephone property assets rather than recognizing such gain or loss in the period of retirement 
in addition  use of the composite group remaining life method requires that we periodically revise our depreciation rates 
such revisions are based on asset retirement activity  and often require that we make related estimates and assumptions 
if actual outcomes differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to adjust depreciation and amortization expense  which could impact our earnings 
during  we revised the estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets to update composite rates for our regulated telephone property 
this change resulted in lower depreciation expense in of approximately  in  we anticipate this change will result in lower depreciation expense of approximately  impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including our property  plant and equipment and our finite lived intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived 
table of contents assets 
recoverability is assessed based on future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for long lived assets  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by comparing carrying value to fair value 
there is a two step process for goodwill 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units to their carrying value 
if the results of the first step of the impairment testing indicate a potential impairment  the second step would be completed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balances of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  the market price of our stock and other factors 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
investment in unconsolidated affiliates we have investments and advances to affiliated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we periodically evaluate whether there have been declines in value in these investments  and if so  whether these declines are considered temporary or other than temporary 
other than temporary declines would be recognized as realized losses in earnings 
evidence of a loss in value includes  but is not limited to  our inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity  which would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
the fair value of an investment that is less than its book value may indicate a loss in value of the investment 
our evaluations are based on many factors  including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying amount  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors  and our intent and ability to hold the investment  including strategic factors 
retirement benefits retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by a company 
we record the costs of providing retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
in december  we adopted sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which provides expanded disclosures related to our employee benefit plans 
our estimates include assumptions regarding the discount rate to value the future obligation and the expected return on our plan assets 
we use discount rates in line with current market interest rates on high quality fixed rate debt securities 
our return on assets is based on our current expectation of the long term returns on assets held by the plan 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations  funding requirements and periodic benefit costs that we incur 
our pension expense for would have increased approximately if our assumed investment return were one quarter of a percent lower 
the expense would have increased approximately if our assumed discount rate were one quarter of a percent lower or decreased if our assumed discount rate were one quarter of a percent higher 

table of contents income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we have two categories of income taxes current and deferred 
current taxes are those amounts we expect to pay when we file our tax returns 
since we must report some of our revenues and expenses differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes  we record the tax effects of those differences as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are currently in effect 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for current income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset that we may not be able to use in the preparation and filing of our future tax returns 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements effective december   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  as of december   the company has determined it does not have a material legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  thus the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the compensation cost of the award is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  ie the requisite service period usually the vesting period

additionally  compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the cost of the unvested portion of the award is recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and changes in our leverage ratio which may increase the margin added to the interest rate as provided in our loan agreement 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows in thousands fixed interest rates secured term loans subject to interest rate fluctuations senior secured revolving credit facility senior secured term loans total debt as part of our loan covenant conditions  we have arranged interest rate protection on a minimum of one half of the total amount of senior indebtedness outstanding  with a weighted average life of at least years 
as of december   our debt is as follows principal average rate fair value rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps fixed rate debt  rates fixed for twelve years total fixed rates of total debt variable rate debt of total debt total debt if interest rates rise above the rates of the variable debt  we could incur extra interest expense of for each basis points above the current rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize reductions in interest expense of approximately for each basis point decrease in rates 
the interest rate swaps were arranged to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
the swaps were arranged with banks that participate in our senior indebtedness 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we 
table of contents agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled quarterly 
terms of swaps notional amounts average pay rate average received rate fair value asset liability to to to to if interest rates rise above the rates fixed by these swaps  we could realize other income of for each basis points above the fixed rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately for each basis point decrease in rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  it is not considered to be material
