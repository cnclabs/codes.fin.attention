item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
overview rock of ages is an integrated quarrier  manufacturer  distributor and retailer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
during  we had three business segments  quarrying  manufacturing  and retail 
the quarry division sells granite blocks both to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers outside north america 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sells granite memorials directly to consumers 
our quarry group had a difficult year in compared to last year largely as a result of a decline in export shipments primarily to our customers in china 
the largest decline occurred in our salisbury pink and gardenia white quarries in north carolina where shipments were down and  respectively  due to higher inventories in the supply chain as well as what we believe were more restrictive credit policies affecting our customers in china during our bethel white quarry sales were slightly below levels 
early in  we have seen some signs of an increase in inspections of blocks by our customers at our salisbury pink and gardenia white quarries 
we anticipate some recovery of export shipments from those quarries in the balance of  although we cannot provide any assurances in this regard 
results from our other  primarily domestic  quarries were down in by slightly under from due in part to short term demand fluctuations as well as some longer term negative trends caused by competition from imported granites 
we continue to aggressively market our products in the us and abroad and continue to take cost cutting measures and make productivity improvements to adjust to market conditions 
the manufacturing division had a strong year in due primarily to increased revenues from mausoleums and larger estate and feature memorials 
such large memorials generally have higher than average profit margins 
demand for these and other large memorial projects remains strong and has offset the decline in orders and shipments of the lower end memorials generally sold by our authorized retailers 
we have determined that increasing our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in an effort to grow the business with our authorized retailer base a strategy we adopted late in has not been effective 
we therefore took steps late in to reduce sg a in line with sales 
the current climate for manufacturing is very competitive  with imported products becoming more common 
we will continue to pursue a strategy of focusing on the mausoleum and large features market where our product is superior and margins are generally higher 
we will also utilize and further explore outsourcing relationships including importing from areas like china and india  as appropriate  for the lower end business 
the retail segment s revenue was up in compared with following the modest increase achieved in  this compares favorably with the downward trend observed beginning in our gross margin  at in  was lower than the previous years  primarily due to tactical errors in pricing and mix assumptions when we changed our branding program and implemented a new pricing grid early in we continue to address the mix issue with our sales force through training and incentives and we have adjusted the price levels for to meet our minimum gross margin target 
retail sg a was higher in than as we invested in people and programs focused on improving sales  including the branding initiative  marketing plan and sales force compensation restructuring 
in the third quarter of we took aggressive action to improve sg a productivity 
through a combination of headcount reductions and related operational enhancements developed during the quarter  we believe our sales force will be able to operate more efficiently with a smaller managerial staff 
we expect these steps will reduce sg a at both the store and overhead level in our retail operations in our future success depends on increasing revenues from our existing retail stores through outreach programs with funeral homes and cemeteries to maximize revenues per store by expanding share and market area 
in addition  we continue to work to expand and improve the distribution of our product through our owned stores  authorized dealers  funeral homes  and cemeteries 
critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred income taxes  contingencies and accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits 
revenue recognition quarry division the granite we quarry is sold both to outside customers and used by our manufacturing group 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks to outside customers when the granite is shipped and invoiced from the quarry 
we provide a discount for domestic customers if payment is made within days of purchase  except in the case of december terms described below 
sales to foreign customers are typically secured by a letter of credit 
at our barre  vermont quarries  we allow customers to purchase granite blocks and request that we store the blocks for them 
many of our customers do not have adequate storage space at their facilities and want to ensure an adequate supply of blocks  especially when the barre quarries are closed from mid december through mid march because of weather 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from blocks purchased when the customer selects and identifies the block at the quarry site and the customer requests the block be stored  when they have significant business reasons to do so 
at that time  the block is removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
the customer is invoiced and normal payment terms apply  except in the case of december terms described below 
granite blocks owned by customers remain on our property for varying periods of time after title 
we retain a delivery obligation using our trucks 
however  we consider the earnings process substantially complete because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the selling price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified at the quarry 
each december  we offer special payment terms to our barre quarries customers 
as noted above  from approximately mid december to approximately mid march  our barre quarries are closed due to weather 
during this time  the quarry customers manufacturing plants remain open  and many prefer to ensure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december are invoiced on or about december and  at that time  the blocks are removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the blocks  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the barre quarries are closed notwithstanding the customer purchases a three month supply in december and makes payments over days 
customers need not use these special december terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with the normal day payment terms 
manufacturing rock of ages does not record a sale at the time granite is transferred to the manufacturing division from our quarries 
we record revenue and gross profit related to internally transferred granite only after the granite is manufactured into a finished product and sold to an outside customer 
manufacturing revenues related to outside customers are recorded when the finished product is shipped from our facilities or set in the cemetery  if we are responsible for the setting 
revenues related to internally transferred finished products to our owned retail outlets are not recorded as manufacturing revenues  they are recorded as revenue by the retail division when ultimately sold to an outside customer 
retail retail revenues are recorded when the finished monument is set in the cemetery 
in certain instances  we may enter into an agreement with a customer that provides for extended payments terms  generally up to a year from either the date of setting the memorial or  in certain instances  upon the settlement of an estate 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of the undepreciated cost of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of the assets depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our services  sustainability of gross margins and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we assess impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step test be performed 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit will be compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
in the third quarter of we performed our annual assessment for the retail unit 
we calculated the fair value of the retail unit based on estimated expected discounted future cash flows using the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we concluded that the retail unit could not support the goodwill booked in the last two acquisitions and therefore have written off all of the retail goodwill of  in the third quarter 
as a result  we have no goodwill on our balance sheet for retail operations 
we likewise have no goodwill on our balance sheet for our manufacturing operations 
the goodwill on our balance sheet at december  of  relates to the rockwell quarry acquisition  which was completed in the first quarter of in connection with quarries that we acquire  any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired is first applied to identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists  with any excess assigned to goodwill 
valuation of deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the current and deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of current and deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
this assessment is made each reporting period 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the recent levels of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company believed it was not more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax assets 
as such  we adjusted our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset which resulted in a charge to tax expense of  in the second quarter of at the end of the year  we reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from its us operations in the future 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details on the valuation of deferred income taxes 
based on the levels of taxable income from our us operations  utilization of tax loss carry forwards and potential adjustments in the level of the tax valuation allowance  the company s effective tax rate may vary considerably from year to year 
contingencies we are involved in various types of legal proceedings from time to time 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and risks  including  but not limited to  court rulings  judgments  negotiations between affected parties and government action 
management  with the assistance of its outside advisors  assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits we provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of our employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rates 
in we decreased the discount rate used to determine our liability in the pension plan from to based on a bond matching model which uses data on individual high quality corporate bonds and the timing and amount of the future benefit payments in our plan to develop a weighted discount rate specific to our plan 
in order to make informed assumptions  we rely on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
any changes in one or more of these assumptions may materially affect certain amounts reported on our balance sheet 
in particular  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or a further decrease in discount rate could result in an increase in our pension liability and a charge to equity as well as increases in pension expenses over time 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing gross profit  which are shown as a percentage of quarry  manufacturing and retail revenues  respectively 
year ended december  as restated as restated statement of operations data net revenues quarry manufacturing retail total net revenues gross profit quarry manufacturing retail total gross profit selling  general administrative expenses gain on sale of investments impairment of note receivable adverse judgment and legal expenses foreign exchange loss income loss from continuing operations interest expense income loss from continuing operations before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net income loss as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has restated its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and to reflect the adjustments in the statements of operations related to the classification of shipping and handling costs in order to be compliant with emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs in its quarry and manufacturing segments 
the company s prior method of accounting for certain freight costs to deliver products to their customer s designated location was to include these costs as a deduction from net revenues 
such costs are now included in cost of sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue decreased  gross profit decreased and total selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for were million  down or million from this decline was primarily as a result of decreased shipments from our salisbury pink and gardenia white quarries to overseas customers 
shipments from these quarries were down million from levels 
our export shipments declined as a result of several factors  including our customers existing inventory levels as well as what we believe were credit restrictions imposed by the chinese central bank in an effort to slow construction spending 
shipments from our vermont and pennsylvania quarries were down approximately  from levels  despite an improvement in the pace of sales in the fourth quarter  particularly in the bethel  vermont quarry 
gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for decreased  and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from of revenue for to of revenue for the decreases in gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percentage of revenue were largely a result of higher repair and maintenance expenses  absorption of additional expenses associated with the rockwell quarry acquisition in the second quarter of  write off of retired fixed assets in the pennsylvania quarry  lowered production due to mechanical failure of a derrick in our barre quarry and lower operational efficiencies associated with a decrease in revenue 
sg a expenses in our quarry segment decreased  or  in from levels 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing operations for increased from primarily as a result of strong shipments of mausoleums as well as an increase in sales of industrial products 
at december   our backlog of mausoleum orders and typical memorial products was million   higher than the december  level 
gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group increased from the level and gross profit as a percentage of manufacturing revenue increased percentage points  to for the increase in gross profit margin is a result of the positive effect higher revenues have on reducing certain fixed costs as a percentage of revenue in our operations  as well as higher revenues from mausoleum and feature memorials which typically have above average gross margins 
manufacturing sg a expenses for increased compared with this was as a result of an increase to the management fee charged to our canadian manufacturing division by the us affiliate which is offset by lower corporate overhead  and the additional people and programs put in place to expand our sales to current authorized retailers and to add new authorized retailers 
we have concluded that this effort has not been effective and have taken steps to reduce the sg a expenses 
retail segment analysis revenues in our retail operations for increased from we believe the increase is a direct result of the initiatives undertaken in to improve our product mix  implement the branding strategy  develop a marketing plan and revamp the retail sales counselor compensation structure 
our order receipts in decreased compared with our backlog was million at december   down from million at december  gross profit dollars from retail operations decreased from levels and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points compared with we attribute these declines to errors in our assumptions about pricing and mix of craftsmanship levels when we established our new branding initiative and overhauled our pricing early in we have raised and adjusted our pricing and we are targeting a return to the historical level of or higher gross margin percentage 
sg a expenses from our retail operations increased for compared to and sg a expenses as a percentage of retail revenue increased percentage points from the increase in sg a was a result of the expenses associated with the various investments in people and programs related to changing our product mix  branding strategy  marketing plan  retail sales counselor compensation structure  pricing policy  and other items 
while we continued to focus on the new branding and pricing programs introduced early in  during the second half of the year we developed a retail store staffing plan that  through a combination of headcount reductions and related operational enhancements  focuses on the productivity of our sales force and  we believe  will allow us to operate more efficiently with a smaller managerial staff 
we implemented the plan during the fourth quarter and by the end of the year we had made the associated staffing reductions and we had paid or accrued associated severance costs 
we expect this will reduce retail sg a expenses approximately to in as compared to consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead in was million essentially unchanged from in october  we sold our investment in ffs financial  recording a gain of  foreign exchange losses in were  compared to  in resulting from the effect of the fluctuating value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
interest expense increased from  in to million in as a result of an increase in the amount of debt outstanding during the year and higher interest rates on our credit facilities 
the higher debt levels were due to the operating losses sustained during  the rockwell quarry and the mccolly retail store acquisitions  and changes in working capital 
income tax expense for was million  compared with a benefit of  in in the second quarter of  the company made the determination that  based on the results of the previous three years coupled with current year actual and then projected operating results and the guidance in sfas  we could not estimate that the company will more likely than not generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax assets the company has generated over the years 
as such  we adjusted our valuation allowance against the net us deferred tax assets to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax assets 
after reviewing the results at the end of the year  we continued to fully reserve for the entire net deferred tax asset 
as required by sfas  we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from its us operations in the future 
until or unless that occurs  we will show essentially no tax except for canadian tax expense in periods when we have earnings  until we generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of our net us deferred tax assets 
these actions do not affect the cash taxes paid by the company 
the company s canadian subsidiary provided for income taxes payable in canada of  in compared to  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue increased  gross profit increased and total sg a expenses increased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  increased from primarily as a result of increased shipments from our gardenia white and pennsylvania black quarries as well as an increase in shipments from the galactic blue quarry in the ukraine 
both gardenia white and bethel white were very popular export granites and our improved production of gardenia white provided more stone available for sale 
recoveries in our pennsylvania black quarry improved in as we progressed through a difficult part of the quarry  which also provided us with increases in production and sales 
finally  our new venture in the galactic blue quarry in the ukraine continued to improve production  which also led to higher revenues 
these increases in revenue were somewhat offset by a decrease in revenue from our salisbury pink quarry where demand for that export product was somewhat lower than anticipated 
our barre gray quarry continued to face competition from imported granites  especially colored granites  which may decrease demand for granite from this quarry over time  however revenue levels in were relatively consistent with gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for the year ended december  increased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points to from the increase in gross profit was primarily the result of higher revenues and higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue in our pennsylvania black quarry as well as smaller increases in our gardenia white quarry as a result of higher revenues 
these increases were offset by a decrease in gross profit in our bethel white quarry due to higher than normal repair and maintenance expenses in sg a expenses in our quarry segment for increased from primarily due to increased travel expenses required to support our granite export sales efforts as well as higher bonus payments paid to quarry personnel for the improved results 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing group for the year ended december  increased from the increase was primarily a result of increased shipments from our precision products group as a result of greater demand for their products 
this increase was offset by a decrease in shipments from the memorials group primarily as a result of not being able to ship approximately  in mausoleums and estate memorials in the fourth quarter of due to incomplete foundations  which are the responsibility of the customer 
gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group declined and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the slight decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in shipments from the memorials group  especially the larger and more expensive memorials  mausoleums and estate memorials 
sg a expenses for the manufacturing group were up over the prior year primarily as a result of increased sales personnel hired in the memorials group in order to implement our growth plans 
retail segment analysis revenues in our retail operations were marginally higher than the prior year  and while this is not a significant improvement in dollars  we were pleased that the retail group reversed the trend observed since of declining revenues 
we implemented significant changes in our retail division during while the changes were helpful in stabilizing our core market in the short term  some of these changes  including a new chief operating officer  a change in compensation structure  changes to our product offerings and pricing  among other things  may have distracted our sales force somewhat 
gross profit dollars for the retail operations in was essentially unchanged from and gross profit as a percentage of revenue was also essentially unchanged from sg a expenses in retail in increased from the prior year primarily as a result of additional personnel and programs which were aimed at increasing revenues in the retail segment  severance payments  and additional sales compensation expense as a result of converting our sales force from commission based to salary based 
consolidated items in  we recognized an impairment of  on a long term note receivable which dated back to the sale of a manufacturing plant in elberton  georgia in in the fourth quarter of  we were in a dispute with the buyer and determined this note was not collectable in its entirety and negotiated a payment of  in cash to the company and a remaining note for  which will be repaid through the purchase of product from childs childs 
in return  a supply agreement requiring us to buy all of our elberton memorials from the buyer was terminated 
unallocated corporate overhead increased from the prior year primarily as a result of expenses associated with executive searches for our memorials group as well as consulting expenses associated with the company s sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
expenses related to the adverse arbitral award and legal expenses were million in compared to million in the charge consists entirely of the million settlement amount paid to eurimex 
the charges in were for legal and associated expenses relating entirely to the eurimex arbitration 
foreign exchange loss in was  compared to  in resulting from the effect of the fluctuating value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
interest expense increased from  to  primarily as a result of higher borrowings and higher interest rates in compared to the increased borrowings resulted from an increase in long term debt from the investment in forethought financial services and an increase in short term borrowings on our revolving credit facility primarily as a result of payment of the eurimex settlement amount 
the interest rate paid on our credit facility is tied primarily to libor  which increased throughout due to the restructuring of our debt facility in the second quarter of we wrote off an additional  of deferred financing charges  which also contributed to the increase 
income tax benefit  as a percentage of pre tax income  decreased to for from an expense of in our tax rate is significantly affected by the fact that we operate in both the us and canada and have historically had different tax rates in those jurisdictions 
we expect our canadian tax rate to remain approximately and our us tax rate to range from to 
it is very difficult to predict an expected blended rate for the company for  as it is heavily dependent on pre tax earnings in those jurisdictions 
the lower blended effective tax rate in was due to higher losses in the us resulting from the eurimex payment 
we had a loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  in as a result of the sale of the autumn rose quarry 
this compares to income  net of taxes  of  in broken down as follows we had a gain on the sale of the cemetery operations of  this gain was offset by the loss from operations of the cemeteries in of  an impairment charge of  for the discontinued autumn rose quarry  and the loss from the operations of the autumn rose quarry of  we had no remaining discontinued operations held for sale as of december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity we consider our liquidity to be adequate to meet our long and short term cash requirements to fund operations 
historically  we have met these requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
our operating results and changes in working capital in have required us to increase our borrowings under our credit facility 
we actively monitor our cash requirements and adjust those requirements as needed particularly with regard to acquisitions and capital spending 
we do not anticipate any requirements for additional financing in the next months beyond what is available to us under our existing credit facilities 
in  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan decreased by approximately million primarily as a result of a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the pension benefit obligation from to 
we have historically contributed between  and million per year to the plan and we contributed  in the company is not required to make any additional contributions in  however we expect to contribute  to the defined benefit plan during  which  we believe  we will be able to fund either from cash from operations or borrowing under our credit facilities 
cash flow at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  cash from operations 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to  in the primary reason for the change is the lower earnings in  excluding the effect of the significant decrease in deferred tax assets coupled with the non cash adjustments of depreciation and the write down of goodwill and the decrease in customer deposits and increase in inventories  and other working capital changes  which had the effect of decreasing cash from operations 
net cash used in operating activities was  in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in the primary reason for the change is the lower earnings in due in significant part to the million eurimex settlement payment coupled with the non cash adjustments primarily from an increase in deferred taxes related to the eurimex settlement and an increase in inventory as well as other working capital changes  which had the effect of decreasing cash from operations 
cash from investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in in our capital spending was million primarily as a result of continued investment in our quarry  retail and manufacturing operations  and an additional million for the acquisition of the rockwell quarry and the mccolly retail locations 
these were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our ffs investment of million 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in in  our capital spending was million 
in addition  we used million in cash to make investments  primarily a million investment in ffs 
this cash used was partially offset by the receipt of million primarily from the payment of a note  which we had received in as partial consideration for the sale of our cemeteries 
cash used in investing activities generally comes from either borrowings under our credit facilities or from operations 
cash from financing activities 
financing activities provided million in which included million under our line of credit and under our long term note  less million paid on our long term note and  paid in dividends 
financing activities provided million in as a result of increased borrowings under our line of credit  an increase in borrowing under our long term note as well as cash provided from employees exercising stock options 
this was partially offset by the payment of dividends 
capital resources cit credit facility we have a credit facility with the cit group business credit and chittenden trust company the lenders that consists of an acquisition term loan line of credit of up to million and a revolving credit facility of up to another million based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
the credit facility expires in october as of december   we had million outstanding and million available under the term loan line of credit and million outstanding and million available under the revolving credit facility 
pursuant to the further amendment defined below the lenders have placed a reserve of million against availability under the revolving credit facility with the lenders retaining the right to over advance at their discretion 
the lenders also agreed to transfer million of the revolving loan balance to term debt  as that amount was expended for acquisitions and new store openings which qualify under the term credit facility 
in addition  million of the proceeds from the sale of our investment in ffs holdings  inc see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements was credited to term debt 
the credit facility loan agreement places restrictions on our ability to  among other things  sell assets  participate in mergers  incur debt  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  repurchase stock and make investments or guarantees 
the credit facility agreement also contains certain covenants for a minimum operating cash flow to debt service ratio the ratio and a limit on the total liabilities to net worth ratio of the company 
initially  the facility required the ratio of the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less taxes and capital expenditures to the sum of interest and scheduled debt repayments be at least for any trailing twelve month period at the end of a quarter 
as a result of significant eurimex arbitration expenses  and operating losses  we have been in violation of this covenant and have received waivers and amendments of these covenants from our lenders 
on august  we signed an amendment to the credit facility the amendment which reduced the ratio for a period of time  increased the interest rates on the outstanding balances on both the term loans and revolving credit facility by basis points and contained other provisions 
the interest rate will be automatically reduced by basis points if and when we deliver audited financial statements to our lenders showing that the ratio for the trailing months ending december  is at least to as of october   we were in violation of the amended ratio as set forth in the amendment primarily as a result of operating results 
on november   we received and executed a further amendment to the ratio allowing us to be in compliance with our credit facility at october  the further amendment 
in the further amendment our lenders have agreed to adjust the required covenant levels for the balance of and we were in compliance with those adjusted covenants at december  and we believe it is probable we will be in compliance with those adjusted covenants in the further amendment also limits annual capital expenses to million beginning in  and prohibits the payment of dividends without the prior consent of the lenders 
we believe it is unlikely we will receive bank consent to pay dividends in the further amendment also increases the interest rates on the outstanding balances of the term loans and the revolving credit facility by a further basis points until june   at which time the interest rate will be reduced by basis points so long as we are not in default of the credit facility 
finally  our lenders imposed a fee of  in connection with the further amendment 
the facility also requires that the ratio of the company s total liabilities to net worth not exceed as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant as our total liabilities to net worth ratio was we have a multi tiered interest rate structure on our outstanding debt with cit 
we can elect the interest rate structure under the credit facility based on the prime rate or libor for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
the incremental rate above or below prime and above libor is based on our funded debt to net worth ratio 
based on this ratio  our current rates are basis points higher than the lowest incremental rates currently available to us 
in addition  as disclosed above  the incremental interest rates under our credit facility were increased by a total of basis points during in connection with the amendment and the further amendment 
accordingly  the incremental rates currently available to us will be basis points higher for both the revolver and term loans unless and until the conditions for reducing the interest rate increases described above are net 
the following table shows the libor or prime rate elections libor election prime election revolving credit facility libor prime term loans libor prime the rates in effect as of december  were as follows amount outstanding formula effective rate revolving credit facility 
million prime revolving credit facility million libor term loan a million libor term loan b million libor term loan at prime

contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total obligations long term debt consists of various notes payable see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for general business use and strategic acquisitions and estimated interest thereon  which will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities 
obligations of million under our revolving credit facility at december  are not included in this table 
operating leases are principally for real estate and vehicles see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities 
the purchase obligation consists of a supply agreement with adams granite co 
the company has agreed to purchase a minimum of  of monuments from adams granite each year for a term of seven years with various stipulations as to variations from the minimum order and pricing agreements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our existing credit facilities 
the agreement was entered into on january  and the remaining term is three years 
we also had an exclusive distribution agreement with memory medallion inc mmi  in which the company had agreed to buy million of memory medallions over two years with quarterly payments of  which began on august  subsequent to year end  the agreement was amended to grant the company non exclusive rights to market the medallions and discontinue the purchase obligation 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the table  we have obligations to fund pension plans 
the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time 
therefore  these obligations are not included in the table
