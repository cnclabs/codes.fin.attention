revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of service fee revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in service fee revenue is primarily due to the growth of our customer base and the migration of our existing customers from our simple plan price point of per month to the power pro plan at per month and the premier plan at higher price points  resulting in higher service fee revenue per customer 
as of december   power pro plan or premier plan customers accounted for of total registered customers as compared to as of december  as a percentage of total revenue  service fee revenue decreased four percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in service fee revenue as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the increase in revenue from our photostamps product 
we expect total service fee revenue to continue to increase in future periods on an absolute basis as we complete the migration of our simple plan customers to the power pro plan and as we continue to increase our customer base 
as a percentage of revenue  service fee revenue may decline over future periods if the usps allows us to continue to sell photostamps beyond the end of our second test period 
photostamps revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenue  photostamps revenue increased eight percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal the photostamps revenue increase  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the increase in customer orders as a result of our marketing efforts  and from seasonal demand during the holiday period 
if the usps approves our continued sale of photostamps we expect this revenue category to increase on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenue 
product sales and other revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily due to the expansion of our consumable and supplies sales through our supplies store and enhanced insurance sales as a result of our continued effort to market to our existing customers

as a percentage of total revenue  product sales and other revenue decreased four percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of greater increases in revenue from service fees and photostamps 
we expect product sales and other revenue to continue to increase on an absolute basis as we add additional skus to our supplies store  and as we continue to market the use of our insurance offering to our existing and new customers

cost of service revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of four percent 
as a percentage of total revenue  cost of service revenue decreased ten percentage points from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in total cost of service is a result of a decrease in promotional expense  offset by an increase in cost of sales owing to an increase in credit card processing fees and an increase in customer support costs 
the decrease in promotional expense is attributable to the decrease in the redemption rate of our promotional offerings as well as a reduced carrying cost of promotional items 
promotional expenses are primarily incurred as customers are acquired and thereby may not correlate directly with changes in revenue

promotional expense  which represents a material portion of total cost of service revenue  is expensed in the period in which a customer is acquired 
however  the revenue associated with the acquired customer is earned over the customer s lifetime 
therefore  promotional expense for newly acquired customers may be higher than the revenue earned from those customers in that period 
the increase in credit card processing fees is a result of higher total revenue levels 
the increase in customer support costs is a result of growth in the customer support workforce needed to support more customers

as a percentage of total revenue  cost of photostamps revenue increased five percentage points from four percent in fiscal to nine percent in fiscal the cost of photostamps revenue increase  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenue  is primarily due to the increase in customer orders as a result of our marketing efforts  and from seasonal strength from holiday demands

cost of product sales and other revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of

as a percentage of total revenue  cost of product sales and other revenue decreased two percentage points from six percent in fiscal to two percent in fiscal we expect the cost of product sales and other revenue to continue to increase in future periods which is consistent with the aforementioned expectation that product sales and other revenue will also increase in future periods

therefore  promotional expenses for newly acquired customers may be higher than the revenue earned from those customers in that period 
for this reason  the cost of service revenue increases may not correlate to the increases in service revenue for the same period

net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily from the sale of investments to fund the return of capital cash dividend in february in addition  we purchased additional investments as we continued to increase operating cash flow in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the proceeds from the exercise of our stock options and issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase program 
in addition  we paid a return of capital cash dividend of approximately million in february we believe our available cash and marketable securities  together with the cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our business for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted in the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  we expect to adopt statement r on january  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement r  during the fiscal periods presented herein  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we estimate the adoption of statement r may result in an increase to operating expenses in the amount of approximately million for the year ended december  however  this estimate may vary as it will depend on factors such as the level of share based payments granted in the future 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approx imated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operation cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were in  and in may the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections statement  which replaces apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirement for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized with a cumulative effect adjustment in net income of the period of the change 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and investments are comprised of money market  us government obligations and public corporate debt securities with weighted average maturities of days at december  our cash equivalents and investments  net of restricted cash  approximated million and had a related weighted average interest rate of approximately 
interest rate fluctuations impact the carrying value of the portfolio 
we do not believe that the future market risks related to the above securities will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity
