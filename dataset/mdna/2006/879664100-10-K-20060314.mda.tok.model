quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments in marketable securities during the normal course of business  we invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in marketable securities for a discussion of our investments in marketable securities for the fiscal years ended december   and december   see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report  included herein as exhibit  and incorporated herein by reference 
financial instruments and market risk we conduct business on a global basis in several major currencies and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
in response to this risk  we developed a foreign currency exposure management policy to mitigate financial exposure to changing foreign exchange rates resulting from nonfunctional currency receivables and payables that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
in  we expanded our policy to include hedging of currency exposures anticipated within the year 
we used foreign currency forward contracts and a limited number of currency options to manage our foreign currency exposure 
we enter into derivative foreign exchange contracts only to the extent necessary to meet our overall goal of minimizing nonfunctional foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for speculative purposes 
non designated hedges we do not engage in hedging specific individual transactions when addressing currency risks associated with nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities that are re measured through income 
instead  we use derivatives to manage overall exposure levels for specific currencies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we record all related forward foreign exchange contracts on the balance sheet at fair value 
forward foreign exchange contracts receivable are included in miscellaneous receivables and other current assets  while forward foreign exchange contracts payable are included as part of other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of these instruments are included in earnings as part of other expense  net 
we had a net loss on forward foreign exchange contracts of million in  a net gain of million in and a net gain of million in cash flow hedges in  we identified and quantified currency risks associated with european operations where operations and product costs were denominated in euros and the related revenue was denominated in us dollars 
to mitigate some of this risk  we entered into forward and option currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges 
throughout the year  we conducted effectiveness tests on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges on a spot to spot basis excluding time value  with the time value portion recorded in other expense  net 
we reclassified the effective gains and losses accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income to operating expenses when the hedged transaction was recognized in earnings 
we reclassified all derivative hedged exposures for periods less than months and all of our million loss accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income to operating expenses by our year end 
we did not hold any derivatives designated as cash flow hedges at year end 
derivative financial instruments involve elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the financial statements 
the market risk that results from these instruments relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which are generally offset by changes in the value of the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of our derivative contracts 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large international financial institutions with high credit ratings 
in addition  we also limit the aggregate notional amount of agreements entered into with any one financial institution to mitigate credit risk 
our net foreign currency exposure is diversified among a broad number of currencies 
the notional amounts reflected in the following table represent the us dollar values of the agreed upon amounts that will be delivered to a third party on the agreed upon date dollars in millions weighted average contract rate notional value of forward contracts maturing in forward contracts at forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for euro united states dollar other currencies forward contracts to buy foreign currencies for euro british pound other currencies forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for danish kroner united states dollar forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for british pound euro forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for us dollar mexican peso euro british pound other currencies forward contracts to buy foreign currencies for us dollar singapore dollar japanese yen other currencies forward contracts to buy foreign currencies for thai baht united states dollar total contracts outstanding at december  dollars in millions weighted average contract rate notional value of forward contracts maturing in forward contracts at forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for euro united states dollar other currencies forward contracts to buy foreign currencies for euro british pound other currencies forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for danish kroner united states dollar forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for british pound euro forward contracts to sell foreign currencies for us dollar mexican peso other currencies forward contracts to buy foreign currencies for us dollar canadian dollar other currencies forward contracts to buy foreign currencies for thai baht united states dollar total contracts outstanding at december  pursuant to our policy  we entered into most of the above contracts immediately prior to the respective year ends 
accordingly  the carrying value of such contracts at december   and december   approximates fair value
