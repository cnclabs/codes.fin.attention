the fee paid by the sender generally is based on the principal amount of the transaction and the location to which the funds are to be transferred 
this transaction fee is set by western union and is recorded as revenue 
the company derives additional revenue from currency exchange spreads on money transfers that are paid out in a currency other than the one that was sent 
these spreads are the difference between the retail currency exchange rate provided to the individual consumer and the wholesale rate received when western union trades in larger blocks of currencies in the international money market 
generally  there are two agent locations involved in a money transfer transaction  the agent initiating the transaction the send agent and the agent disbursing funds the receive agent 
the send and receive agents each earn a commission generally based on a percentage of the fee charged to the customer 
these commissions are included in cost of services in the consolidated statements of income 
some agents outside the us also receive additional commissions based on a portion of the foreign exchange revenue associated with money transfer transactions 
approximately of the company s consumer to consumer transactions involve at least one non us location

the company invests these funds in high quality investments to minimize its exposure to credit risks 
these investments primarily are in high quality  tax free municipal bonds 
in a retail money order transaction  a consumer purchases a money order from an agent 
the agent selling the money order generally remits the funds collected from the consumer to the company within a matter of days of the transaction date 
an agent generally does not receive a commission on the sale of a money order  but is compensated by charging a fee to the consumer 
in an official check transaction  a consumer will procure an official check from one of the company s agents  typically a financial institution 
the official check agent generally is required to remit the funds collected from the consumer to the company the following day 
the company pays its official check agents commissions based on short term variable interest rates and the balance of outstanding official checks attributable to the individual agent

merchant services revenues from external customers  operating profit  and assets represent the following percentages of fdc s consolidated revenues  total reported segment and all other and corporate operating profit  and consolidated assets revenue from external customers operating profit assets description of merchant services segment operations in the merchant services segment  the company s revenues are derived primarily from transaction and processing service fees collected from merchants for credit and debit card transactions 
merchant services businesses facilitate the acceptance of consumer transactions at the point of sale  whether it is transactions at a physical merchant location  over the internet or at an atm 
a brief explanation of the segment s service and product offerings is presented below 
merchant acquiring and processing services the merchant acquiring services facilitate the merchants ability to accept credit and debit cards by authorizing  capturing and settling the merchants credit  debit  stored value and loyalty card transactions 
acquiring services also provide pos devices and other equipment necessary to capture merchant transactions 
a majority of these services are offered to the merchants through joint ventures or similar alliance arrangements with financial institutions 
the segment s processing services include authorization  transaction capture  settlement  chargeback handling  and internet based transaction processing 
the vast majority of these services pertain to transactions in which consumer payments to merchants are made through visa or mastercard 
revenues are generated from discount fees charged to a merchant net of credit card interchange and assessment fees charged by the bankcard associations visa and mastercard 
the discount fee is either a percentage of the credit card transaction or the interchange fee plus a fixed dollar amount  processing fees charged to unconsolidated alliances discussed below  processing fees charged to merchant acquirers who have outsourced their transaction processing to first data merchant services fdms  equity earnings from unconsolidated alliances  selling and leasing pos devices  and debit network fees 
the company and its alliances provided merchant processing services to approximately million merchant locations worldwide in the company and its alliances provided full service merchant processing primarily on visa and mastercard transactions and pin debit at the point of sale 
growth in the merchant services business is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships  new and enhanced product and service offerings  cross selling products and services into existing relationships  the shift of consumer spending to increased usage of electronic forms of payment and the strength of its alliance partnerships with banks and financial institutions 
the company s alliance structures take on different forms  including consolidated subsidiaries  equity method investments and revenue sharing arrangements 
under the alliance program  the company and a bank form a joint venture  either contractually or through a separate legal entity 
generally merchant contracts are contributed to the venture by the company and or the bank 
new merchant business is solicited by the alliance s and in some cases  the financial institution s sales force 
each alliance requires successful management of the relationship between the company and the financial institution alliance partner 
the company benefits by providing processing services for the alliance and its merchant customers  while the financial institution partner benefits by maintaining the merchant banking relationship 
alliance financial institutions provide card association sponsorship  clearing  and settlement services 
the company provides transaction processing and related functions  both owners may provide management  marketing  and other administrative services 
the alliance strategy could be affected by further consolidation among financial institutions 
the alliance strategy with bank partners provides the company with broad geographic coverage  regionally  nationally and internationally 
the alliance partners have presence in various industries that have a wide product mix  which allows for the company to enter into these multiple markets and provide coverage through the alliance partnership 
the alliance structure allows first data to be the processor for multiple financial institutions  any one of which may be selected by the merchant as their bank partner 
additionally  bank partners provide brand loyalty and a distribution channel through their branch networks which increases merchant retention 
there are a number of different entities involved in a merchant transaction including the cardholder  card issuer  card association  merchant  merchant acquirer  electronic processor for credit and signature debit transactions  and debit network for pin debit transactions 
the card issuer is the financial institution that issues credit or debit cards  authorizes transactions after determining whether the cardholder has sufficient available credit or funds for the transaction  and provides funds for the transaction 
some of these functions may be performed by an electronic processor such as the card issuing services businesses on behalf of the issuer 
the card association is visa or mastercard or a debit network such as star that routes the transactions between the company and the card issuer 
the merchant is a business from which a product or service is purchased by a cardholder 
the acquirer such as the company or one of its alliances contracts with merchants to facilitate their acceptance of cards 
a merchant acquirer may do its own processing or  more commonly  may outsource those functions to an electronic processor such as the company 
the acquirer processor serves as an intermediary between the merchant and the card issuer by obtaining authorization from the card issuer through a card association or debit network  transmitting the transaction to the card issuer through the applicable card association or debit network  and paying the merchant for the transaction 
the company typically receives the funds from the issuer via the card association or debit network prior to paying the merchant 
a transaction occurs when a cardholder purchases something from a merchant who has contracted with the company  an alliance or a processing customer 
when the merchant swipes the card through the pos terminal which is often sold or leased  and serviced by the company  the company obtains authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the card association or debit network  verifying that the cardholder has sufficient credit or adequate funds for the transaction 
once the card issuer approves the transaction  the company or the alliance acquires the transaction from the merchant and then transmits it to the applicable debit network or card association  which then routes the transaction information to the card issuer 
upon receipt of the transaction  the card issuer delivers funds to the company via the card association or debit network 
generally  the company funds the merchant after receiving the money from the card association or debit network 
each participant in the transaction receives compensation for processing the transaction 
for example  in a transaction using a visa or mastercard for with a merchant discount rate ie  fee of  the card issuer will fund the association and bill the cardholder on its monthly statement 
the card association will retain assessment fees of and forward to the company 
the company will retain and pay the merchant 
the retained by the card issuer is referred to as interchange and it  like assessment fees  is set by the card association 
the company and its alliances  as merchant acquirers  have certain contingent liabilities for the transactions acquired from merchants 
this contingent liability arises in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder s favor 
in such a case  the transaction is charged back to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder 
the company may  however  collect this amount from the card association if the amount was disputed in error 
if the company or alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant  due to the merchant s insolvency or other reasons  the company or alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder 
in most cases  this contingent liability situation is unlikely to arise because most products or services are delivered when purchased  and credits are issued on returned items 
however  where the product or service is not provided until sometime following the purchase eg  airline or cruise ship tickets  the risk is greater 
the company often mitigates its risk by obtaining collateral from merchants considered higher risk because they have a time delay in the delivery of services  operate in industries that experience chargebacks or are less creditworthy 
debit network acquiring and processing services debit network acquiring and processing services include atm processing  star network access  and acquired debit card transaction processing services such as authorization and settlement for acquirers 
in the merchant acquiring process flow described above  star represents a debit network 
the star network represents a telecommunications network which is connected to thousands of financial institutions  merchants  payment processors  atm processors  and card processors that participate in the network 
when one of these participants acquires a star transaction  it sends the transaction to the network switch  which is operated by the company  which in turn routes the transaction to the appropriate participant for authorization 
star s fees differ from those presented in the example above in that the debit network charges less for pin debit transactions than do the card associations for credit and signature debit since there is substantially less risk involved in the pin debit transaction because the transaction is not approved unless there are sufficient funds in the customer s bank account 
star s revenues are earned primarily on a fee per transaction basis 
in a situation in which a pin secured debit transaction uses the company s debit network and the company is the acquiring payment processor for the merchant  the company receives a fee from the merchant for acquiring the transaction  and a network acquirer fee from the merchant for accessing the network 
there are other possible configurations of transactions that result in the company receiving multiple fees for a transaction  depending on the role which the company plays 
check verification and guarantee services check verification and guarantee services use the company s proprietary database system to assist in verifying that a check writer does not have currently outstanding unpaid checks  or to guarantee that approved checks presented to merchants for payment will be collectible 
these services include risk management services  which provide software  information and analysis to assist in deposit  payment  and identity fraud prevention and reduction 
revenues are earned primarily by charging merchant fees for check verification or guarantee services 
the majority of the company s services involve providing check guarantee services for checks received by merchants 
under the guarantee service  when a merchant receives a check in payment for goods and services  the transaction is submitted to and analyzed by the company 
the company either accepts or declines the check for warranty coverage under its guarantee service 
if the company approves the check for warranty coverage and the merchant accepts the check  the merchant will deposit the check in its bank account 
if the check is returned unpaid by the merchant s bank and the returned check meets the requirements for warranty coverage  the company is required to purchase the check from the merchant at its face value 
the company then owns the purchased check and pursues collection of the check from the check writer 
as a result  the company bears the risk of loss if it is unable to collect the returned check from the check writer 
the company earns a fee for each check it guarantees  which generally is determined as a percentage of the check amount 
guarantee services also are offered utilizing the company s electronic check acceptance service eca  which converts a paper check written at the point of sale into an electronic item  enabling funds to be deposited electronically to the merchant s account and deducted electronically from the check writer s account 
under the verification service  when a merchant receives a check in payment for goods or services  the transaction is submitted to and analyzed by the company  which will either recommend the merchant accept or decline the check 
if the merchant accepts the check  the merchant will deposit the check in its bank account 
if the check is returned unpaid by the merchant s bank  the company is not required to purchase the check from the merchant and the merchant bears all risk of loss on the check 
the company earns a fee for each check submitted for verification  which is generally a fixed amount per check 
merchant services segment intellectual property fdc owns many trademarks  patents and other intellectual property that are important to its future success 
the only intellectual property right which is individually material to the company within the merchant services segment is the star trade name 
financial institutions and merchants associate the star trade name with quality and reliable debit network processing services 
loss of the proprietary use of the star trade name or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with that name could harm the company s growth in the debit network business 
most of the segments services and products are based on proprietary software that is updated to meet customer needs and remain competitive 
the company has programs to protect its proprietary software and patents as it seeks to offer distinctive services and products to customers which differentiate it from competitors 
the patent protection associated with the company s systems and software expires at different times over the next one to years 
merchant services segment competition the company s merchant services business and its alliances compete with several smaller national service providers and financial institutions that provide these services to their merchant customers 
in many cases  the merchant alliances also compete against each other for the same business 
fdc s check guarantee and verification products compete principally with the products of two other national companies 
the company also faces significant competition from regional  national and international operators of debit networks 
the most significant competitive factors relate to price  brand  strength of financial institution partnership  breadth of features and functionality  scalability and servicing capability 
the merchant services business is further impacted by large merchant and large bank consolidation  card association business model expansion  and the expansion of new payment methods and devices 
in both the merchant services and card issuing services segments  the card associations visa and mastercard are increasingly offering products and services that compete with those of the company 
as discussed more fully in item legal proceedings below  in the company counter sued visa for using its market power and rule making ability to prevent the company from competing with visa for certain network services

relevant federal privacy laws include the gramm leach bliley act  which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions  and the health insurance portability and accountability act  which applies directly to certain healthcare related businesses and indirectly to companies that provide services to such businesses

risk factors the following are certain risks that could affect the company s business and its results of operations 
the risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of the company s future operations 
acquisitions and integrating such acquisitions create certain risks and may affect operating results 
the company has been  and expects to continue to be  an active business acquirer both in the us and internationally 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks 
the core risks are in the areas of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence and integration managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company s people  products  technology and other assets so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition 
in addition  international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including  for example managing geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  complying with foreign regulatory requirements  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  difficulty entering new foreign markets due to  among other things  customer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets  and general economic and political conditions 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects of the company 
the ability to adopt technology to changing industry and customer needs or trends 
changes in technology may limit the competitiveness of and demand for the company s services 
the company s businesses operate in industries that are subject to technological advancements  developing industry standards and changing customer needs and preferences 
also  the company s customers continue to adopt new technology for business and personal uses 
the company must anticipate and respond to these industry and customer changes in order to remain competitive within its relative markets 
the ability to adopt technological advancements surrounding pos technology available to merchants could have an impact on the company s merchant services business 
likewise  within the payment services segment  the company will need to adapt to new competitors as well as new types of technology based money transfer services such as web  land and mobile phone based money transfer services  prepaid  stored value and other card based money transfer products 
the company s inability to respond to new competitors and technological advancements could impact the company s payment services business 
the spin off of western union could adversely impact the company 
the company s payment services segment primarily the western union  orlandi valuta and vigo money transfer businesses provides the company with many benefits  the absence of which could have an adverse impact on its results of operations and financial position 
risks associated with the company s decision to separate the money transfer business into an independent publicly traded company may include  but are not limited to  the following the separation may have an effect on the resulting company s debt rating depending on the resulting capital structure 
absence of western union s cash flows could subject the company to various restrictions with external lenders 
the division of the current company s board of directors and key employees may create a knowledge and skill gap 
the potential migration of investors to one company or the other may affect the resulting companies stock prices 
the spin off is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals  the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the internal revenue service and final approval by fdc s board of directors 
if the spin off does not qualify as a tax free transaction  tax could be imposed on both the company and its shareholders 
subsequent to the spin off the two independent companies could become competitors in meeting existing or new consumer needs 
certain costs will no longer be leveraged with western union s profitability and therefore could reduce margins 
current or future card association rules and practices could adversely affect the company s business  transaction volumes  operating results and financial condition 
current visa and mastercard operating rules prohibit the coexistence of competing national marks on their credit and branded debit cards 
if visa or mastercard were to determine that star is a competing national network and trade name  they could attempt to prohibit their members from issuing star branded cards and or prohibit the coexistence of the star trade name with the visa and or mastercard marks on debit and credit cards 
if this occurred  the company cannot predict whether  when forced to choose between star and other brands  issuing banks would favor star over visa or mastercard 
further  the company could lose access to the visa or mastercard network and cardholders  which could adversely affect elements of the business  such as atm transactions  personal identification number pin secured and signature debit transactions  credit card transactions  operating results and financial condition 
card issuers who participate in both star and visa or mastercard networks also may provide incentives for cardholders to use visa or mastercard signature based systems instead of the star pin based system 
such incentives may adversely affect the business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit the company s operations 
from time to time  card associations and debit networks increase the organization and or processing fees known as interchange fees that they charge 
it is possible that competitive pressures will result in the company absorbing a portion of such increases in the future  which would increase its operating costs  reduce its profit margin and adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements 
any increase in the capital level required would further limit the company s use of capital for other purposes 
maintaining the western union agent base 
maintenance of the western union agent base is key to the company s continued growth and expansion in the consumer to consumer money transfer business 
most of western union s revenue is derived through its global agent network 
existing agents grow due to increasing demand and many new agents provide western union with additional revenue from new markets 
maintaining a strong agent network is critical to success in the money transfer business 
increased agent attrition rates  fewer agents added or a combination of the two would negatively impact the current revenue and profit growth rates 
attrition may occur due to a competitor signing a western union agent to a contract  dissatisfaction of the relationship or reduced cost benefits 
in addition  agents may become less productive due to competitors being geographically close to the company s agent locations 
first data is the subject of various legal proceedings 
first data is involved in various litigation matters 
the company is also involved in or is the subject of governmental or regulatory agency inquiries or investigations from time to time 
for more information about first data s legal proceedings  see item the business may be adversely affected by risks associated with foreign operations 
the company is subject to risks related to the changes in currency rates as a result of its investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company utilizes foreign currency options  forward exchange contracts and currency swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with foreign currency denominated transactions 
however  these hedge contracts may not eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation 
the company s money transfer business is in part reliant on immigration patterns  which bring workers into countries with greater economic opportunities than they have in their native countries 
changes in immigration laws  economic development patterns that discourage international immigration  and political or other changes such as war or health emergencies that would make it more difficult for workers to immigrate could all have an adverse affect on the company s business 
increase in interest rates may negatively impact the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company may be impacted by interest rates most significantly in the following three ways interest expense is incurred on the company s billion in borrowings and its related interest rate swaps 
the effect of the swaps on much of the fixed rate debt requires the company to pay interest based on variable rates 
interest income is earned on the company s billion in settlement assets and related interest rate swaps 
the effect of the swaps on a small portion of the fixed rate investments results in the company receiving interest based on variable rates 
commissions paid to official check agents are based on short term variable interest rates on the balance of outstanding official checks and related interest rate swaps 
the effect of the swaps on the hedged portion of the commission liability requires the company to pay interest based on fixed rates 
an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on the company s results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense and commission expense the commission expense exposure is only partially hedged so an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on the unhedged portion 
the impact on interest income would not offset the potential negative impact of the interest and commission expense 
future consolidation of client financial institutions or other client groups may adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
the company has experienced the negative impact of the bank industry consolidation in recent years 
bank industry consolidation impacts existing and potential clients in fdc s service areas  primarily in card issuing services and merchant services 
the company s alliance strategy could be negatively impacted as a result of consolidations  especially where the banks involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with the company 
bank consolidation has led to an increasingly concentrated client base in the industry  resulting in a changing client mix for card issuing services as well as increased price compression 
further consolidation in the bank industry or other client base could have a negative impact on the company 
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect the company s tax expense 
the company has tax contingencies that are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
an unfavorable ruling by the taxing authorities regarding these contingencies could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the most significant of these relates to certain tax aspects of a legal restructuring of western union s international operations 
the company initiated discussions with the internal revenue service irs pursuant to the irs s advance pricing agreement apa program related to this legal restructuring 
if an apa is successfully negotiated  the company generally will avoid further examination  during the term of the apa  of the transfer pricing methods applicable to  and valuations of  the covered transactions 
the company continues to negotiate with the irs in the apa process  and while it is hopeful of reaching resolution through the process  there can be no assurances that the apa negotiations will be resolved in a manner acceptable to the company 
if not so resolved  the matter would then likely proceed to other forums within the irs 
any differences from the company s positions as recorded in its financial statements upon resolution of these issues will be reflected as a part of the income tax expense in the period during which the resolution occurs 
changes in laws  regulations and enforcement activities affecting the products  services and markets in which the company operates 
various aspects of the company s service areas are subject to us federal  state and local regulation  as well as regulation outside the united states 
failure to comply with regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of license or registration  the limitation  suspension or termination of service  and or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties  including fines which could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
as described in item  the company is subject to us and international banking regulations  a myriad of consumer protection laws  money transfer and payment instrument licensing regulation including laws intended to prevent and detect money laundering and other illicit activities  escheat regulations and privacy and information security regulations to name only a few 
changes to legal rules and regulations  or interpretation or enforcement thereof  could have a negative financial effect on the company 
in addition  even inadvertent failure of the company to comply with laws and regulations  as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness  could damage the company s reputation or brands 
the company s services are dependent on the protection of intellectual property rights and defending itself from potential patent infringement claims 
the company s trademarks  patents and other intellectual property are important to its future success 
the western union trademark and the star trade name are intellectual property rights which are individually material to the company 
the western union trademark and star trade name are widely recognized and are associated with quality and reliable service 
loss of the proprietary use of the western union trademark or the star trade name or a diminution in the perceived quality associated with these names could harm the company s growth in the money transfer or debit network business 
the company also relies on proprietary technology 
it is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology 
assurance of protecting its trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information can not be guaranteed 
the company s patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide the company with any meaningful protection or advantage 
if the company were unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies  the company could lose competitive advantages and be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company does business or contemplates doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings could prevent the company from selling its services or prevent the company from preventing others from selling competing services  and thereby have a material adverse affect on the business and results of operations 
additionally  claims have been made and other claims can be made with regards to the company s technology infringing on a patent 
unfavorable resolution of these claims could either result in the company being restricted from delivering the related service or result in a settlement that could be material to the company 
material breaches in security of the company s systems may have a significant effect on the company s business 
the uninterrupted operation of the company s information systems and the confidentiality of the customer consumer information that resides on such systems are critical to the successful operations of the company s business 
the company has security  backup and recovery systems in place  as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the system will not be inoperable 
the company also has what it deems sufficient security around the system to prevent unauthorized access to the system 
an information breach in the system and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could have a longer and more significant impact on the business operations than a hardware failure 
the loss of confidential information could result in losing the customers confidence and thus the loss of their business 
recruiting  development and succession planning 
all of the company s businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological  social  economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital 
for the company to successfully compete and grow  it must retain  recruit and develop the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of its intellectual capital needs 
in addition  the company must develop its personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital

in the counterclaim  the company alleged that visa international and visa usa  inc collectively visa  abused their market power to prevent the company from internally processing visa credit card transactions outside of the visa network through private arrangements 
the company also alleged that visa barred the company and its customers from using private arrangements to bypass the visa network  required the company s customers to pay for visa s network services regardless of whether the customers use those services  used its fee structure to raise the costs of rivals and potential rivals  imposed unreasonable conditions on rivals access to its network and deterred and prevented its members from using more efficient providers of network services such as the company 
based on this and other conduct  the counterclaim asserts claims of monopolization  attempt to monopolize  tying  unfair competition  violations of the cartwright act  defamation  trade libel  interference with prospective economic advantage  and breach of contract 
the company seeks trebled and punitive damages  attorneys fees and costs  restitution and disgorgement  and injunctive relief

on august   the court denied visa s summary judgment motion seeking to establish as a matter of law that visa is a single entity 
on december  the court heard arguments on additional motions for summary judgment filed by visa and the company 
at that hearing  visa represented that it was not asserting claims for compensatory damages against the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview first data corporation fdc or the company  with headquarters in greenwood village  colorado  operates electronic commerce and payment services businesses providing money transfer  merchant transaction processing and acquiring  and credit  retail and debit card issuing and processing services 
fdc operates in three business segments payment services  merchant services and card issuing services 
the payment services segment is comprised of businesses that provide money transfer and bill payment services to consumers and businesses whether they are from one location to another or through the issuance of an official check or money order by a bank or other institution 
the segment s consumer to consumer money transfer operations represent of the segment s revenue and provide money transfer services to people who periodically need to send funds to family and friends in other locations  or send or receive cash quickly in emergency situations 
the merchant services segment facilitates the acceptance of consumer transactions at the point of sale  whether it is transactions at a physical merchant location  over the internet  or at an atm 
merchant acquiring operations are the largest driver of the segment s revenue by facilitating the merchants ability to accept credit and debit cards by authorizing  capturing  and settling merchants credit  debit  stored value and loyalty card transactions 
a majority of these services are offered through alliance arrangements with financial institutions 
the card issuing services segment provides customer account management services to financial institutions offering branded credit cards  branded debit cards and retail private label cards to consumers and businesses 
additionally  the output services business provides print mail and embossing services to clients processing accounts on the company s platform and those using alternative platforms 
the largest drivers of revenue consist of transaction authorization and posting  network switching and account management 
to achieve its financial objectives  the company focuses on internal revenue growth  supplemented by strategic acquisitions 
internal growth is achieved through building its consumer brands  expanding and diversifying its global distribution network  and entering into new and strengthening existing alliance partner relationships 
internal growth also is driven through increased demand through growth of clients and partners 
the company has long standing relationships and long term contracts with these clients and partners 
the length of the contracts varies across the company s business units  but the majority are for multiple years 
acquisitions supplement the company s efforts to access new markets and client groups  while divestitures are done for businesses that do not complement the company s overall strategic plan 
fdc s acquisitions typically complement existing products and services  enhance the company s product lines and or expand its customer base 
the company leverages its existing brands  alliance relationships and infrastructure eg  established sales force and distribution channels  including its  worldwide money transfer agent locations and approximately million worldwide merchant locations to complement and introduce the acquired company s products to new markets  customers and geographic areas 
industry the evolution of technological capabilities is creating new competitors with innovative solutions  as well as driving an industry wide consolidation  which is creating more established competitors 
the company is involved with payment solutions technologies  such as wireless paperless products  stored value cards and other custom payment solutions 
these technologies will continue to be significant factors when considering the growth of the company with respect to the continued conversion from paper processing to electronic transaction processing 
the company expects that the shift from cash and check transactions to electronic and card transactions will continue to create growth opportunities 
bank industry consolidation impacts existing and potential clients in fdc s service areas  primarily in card issuing services and merchant services 
the company s alliance strategy could be impacted negatively as a result of consolidations  especially where the banks involved are committed to merchant processing businesses that compete with the company 
conversely  if an existing alliance bank partner acquires a new merchant business this could result in such business being contributed to the alliance 
bank consolidation has led to an increasingly concentrated client base in the industry  resulting in a changing client mix for card issuing services as well as increased price compression 
financial summary significant financial and other measures for the full year ended december  include total revenues increased from with payment services segment revenue growing and merchant services segment revenue growing 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased  most significantly attributable to the gain on sale of gca 
cash flows from operating activities decreased to  million  and the company received proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt 
during the company disbursed million for business and portfolio acquisitions and  million to repurchase the company s shares 
the money transfer agent network increased to over  locations including  vigo locations  and consumer to consumer money transfer transactions increased to million 
north america merchant transactions increased to billion 
north america issuer transactions increased to billion

the transaction closed on january   resulting in ownership of the alliance to be accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules a f and d f under the securities and exchange act of as allowed by the sec  the company s policy is to not include in management s assessment of internal controls the internal controls of acquired companies in the year of acquisition if the company deems that an assessment could not be adequately accomplished in the normal course of business 
all acquisitions noted above that closed in were not within the scope of management s report on internal controls over financial reporting 
the company does not deem these acquisitions significant  individually or in aggregate  to the consolidated financial statements 
spin off of western union on january  the company announced its intention to separate the western union money transfer business into an independent publicly traded company through a spin off of of western union to fdc shareholders 
the spin off is intended to be tax free to the shareholders and completion is expected in the second half of at this point the company has not made any decisions regarding its capital structure or other significant matters 
the spin off is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals  the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the internal revenue service and final approval by fdc s board of directors 
upon completion of the spin off the shareholders will have separate ownership interests in fdc and western union 
western union will consist of fdc s consumer to consumer and consumer to business money transfer businesses including the western union  vigo and orlandi valuta brands  and related businesses 
fdc and western union will each be independent and have separate public ownership  boards of directors and management 
to facilitate western union s separation from fdc  the companies will continue certain existing arrangements during a transition period following completion of the spin off 
the company will incur incremental costs to effect the spin off 
these costs will be included in operating expenses 
the company will identify and disclose these amounts each period through the date of the spin off 
this report describes fdc as structured and operated in management and segment reorganization in november  charles t 
fote  the chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board of directors of fdc  retired 
henry c 
duques was named the company s chief executive officer in november and became the chairman of the board of directors on january  in connection with this change in leadership  changes were made to the company s senior management and organization of the business 
also  significant restructuring actions and their related charges were undertaken prior to the end of beginning in  the chief operating decision maker will make strategic and operating decisions with regards to assessing performance and allocating resources based on a new segment structure 
a summary of how the segments will be structured follows segment description western union consumer to consumer money transfer businesses and consumer to business money transfer businesses the western union segment will represent most of the businesses that will be part of the spin off noted above first data commercial services domestic merchant acquiring and processing  debit network acquiring and processing  check verification and guarantee  and prepaid first data financial institution services domestic customer account management  transaction processing and remittance services for credit  retail and debit accounts  and output services first data international international credit  debit and prepaid card processing  atm and pos processing  driving  acquiring and switching integrated payment systems official check business the discussion below addresses the operations of the company based on how the company was operated in  which is consistent with prior years 
the above noted structure was effective january  segment discussion payment services segment payment services  which primarily is comprised of western union money transfer  continues to focus on international growth by expanding and diversifying its global distribution network  building the brand and enhancing the consumer experience  and leveraging channels and diversifying product offerings 
the company believes that near and long term growth potential will come from the expansion of agent locations  continued growth of the global remittance market  the global loyalty program and alternative distribution points such as westernunion 
com 
vigo remittance corp  acquired in october  is included in the payment services segment 
in the first quarter  western union signed an agreement to continue its business with grupo elektra 
the majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations as new agent locations contribute only marginally to revenue growth in the first few years of their operation 
increased productivity  measured by transactions per location  often is experienced as locations mature  with agents becoming very productive after five years 
the company believes that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money 
however  the number of send and pay transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location  immigration patterns  the location s class of trade and hours of operation  length of time the location has been offering western union services  regulatory limitations and competition 
western union continues to experience vigorous competition in the traditional money transfer and bill payment businesses and is encountering expanded competition from banks  atm providers and card associations as well as traditional service providers  informal payment networks  web  telephone payment systems including mobile phone and card based service providers  as well as overnight mail and courier services 
to effectively compete with these new channels western union is developing various service enhancements and new product offerings in response to the evolving competitive landscape  including consumer to bank account payout  prepaid services  expansion of on line services and telephone and card based options 
western union s money transfer business to  from  or within a country may be affected by a number of political  regulatory compliance and economic factors 
from time to time  transactions within or between countries may be limited or prohibited by law 
additionally  economic or political instability may make money transfers to  from  or within a particular country difficult  as when banks are closed  devaluation of the currency makes it difficult to manage exchange rates or civil unrest makes access to western union agent locations unsafe 
emigration patterns  new regulations  changing economic conditions  the geo political environment  natural disasters  competition and other factors can impact both transactions and revenues 
the company s money transfer and bill payment service businesses are subject to regulation in the us by the federal government and most of the states 
in addition  the money transfer business is subject to some form of regulation in each of the more than countries and territories in which such services are offered 
the company has developed compliance programs to monitor regulatory requirements and developments and to implement policies and procedures to help satisfy these requirements 
it is important to recognize  however  that the company s money transfer network operates through independent agents in most countries and the company s ability to control the compliance activities of such agents is limited 
the company continues to enhance compliance programs focused on agent training and monitoring to help satisfy legal and regulatory compliance by its agents 
the number and complexity of regulations around the world and the pace at which such regulation is changing  poses a significant challenge to the company s money transfer business 
a violation of law may result in civil or criminal penalties or a prohibition against a money transmitter and or its agents from providing money transfer services in a particular jurisdiction 
in recent years federal and certain state regulatory departments have alleged deficiencies with respect to western union s transaction reporting and compliance programs 
western union has reached agreements with such regulatory departments without admission of wrongdoing 
the us department of treasury has required that money transmitters conduct due diligence and risk based monitoring of their agents 
the company continues to enhance its regulatory compliance activities to address the requirements of domestic and international regulations 
these additional efforts increase the company s costs of doing business 
the company believes that the trend toward additional regulation will continue and that the company s compliance with worldwide regulation may provide a competitive advantage in the future 
merchant services segment merchant services continues to expand its position in the credit  signature debit and pin debit processing markets through the strength of the alliance partners  focused sales force efforts and the development of new point of sale pos technologies and payment methods 
the company continues to expand its merchant alliance program and  as of december   there were in excess of participating financial institutions worldwide in the alliance program with the addition of partners in as noted above  during the company formed alliances by acquiring certain assets with ics  bankwest and citibank and acquired epi  apss and kmps which provide a presence in the netherlands  norway  slovakia  latvia  lithuania  australia  austria and korea 
the card issuing related portion of the operating results of epi and apss are reflected in the card issuing services segment 
in connection with the concord efs inc concord merger  the company estimated the impact of anticipated terminated contracts at approximately million of concord s historic annualized revenue  and as of december   all clients related to such contracts had deconverted 
the contract terminations impact both the merchant services and card issuing services segments 
in july  jpmorgan chase part owner of the company s chase merchant services alliance merged with bank one part owner of the company s paymentech alliance 
in october  the company and jpmorgan chase signed an agreement to integrate the operations of chase merchant services and paymentech  under the name of chase paymentech solutions  llc cps 
the integration agreement calls for a processing contract between the company and cps  which is being negotiated 
the processing contract will run for the duration of the alliance 
oversight will be provided through a board on which the owners will be equally represented 
the alliance will continue to be accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in december  the company sold of the pnc merchant services alliance of its interest to the pnc financial services group  its partner in the alliance 
upon closing of the agreement the company owned of the alliance and began accounting for it under the equity method of accounting 
revenues and expense have been retroactively adjusted back to january  to reflect the alliance as an investment accounted for under the equity method 
there have been developing trends in the competitive landscape whereby card associations are expanding their business models 
visa is emerging as a more direct competitor as it expands its suite of service offerings to merchants and financial institutions while continuing its role in the settlement of visa transactions and its ownership of the interlink branded debit network 
such services may result in visa significantly expanding its presence in the merchant acquiring market 
merchant services segment revenues are driven largely by the number of transactions and to a lesser degree  dollar volumes  therefore  this segment is the company s segment which is least insulated from economic slowdowns 
consumers continue to increase the use of credit  debit and stored value cards in place of cash and checks  with the decrease in use of checks negatively affecting the company s check verification and guarantee business 
the company expects that if  for example  consumer spending increases in correlation to an improved economy  the company will experience a relatively proportionate increase in transactions 
internet payments  although fast growing  continue to account for a small portion of the segment s transactions 
while transactions over the internet may involve increased risk  these transactions typically generate higher profits for the company 
the company continues to enhance its fraud detection and other systems to address such risks 
the company experienced growth in the pin debit market in that exceeded the growth in the credit market and the company expects this growth trend to continue 
trends in consumer spending between national  regional and boutique merchants impact revenue and operating margins as revenue per transaction and operating margins from national merchants are typically less than regional and boutique merchants 
the segment has historically experienced three to five percent annual price compression on average domestically  with price compression for the national merchants being higher 
as consumers shift spending to national merchants and the company experiences additional competition for national merchant contracts  results of operations could be negatively impacted if increased transaction volume is not sufficient to compensate for the lower pricing 
the company currently mitigates this impact through a diverse mix of national  regional and boutique merchants as well as expense reductions and enhanced product offerings 
financial results of the merchant alliance strategy appear both in the transaction and processing service fee revenue and equity earnings in affiliates line items of the consolidated statements of income 
as a result of this accounting treatment  the effect of a merchant moving from an unconsolidated alliance to a consolidated entity would result in the reduction of processing revenue and equity earnings  which would be more than offset by a larger increase in acquiring revenue 
the opposite would occur with a merchant moving from a consolidated entity to an unconsolidated alliance 
such movement of merchants may have a minimal impact on net income in an instance where the unconsolidated alliance is owned by the company and the consolidated entity is owned ie only a difference when considering minority interest expense 
although the net income impact in this instance may be minimal the revenue impact could be significant 
the revenue impact would be further amplified by merchants that are mostly pin debit as there would be significant impact to debit network fee revenue and no impact to net income as these fees have no margin 
the purchase and sale of merchant contracts is an ordinary element of the company s merchant services business  as is the movement of merchant contracts between the company and its merchant alliances 
the company periodically evaluates merchant portfolios  both branded and unbranded  and which the company has been unable to distribute to the company s alliance partners 
the company or a merchant alliance may purchase or sell a portfolio of contracts outright 
other times a partner may purchase the company s interest in a merchant alliance 
this gives the partner ownership in the underlying merchant contracts as compared to a partial interest in a joint venture alliance that owns the contracts 
other times the formation of a merchant alliance involves the sale of an interest in a portfolio of the company s merchant contracts to the joint venture partner for cash 
management considers these transactions to be in the ordinary course of managing the company s business  and therefore  the gains from selling these revenue generating assets are included within the product sales and other component of revenues 
since the completion of its merger with concord on february   the company has executed numerous initiatives to integrate concord into fdc and reorganize existing fdc operations 
the company identified expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to integration and reorganization efforts which were recorded in the cost of services  selling  general and administrative  restructuring and impairments line items of the consolidated statements of income 
approximately and of these expenses were incurred in the merchant services segment  which does not include restructuring and impairments  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses included the cost of personnel who were assigned to work exclusively on the integration or reorganization  as well as a portion of the personnel costs for those who were partially dedicated to such efforts 
integration and reorganization expenses also included certain internal and contract system development costs and infrastructure costs 
card issuing services segment in november  the company announced it was performing an operational review of the credit  retail  and output services businesses in the card issuing services segment in response to changes in the business environment and the change in the mix of these businesses over the last several years 
the company concluded that review and determined that these businesses are an integral part of its operations 
however  due to the changing environment and direction of these businesses  the company took significant actions in the fourth quarter including the announced closing of two output services facilities and the termination of employees around the world associated with these businesses 
the company will continue to evaluate process improvements to reduce costs in and card issuing services continues to focus on converting its account pipeline  maximizing productivity and system capacity  growing through expansion into adjacent markets such as healthcare and making selective acquisitions 
during  the company acquired epi and apss which provided a presence in norway  slovakia  latvia  lithuania and austria 
the merchant related portion of the operating results of epi and apss are reflected in the merchant services segment 
in connection with the concord merger  the company estimated the impact of anticipated terminated contracts at approximately million of concord s historic annualized revenue  and as of december   all clients related to such contracts had deconverted 
the contract terminations impact both the merchant services and card issuing services segments 
in june  the card issuing services segment signed a long term processing agreement with citibank that will expand the company s existing relationship to include processing services for the sears  roebuck co 
card portfolios 
the extended relationship will focus on private label and private label co branded bankcards in addition to the accounts currently processed for citibank 
the sears co branded bankcard and private label portfolios are expected to convert in the second quarter of the bank consolidation noted above was a contributing factor to the termination and deconversion of several significant credit card processing contracts including fleetboston  hsbc and jpmorgan chase 
the underlying economic drivers of card issuance are population demographics and employment 
new cardholders are predominantly people aged  a demographic segment that has been growing at a faster pace than the general population in recent years 
strengthening in the economy typically results in an improved credit risk profile  allowing card issuers to be more aggressive in their marketing campaigns to issue more cards 
the company continues to see a shift to the use of pin debit cards from credit  signature debit  checks and cash 
pin debit transactions have been the fastest growing type of transaction 
in january  the company received notice that bank of america will terminate its output services and remittance processing agreements with the company in the second half of also wells fargo bank notified the company of its intent to begin in house processing of a portion of their debit card portfolios beginning in the second half of the collective impact of these two events is expected to adversely impact card issuing services segment revenue by less than in and less than on an annualized basis 
all other and corporate in june  simpay limited  the only client of first data mobile payments limited formerly encorus payments limited  announced and executed a plan to cease operations 
as a result  the simpay structure supporting interoperable mobile payments will not be launched as planned 
based on these developments and the completion of a strategic review in august  the company significantly reduced the scale of its associated operations 
these actions and the reduced business outlook led the company to record restructuring and asset impairment charges of approximately million in the third and fourth quarters of the company continues to assess the business opportunities around the first data mobile payments technologies and certain employees continue to develop and sell its solutions 
since the business continues to be a going concern certain assets and the cumulative translation adjustment in equity remain on the balance sheet 
additionally  a valuation allowance has been recorded on the deferred tax asset related to the first data mobile payments loss on impairment of intangible assets because the likelihood of realizing the future tax benefit is not considered more likely than not at this point in time 
both the cumulative translation adjustment and the tax benefit associated with the impairment of intangible assets could be recognized in a future period if the business were to be shutdown in its entirety 
in connection with the formation of the fdgs holdings  lp fdgs formerly eone global  l 
p partnership in november  the company agreed to contribute up to million to fdgs in the event that its contract was renewed on terms materially worse than the contract in effect at the time of formation  and have a material adverse effect on the business of fdgs  subject to certain limitations 
during the third quarter fdgs extended its contract with bank of america  and in the fourth quarter  the company agreed to contribute million to fdgs  its owned subsidiary which the parties agree satisfies the initially agreed to contribution required related to that contract renewal 
the contribution resulted in a reduction in equity of approximately million 
in august  the company sold its remaining interest in international banking technologies  which was substantially divested in results for include a pretax gain of approximately million from the sale 
discontinued operations the july  sale agreement between nyce and metavante corporation contemplated potential adjustments to the sales price that became estimable in the fourth quarter the estimated adjustment to the sales price of million was recorded in the fourth quarter and is presented in discontinued operations  net of a sale reserve and taxes  on the consolidated statements of income 
components of revenue and expenses the following briefly describes the components of operating revenue and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income

acquiring revenue grew in compared to due mostly to the inclusion of concord s merchant acquiring business from the date of the merger 
the spread between the transaction growth rate and revenue growth rate is caused primarily by the mix of merchants 
most of the disparity is within the segment s portfolios of national merchants which drive significant transaction growth and experience the most price compression 
the segment has historically experienced three to five percent annual price compression on average domestically  with price compression for the national merchants being higher 
merchant pin debit transactions  including fdc acquired and star network transactions  have historically been the fastest growing type of transaction accounting for approximately  and of total north america merchant transactions for the years ended december    and  respectively 
much of the increase in pin debit transactions in was due to the concord merger 
despite the historical trend of being the fastest growing type of transaction  the company s growth rate for pin debit transactions slowed in due to a national merchant routing a portion of its debit transactions directly to a network provider as well as star client deconversions anticipated in the merger with concord 
the recent development of routing transactions directly to network providers benefited the company as the star debit network was the beneficiary of these types of transactions

the integration of chase merchant services and paymentech in resulted in certain costs being incurred by the alliance  including restructuring type costs  and certain synergies being realized from the consolidation of administrative and other functions

the shift from credit to retail and debit cards continues  as shown below  as the jpmorgan chase accounts deconverted in july were credit accounts 
retail account portfolios typically have a lower proportionate share of active accounts than credit account portfolios and product usage is different between the card types resulting in lower revenue per account 
in addition  contract pricing at the customer level is dependent upon the mix of accounts ie retail private label  private label co brand  debit and credit  volume of accounts  transaction volume and product usage

in addition to the renewal option  the company also has the option of purchasing the related property for the lease balance or remarketing the property for the lessor at the end of the initial and any renewal term 
the company has guaranteed the value realizable from the sale of the property at the end of the lease term 
the company is responsible for the difference between the assumed net sale proceeds for the memphis facility and the total costs financed  which exceeds the guarantee value of approximately million 
at december   the company had a million liability assumed in the purchase business combination related to the excess of the total cost financed and other carrying costs over the assumed net sale proceeds 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations a technology and telecommunications b all other c other long term liabilities does not include guaranteed residual value of million associated with synthetic operating leases 
a many of the company s contracts contain clauses that allow the company to terminate the contract with notice  and with or without a termination penalty 
termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation 
certain contracts also have an automatic renewal clause if the company does not provide written notification of its intent to terminate the contract 
obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are  therefore  estimated in the above amounts 
historically  the company has not had any significant defaults of its contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of its contractual obligations 
b technology and telecommunications includes obligations related to hardware purchases  software licenses  hardware and software maintenance and support  technical consulting services and telecommunications services 
c other includes obligations related to materials and data used in the card issuing services segment  non technical contract services  facility security and maintenance and marketing promotions 
critical accounting policies reserve for merchant credit losses and check guarantees with respect to the merchant acquiring business  the company s merchant customers or those of its unconsolidated alliances have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
in the event  however  that the company is not able to collect such amounts from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or another reason  the company may be liable for any such reversed charges 
the company s risk in this area primarily relates to situations where the cardholder has purchased goods or services to be delivered in the future such as airline tickets 
the company s obligation to stand ready to perform is minimal in relation to the total dollar volume processed 
the company requires cash deposits  guarantees  letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants to minimize its obligation 
collateral held by the company is classified within settlement obligations on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts of collateral held by the company and its unconsolidated alliances are as follows in millions year ended december  cash and cash equivalents collateral collateral in the form of letters of credit total collateral the company also utilizes a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk 
despite these efforts  the company historically has experienced some level of losses due to merchant defaults 
the company s contingent obligation relates to imprecision in its estimates of required collateral 
a provision for this obligation is recorded based primarily on historical experience of credit losses and other relevant factors such as economic downturns or increases in merchant fraud 
merchant credit losses are included in cost of services in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the following table presents the aggregate merchant credit losses incurred compared to total dollar volumes processed year ended december  fdc and unconsolidated alliances credit losses in millions fdc and consolidated alliances credit losses in millions total dollar volume processed in billions the reserve recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets only relates to the business conducted by its consolidated subsidiaries 
the reserve for unconsolidated alliances is recorded only in the alliances respective financial statements 
the company has not recorded any reserve for estimated losses in excess of reserves recorded by the unconsolidated alliances nor has the company identified needs to do so 
at december  and  the company and its consolidated and unconsolidated alliances had aggregate merchant credit loss reserves of million and million  respectively 
the foregoing disclosure presents merchant credit loss reserves in the aggregate without regard to whether the reserves relate to merchant contracts held by entities consolidated by the company or alliances accounted for under the equity method 
the amount of the reserves attributable to entities consolidated by the company was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company believes the recorded reserve approximates the fair value of the contingent obligation 
the credit loss reserves  both for the unconsolidated alliances and the company  are comprised of amounts for known losses and a provision for losses incurred but not reported ibnr 
these reserves primarily are determined by performing a historical analysis of chargeback loss experience 
other factors are considered that could affect that experience in the future 
such items include the general economy and economic challenges in a specific industry or those affecting certain types of clients 
once these factors are considered  the company or the unconsolidated alliance establishes a rate percentage that is calculated by dividing the expected chargeback credit losses by dollar volume processed 
this rate is then applied against the dollar volume processed each month and charged against earnings 
the resulting reserve balance is then compared to requirements for known losses and estimates for ibnr items 
historically  this estimation process has proven to be materially accurate and the company believes the recorded reserve approximates the fair value of the contingent obligation 
the majority of the telecheck business involves the guarantee of checks received by merchants 
if the check is returned  telecheck is required to purchase the check from the merchant at its face value and pursue collection from the check writer 
a provision for estimated check returns  net of anticipated recoveries  is recorded at the transaction inception based on recent history 
at december  and  the company had accrued warranty balances of million and million  and accrued recovery balances of million and million  respectively 
accrued warranties are included in accounts payable and other liabilities and accrued recoveries are included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
during  the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
under fin  the company established an incremental liability and deferred revenue for the fair value of the check guarantee 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized when the check clears  is presented to telecheck  or the guarantee period expires 
the majority of the guarantees are settled within days 
an incremental liability of million was recorded during the first quarter of and its balance was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the aggregate face value of all checks guaranteed during the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  were returned to merchants and presented to telecheck 
the net impact on operating income from warranty losses  net of recoveries from check writers was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the maximum potential future payments under the guarantees were estimated by the company to be approximately billion at december  derivative financial instruments the company presently uses derivative instruments to mitigate cash flow risks with respect to forecasted transactions commission payments and changes in foreign currency transactions denominated in foreign currency rates 
furthermore  the company uses derivative instruments to mitigate fair value risk related to changes in interest rates long term investments and fixed rate long term debt 
the company also uses derivative instruments to protect the initial net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries and or affiliates 
as required  such instruments are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting other than certain short term foreign currency forward contracts 
the company does not participate in speculative derivative trading 
while the company expects that its derivative instruments will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if the company did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
the company does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its hedging activities  as the counter parties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
capitalized costs fdc capitalizes initial payments for new contracts  contract renewals and conversion costs associated with customer contracts and system development costs 
capitalization of such costs is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization 
capitalization of initial payments for contracts and conversion costs only occurs when management is satisfied that such costs are recoverable through future operations  contractual minimums and or penalties in case of early termination 
the company develops software that is used in providing processing services to customers 
to a lesser extent  the company also develops software to be sold or licensed to customers 
capitalization of internally developed software  primarily associated with operating platforms  occurs only upon management s estimation that the likelihood of successful development and implementation reaches a probable level 
currently unforeseen circumstances in software development could require the company to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort  which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs 
the company s accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated ongoing future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees the company would receive in the event of early termination of the contract by the customer 
the company s entitlement to termination fees may  however  be subject to challenge if a customer were to allege that the company was in breach of contract 
this entitlement is also subject to the customer s ability to pay 
the company had aggregate net book values for initial payments for contracts  conversion costs and software development of million  million and million  respectively  at december  and million  million and million  respectively  at december  investment securities the company has investments in the equity securities of both public and private companies where it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee s business 
investments in public companies and certain investment partnerships are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with changes in fair value recorded through the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity or for investment partnerships through investment income 
investments in private companies are recorded at cost 
in the case of either investment type  declines in the fair value of the investments are reviewed to determine whether they are other than temporary in nature 
declines in value that are judged to be other than temporary in nature are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
for public company investments  absent any other indications of a decline in value being other than temporary in nature  the company s policy is to treat a decline in the investment s quoted market value that has lasted for more than six months as an other than temporary decline in value 
the company s policy is the same for private company investments  however  their fair values are estimated 
in estimating fair value  the company considers market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings losses  price multiples  financial position  new financing and other key measures 
the company believes its estimates result in a reasonable reflection of the fair values of these investments 
the company maintains various other investments many of which are classified as available for sale and carried at fair market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company also has investments in non marketable equity securities and other investments that are carried at cost of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these investments are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses are classified within the investment gains and losses caption in the consolidated statements of income 
transactions with related parties as defined by sfas no 
a substantial portion of the company s business within the merchant services segment is conducted through merchant alliances 
certain merchant alliances  as it pertains to investments accounted for under the equity method  are joint ventures between the company and financial institutions 
no directors or officers of the company have ownership interests in any of the alliances 
the formation of each of these alliances generally involves the company and the bank contributing contractual merchant relationships to the alliance and a cash payment from one owner to the other to achieve the desired ownership percentage for each 
the company and the bank contract a long term processing service agreement as part of the negotiation process 
this agreement governs the company s provision of transaction processing services to the alliance 
therefore  the company has two income streams from these alliances its share of the alliance s net income classified as equity earnings in affiliates and the processing fees it charges to the alliance classified as transaction processing and service fees 
the processing fees are based on transaction volumes and unit pricing as contained in the processing services agreement negotiated with the alliance partner 
if the company has majority ownership and management control over an alliance  then the alliance s financial statements are consolidated with those of the company and the related processing fees are treated as an intercompany transaction and eliminated upon consolidation 
if the company does not have a controlling ownership interest in an alliance  it uses the equity method of accounting to account for its investment in the alliance 
as a result  the company s consolidated revenues include processing fees charged to alliances accounted for under the equity method 
the company negotiated all agreements with the alliance banks 
therefore  all transactions between the company and its alliances were conducted at arm s length 
however  sfas no 
 related party disclosures  defines a transaction between the company and an entity for which investments are accounted for under the equity method by the company as a related party transaction requiring separate disclosure in the financial statements provided by the company 
the revenue associated with these related party transactions are presented on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
the company has investments in investment funds managed by a member of the board of directors 
the company also pays an annual management fee to the fund 
such investment was made with the approval of the board and is of such amount that is not considered material to the company 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values over the corresponding service period and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense 
the company adopted sfas r following the modified prospective method effective january  as permitted by sfas  during the company followed apb opinion no 
which accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r fair value method will have an estimated eps impact of approximately on the company s results of operations assuming a certain level of awards 
variation to the assumed level of awards and other factors could result in a different amount 
had the company adopted sfas  the impact on diluted eps would have been  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in is due to the accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options granted by the company to its officers and its employees under the company s long term incentive plan 
certain of the company s employee share based compensation awards have terms that provide for vesting to continue after retirement 
the company historically has accounted for this type of arrangement by recognizing pro forma compensation cost over the stated vesting period for the sfas pro forma disclosures 
upon adoption of sfas r  compensation cost will be recognized over a shorter period that ends with retirement eligibility for awards granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas r while grants occurring before adoption of sfas r will be expensed under a methodology consistent with the company s historical practice of expensing over the stated vesting period 
the impact of applying statement r requirements for accelerated expense recognition noted above compared to the company s current methodology of expensing over the stated vesting period would have impacted pro forma sfas compensation expense  net of tax  by a million benefit for  and expenses of million and million for and  respectively 
forward looking statements after the western union spin off is completed  annual revenue and earnings per share growth over the long term for the new first data is expected to be in the range of  and annual revenue and profit growth for western union is expected to be in the mid teens 
for the combined company  the company expects to deliver earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of to for  which includes an estimated impact from expensing share based awards as required by sfas r 
this guidance does not include the costs that will be incurred in the western union spin off 
in connection with the company s earnings per share projection for  management of the company undertakes to update the projection at any time management has determined that the projection is materially inaccurate 
the company does not undertake to update  and does not intend to comment on  segment level projections during the year 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
important factors upon which the company s forward looking statements are premised include a no unanticipated developments that delay or negatively impact the planned tax free spin off of of the western union subsidiary to the company s shareholders  b continued growth at rates approximating recent levels for card based payment transactions  consumer money transfer transactions and other product markets  c successful conversions under service contracts with major clients  d renewal of material contracts in the company s business units consistent with past experience  e timely  successful and cost effective implementation of processing systems to provide new products  improved functionality and increased efficiencies  f successful and timely integration of significant businesses and technologies acquired by the company and realization of anticipated synergies  g continuing development and maintenance of appropriate business continuity plans for the company s processing systems based on the needs and risks relative to each such system  h absence of further consolidation among client financial institutions or other client groups which has a significant impact on fdc client relationships and no material loss of business from significant customers of the company  i achieving planned revenue growth throughout the company  including in the merchant alliance program which involves several joint ventures not under the sole control of the company and each of which acts independently of the others  and successful management of price compression through cost efficiencies and other cost management initiatives  j successfully managing the credit and fraud risks in the company s business units and the merchant alliances  particularly in the context of the developing e commerce markets  k anticipation of and response to technological changes  particularly with respect to e commerce  l attracting and retaining qualified key employees  m no unanticipated changes in laws  regulations  debit network and credit card association rules or other industry standards affecting the company s businesses which require significant product redevelopment efforts  reduce the market for or value of its products or render products obsolete  n continuation of the existing interest rate environment so as to avoid increases in agent fees related to ips products and increases in interest on the company s borrowings  o absence of significant changes in foreign exchange spreads on retail money transfer transactions  particularly in high volume corridors  without a corresponding increase in volume or consumer fees  p continued political stability in countries in which western union has material operations  q implementation of western union agent agreements with governmental entities according to schedule and no interruption of relations with countries in which western union has or is implementing material agent agreements  r no unanticipated developments relating to previously disclosed lawsuits  investigations or similar matters  s no catastrophic events that could impact the company s or its major customer s operating facilities  communication systems and technology or that has a material negative impact on current economic conditions or levels of consumer spending  t no material breach of security of any of our systems  and u successfully managing the potential both for patent protection and patent liability in the context of rapidly developing legal framework for expansive software patent protection 
variations from these assumptions or failure to achieve these objectives could cause actual results to differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
due to the uncertainties inherent in forward looking statements  readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company s assets include both fixed and floating rate interest bearing securities 
these investments arise primarily from the company s sale of payment instruments principally official checks and money orders 
the company invests the proceeds from the sale of these instruments  pending the settlement of the payment instrument obligation 
the company has classified these investments as available for sale 
accordingly  they are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheets at fair market value 
a portion of the company s payment services business involves the payment of commissions to selling agents that are computed based on short term variable rates 
to the extent the company does not pay commissions to its selling agents  or to the extent it invests the proceeds from the sale of payment instruments in floating rate investments  interest rate risk is nonexistent or minimal providing the investments are held to maturity 
the unmatched position that is not hedged through interest rate swap derivatives  which is the amount of fixed income investments upon which the company also pays the selling agent a commission based on short term interest rates  is the amount that subjects the company to interest rate risk arising from changes in short term interest rates 
the company s objective in managing interest rate risk is to mitigate the risk that earnings and the market value of the investments could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company has developed a risk management program to quantify this risk utilizing advanced portfolio modeling techniques 
the company has hedged a majority of this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements  which converts the variable rate commission payments to a fixed rate and to a lesser extent the impact of market valuation of certain long term investments 
the company s interest rate sensitive liabilities are its debt instruments consisting of commercial paper  fixed rate medium term notes and long term debt securities 
a proportionate increase in interest rates in  as compared with the average level of interest rates in  would result in a decrease to pretax income of approximately million 
of this decrease  million based on the increase noted above which equates to a basis point increase in the three month t bill rate relates to expected investment positions  commissions paid to selling agents  growth in new business and the effects of swap agreements 
the remaining million based on the increase noted above which equates to a basis point increase in interest rates decrease primarily relates to the company s expected balance of short term variable rate commercial paper and variable interest rate debt 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable improvement to pretax earnings 
actual interest rates could change significantly more than 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
foreign currency risk the company is exposed to changes in currency rates as a result of its investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar 
a risk management program is in place to manage these risks  the majority of which is related to western union s foreign currency denominated revenue 
western union provides money transfer services in more than countries and territories 
foreign exchange risk is managed through the structure of the business and an active risk management process 
western union settles with its agents in us dollars or euros and in certain circumstances in the agents respective local currencies and requires the agent to obtain settlement currency to provide to recipients 
thus  western union generally is not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid shortly after they are initiated 
in addition  in money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies  western union generates revenue by receiving a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and providing the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
this spread provides some protection against currency fluctuations 
western union s policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies and it promptly buys and sells foreign currencies as necessary to cover its net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies 
the company utilizes foreign currency options  forward exchange contracts and currency swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with foreign currency denominated transactions primarily related to the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and australian dollar 
these are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted sales expected to occur over the next five years 
gains and losses on the derivatives are intended to offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions in an effort to reduce the earnings volatility resulting from fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
since the critical terms of the options  forward and swap contracts  and the hedged transactions are the same  the hedges are highly effective 
changes in the fair value of the options and forward contracts designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with foreign currency risk are generally reported in the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
these amounts subsequently are reclassified into revenue or expense in the same period in which the foreign currency transactions occur 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings as are changes in fair value of the hedged item 
as of december   the maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows associated with foreign currency risk is five years for revenues  although over of the aggregate derivative notional amount expires within one year 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to all the currencies in which the company s revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to pretax income of approximately million 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
regulatory western union s international agents have the responsibility to maintain all licenses necessary to provide money transfer services in their countries and to comply with all local rules  regulations and licensing requirements 
the company s money transfer business is subject to some form of regulation in each of the countries and territories in which such services are offered 
in some countries  only fully licensed banks and the national post office are permitted to provide cross border money transfer service to the general public 
state  federal and foreign jurisdictions may impose regulations that could impact western union s foreign exchange risk by  among other possibilities  imposing regulations that limit western union s ability to obtain the benefit of the exchange rate spread between wholesale and retail currency rates or imposing banking moratoriums or other actions that could affect currency liquidity 
western union has successfully managed the risks outlined above in the past and believes that the breadth and scope of its network makes it unlikely that these risks will have a material adverse impact on its business 
in those few countries with significant foreign currency controls  western union offers inbound only service and does not accept funds in these countries for remittance abroad 
banking moratoriums have been very rare and  to date  they have not had an appreciable impact on western union s business 
when such a moratorium is imposed by a country  the company may temporarily discontinue its services in that country 
through its merchant alliances  the merchant services segment holds an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as the electronic processor for those businesses 
in order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements  the company actively maintains an antitrust compliance program
