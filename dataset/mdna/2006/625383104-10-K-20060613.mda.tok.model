critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
the company continually evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories and any related reserves  income taxes  fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies impact the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the company s senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the board of directors audit and finance committee 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the decorating solutions segment recognizes revenue on sales of products when the customer receives title to the goods  which is generally upon shipment or delivery depending on sales terms 
the packaging services segment recognizes revenue upon completion of the service provided to the customer or in certain circumstances  when the customer receives title to the goods upon shipment 
all revenues are denominated in us dollars and net of applicable returns and discounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of fifo first in  first out cost or market 
excess and obsolete cost reductions are generally established based on inventory age 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily major consumer product companies and container manufacturers 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific individual risks identified 
losses may also depend to some degree on future economic conditions 
although these conditions are unknown to us and may result in additional credit losses  we do not anticipate significant adverse credit circumstances in fiscal if we are unable to collect all or part of the outstanding receivable balance  there could be a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test is completed based upon our assessment of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
for purposes of these tests  we have determined that each segment of multi color is one reporting unit 
the annual review for impairment of goodwill requires the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe are appropriate 
application of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred involves various estimates and assumptions  including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review 
the cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience  adjusted to reflect estimated future market and operating conditions 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value 
we base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available  independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge 
changes in the market condition and or losses of a production line could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis and reported book basis of assets and liabilities and result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
future changes in regulatory tax laws and or different positions held by taxing authorities may affect the value recorded for income and deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from operating activities in were  an increase of  compared to the  provided by operating activities in the increase resulted from an increase in earnings and favorable changes in working capital  consisting of reduced accounts receivable  increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by increased inventories and prepaid expenses

capital expenditures in related to various machinery and equipment for our printing plants and a new warehouse management system for the packaging services segment 
capital expenditures in related primarily to a new gravure press in our scottsburg  in plant and a new business information system 
we actively seek to identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates and  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions of businesses 
any acquisitions may require us to issue additional equity or incur additional debt 
at march   we had capitalized approximately  related to a potential acquisition 
completion of potential acquisitions may or may not occur 
we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of lenders consisting of a revolving line of credit revolver  a non revolving line of credit non revolver  a swing line note swing line and a term note

there were no outstanding borrowings under the swing line at march  under the terms of the credit facility agreement  we are subject to several financial covenants 
the financial covenants require us to maintain certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as well as maintain a minimum net worth 
our credit agreement allows us to pay dividends up to  in any given year 
a quarterly cash dividend of five cents per share was paid during fiscal and totaled  the credit agreement expires august  available borrowings under the credit facility at march  consisted of  under the revolver and  under the swing line 

table of contents we believe that we have both sufficient short and long term liquidity financing 
we had a working capital position of  and  at march  and  respectively 
at march   we were in compliance with our loan covenants and current in our principal and interest payments on all debt 
we believe that cash flow from operations and availability under the credit agreement are sufficient to meet our capital requirements and debt service requirements for fiscal we expect to extend the credit agreement upon the current expiration date of august  from time to time  we review potential acquisitions of businesses 
the acquisition of any businesses that would have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations would require us to issue additional equity and or incur additional debt
