item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general our fiscal year results are based on a or week retail calendar ending on the last saturday in december 
fiscal year is based on weeks  with a week fourth quarter 
our comparable sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year 
for  this comparison has been adjusted to a week basis 
fiscal years and include weeks 
overview during  we refocused our efforts on reaching our customers and growing the business while at the same time streamlining our operations 
we reviewed our balance sheet and future commitments and identified certain assets and activities that did not fit with our vision of the future and recorded charges the charges as a result 
see asset impairments discussion for further details 
some of the major contributors to our fiscal year results are summarized below and reviewed further in the segment discussions that follow 
total company sales increased compared to  reflecting comparable or comp sales growth in the north american retail division  a sales increase in the north american business solutions division and a decline in the international division 
sales growth has been adjusted for the effect of the rd week of the impact of the rd week on net earnings is approximately million 
overall company gross margin decreased both due to the effect of the charges and also from competitive pressure and sales mix in the international division  partially offset by positive impacts in north american operations from merchandising initiatives 
these initiatives will continue in after considering the charges impact  our operating expenses as a percent of sales declined from various cost control efforts  higher sales and the added leverage from the rd week of operations 
during the year  we settled various worldwide tax audits  reducing the need for certain tax and related interest accruals and lowering the related expenses for from these discrete impacts 
effective with the start of the third quarter  we began recognizing the expense associated with stock options and other equity awards given to our employees 
operating results dollars in millions sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit store and warehouse operating and selling expenses asset impairments division operating profit general and administrative expenses other operating expenses operating profit our overall sales increased in following an increase of in on a week basis  fiscal sales increased 
the increase reflects higher sales in our north american operations  partially offset by a decline in the international division from reduced local currency sales 
changes in foreign exchange rates on annual sales were not significant 
the increase from to reflects positive impacts from changes in foreign exchange rates and a full year contribution from an international division acquisition in june  as well as stronger retail sales in north america 
internally  we analyze our international operations in terms of local currency performance to allow focus on operating trends and results 
the change in gross profit as a percentage of sales in reflects the net effect of operational improvements in the north american divisions from higher private brand sales and better category management  offset by the effect of a change in mix on sales in north america and declines in gross profit margins in the international division 
cost of goods sold also includes the negative impact from million of inventory related charges 
total store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased in and declined in current year expenses include million of charges 
expenses that were similar in nature to the charges which were recognized in prior years have been isolated for comparative purposes 
amounts recognized in totaled approximately million and million was recognized in after considering those charges  other store and warehouse operating and selling expenses as a percent of sales declined for both north american retail and north american business solutions divisions in and from operational efficiencies and sales leverage 
these reductions in also reflect the success we have realized in improving our advertising cost effectiveness throughout  as well as leverage from the rd week of sales 
effective with the beginning of the third quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r fas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  the unvested portions of previously granted share based payments  as well as the fair value of awards granted after adoption are included in operating expenses over the appropriate service period 
we have decided to use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our stock options  unless additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate for us  or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated using this model 
in the first quarter of  we changed the composition of employee grants to include a mix of restricted stock awards and stock options 
amortization of the fair value of the restricted stock has been included in our results since the grant date 
certain restricted stock and previously granted stock options had features that caused their accelerated vesting during the second half of  resulting in added expense of approximately million 
beyond this acceleration  and the base cost of restricted stock  the incremental impact from expensing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaled approximately million for the third quarter and million for the fourth quarter of similar amounts are expected to be expensed in each of the quarters of relating to existing stock options 
however  we may change these employee programs in future periods  and subsequent year impacts may be different 
the table above provides a subtotal for division operating profit 
our management uses this financial measure of performance internally to assess the operations of each division  and we believe it is useful to investors because it reflects each division s direct activity 
historically  we have not allocated our general and administrative g a expenses to our divisions 
we have been analyzing and developing methods to allocate g a and refine other existing allocations and line item classifications 
we may implement this revised process in the first quarter of fiscal year these revised allocations may impact individual line items and prior period results would then be reclassified for meaningful comparison 
other companies may charge more or less of their g a expenses to their divisions  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by some other entities 
our measure of division operating profit should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net earnings determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the table above reconciles division operating profit to operating profit determined in accordance with gaap 
discussion of other income and expense items  including the charges and changes in interest and taxes follows our review of the operating segments 
north american retail division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales the division operating profit of million includes million of the charges discussed below 
asset impairments  closed store costs and lease adjustments recognized in prior periods that were similar in nature to the charges totaled million in and million in we regularly review actual and projected store performance and record identified asset impairment charges as a component of store and warehouse operating expenses 
total sales in the division increased in over the prior year and on a week basis 
this follows a increase in compared to fifty two week comparable sales in from the stores that were open for more than one year increased  and ended the year with comp sales in the fourth quarter 
in  comp sales from the stores that were open for at least one year increased 
the increasing sales trend reflects effective merchandising and marketing efforts 
during  we improved the effectiveness of our inserts  became the official office supply partner of nascar and continued to enroll customers in our advantage loyalty program 
after considering the impact of the charges  overall gross margins were higher in compared to the prior year from various merchandising initiatives 
we have expanded our selection of private brands which has had a positive impact on gross margins and we expect to continue developing additional product offerings 
we continue to identify ways to lower our cost structure with a range of initiatives from lowering our energy costs with more efficient lighting and adjusting our payroll model  to enhancing the effectiveness of our advertising spend 
during  we opened stores using the m design 
this follows the opening of stores in and stores in we anticipate opening at least stores during north american business solutions division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales the division operating profit of million includes million of the charges discussed below 
an additional million to complete these projects is expected to be recognized in future periods 
also as part of the charges  we identified supply chain network optimization activities that will result in closing some facilities and opening others 
the total costs for these activities are estimated to be million over the years through and will be recognized as plans are implemented and the related accounting recognition criteria are met 
in  we decided to consolidate our call centers from locations to three and outsource certain activities 
we recognized million of severance and other exit related costs from this and related activities 
sales in our north american business solutions division increased in  or on a week basis  and in sales in our contract channel increased in both and from an added sales force and changes in account management 
the increase in reflects broad based revenue growth  while the increase in sales was highest in the national accounts 
during  we began offering a combined catalog to the previously separate office depot and viking catalog customers 
after considering the impact of certain charges  gross margin declined slightly in reflecting some shift in the mix of customers 
during  we reorganized our sales force and decided to consolidate our call centers and outsource certain activities  that process was completed in the third quarter of and we have begun to see some of the anticipated benefits 
our supply chain costs as a percent of sales benefited from operational efficiency initiatives  as well as from sales leverage 
during  our lower delivery expenses were partially offset by higher fuel costs 
international division dollars in millions sales change division operating profit of sales the division operating profit of million includes million related to the charges 
as discussed below  the international division anticipates an additional million of expenses to be recognized over the three years through from function consolidations and warehouse optimization 
division operating profit in includes approximately million of expenses similar in nature to the charges 
sales in our international division declined in on a week basis after increasing in and in in local currencies  sales decreased in  and grew in and in  with those increases primarily reflecting our european acquisition in mid year and foreign currency impacts 
the trend in sales reflects competitive pressures in both the contract and catalog channels and challenging economic conditions in many countries in which we do business 
as part of certain initiatives associated with the charges and other activities  we closed the contract business in one country  as well as retail stores  contributing to the sales decline 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased in both and  reflecting competitive pressures in important product categories across channels  and in a higher mix of lower margin contract sales from a mid acquisition 
in and  the decrease in gross margin has been partially offset by lower net product costs achieved with higher volume sales 
for us reporting  the international division s sales are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates experienced during the year 
the division s sales were negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates in by million  and were positively impacted in by million and in by million 
division segment operating profit was also negatively impacted from foreign exchange rates by million in  and benefited by million in and by million during corporate and other general and administrative expenses dollars in millions general and administrative expenses percentage of sales fiscal year general and administrative g a expenses include approximately million of charges  while included approximately million of executive and staff severance  dispute resolutions  loss on disposal of property and lease termination costs associated with property used in g a functions 
after considering these charges  the remaining change in total g a expenses in compared to reflects the positive impacts of various cost control measures such as lowering professional fees and consolidating functions  partially offset by increases from adoption of fas r and acceleration of certain variable pay and restricted stock awards earned in the increase from to reflects a full year of g a expenses following a european acquisition in mid  as well as the impact of translating all international g a expenses at higher exchange rates 
historically  we have not allocated our g a expenses to our divisions 
we have been analyzing and developing methods to allocate g a and refine other existing allocations and line item classifications 
we may implement this revised process in the first quarter of fiscal year these revised allocations may impact individual line items and prior period results would then be reclassified for meaningful comparison 
the comments above describe how our management has historically presented our g a expenses 
other companies may charge more or less g a expenses and other costs to their segments  and our results therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include pre opening expenses and  in  acquisition integration costs 
pre opening expenses consist of personnel  property and advertising expenses incurred in opening or relocating stores and customer service centers cscs 
on a world wide basis  we opened or relocated stores in  in  and in in  we incurred approximately million of non capitalizable integration costs in connection with our european acquisition in june these costs primarily related to professional consulting fees for assistance with integration  management  internal communications plans  and human resource aspects of the acquisition 
other income and expense dollars in millions interest income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt miscellaneous income  net interest income increased in from modestly higher interest rates and in from higher average cash and cash equivalent balances and higher interest based investment yields 
the decrease in interest expense in reflects a reduction of interest requirements following the favorable settlement of various tax claims  as well as the impact of our redemption in december of the entire issue of the million senior subordinated notes 
the net loss on extinguishment of debt of million included the make whole payment  write off of deferred issuance costs  and recognition of a previously deferred gain related to an interest rate swap 
interest expense increased in reflecting a full year of interest on the million in senior notes that were issued in august at an effective interest rate of  essentially a full year of interest on the million in senior subordinated notes with an effective interest rate of  a full year of interest on approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  as well as interest expense on capital leases 
our net miscellaneous income expense consists of equity in the earnings of our joint venture investments  royalty and franchise income  and realized gains and impairments of other investments 
our equity method investments are non controlling interests in office supply selling operations outside north america  generally operating under the office depot brand name 
earnings from these investments increased million in and million in we continue to look for ways to expand our presence overseas and may enter into additional ventures or increase our investment in existing positions which could result in additional entities being consolidated in future periods 
miscellaneous income  net in also included recognition of approximately million of net foreign currency gains  primarily resulting from holding euro investments in anticipation of a european acquisition in june income taxes dollars in millions income taxes effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 
the effective income tax rates in both and reflect significant period factors 
during  we closed certain worldwide tax audits and adjusted provisions for uncertain tax positions 
we also adjusted certain valuation allowances based on our current assessment of realization of the related deferred tax assets 
this decrease was partially offset by additional tax expense from completing our plans to repatriate additional foreign earnings 
during  we recognized tax expense related to our preliminary assessment of foreign earnings to be repatriated in under the provisions of the american jobs creation act 
we also recognized tax benefits from reducing existing valuation allowances on deferred tax assets  from audit settlements and from the release of previously recorded accruals for uncertain tax positions based on changes in the facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in future periods can be affected by variability in our mix of income  the tax rates in various jurisdictions  changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes  outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process and our assessment of the need of accruals for uncertain tax positions  and therefore may be higher or lower than it has been over the past three years 
asset impairments  exit costs and other charges during the third quarter of  we announced a number of material charges relating to asset impairments  exit costs and other operating decisions the charges 
this announcement followed a wide ranging assessment of assets and commitments which began in the second quarter of we anticipated at that time the pre tax charges would total about million over a multi year period and indicated that the review in the international division would continue 
our current assessment is that charges associated with these worldwide activities will total a higher amount of approximately million 
of this amount  million was recognized in and million is estimated to be recognized in  million in and million in the increase from our third quarter estimate primarily results from the international division s assessment of its operations and facilities and the decision to phase out the guilbert brand in europe 
based on their review  projects were identified relating to process changes ranging from reorganizing and centralizing certain functions to reducing or outsourcing others 
incremental expenses of million related to these additional projects were recognized in the fourth quarter of further  the international division s assessment of future distribution network optimization activities was completed and million of additional expenses from anticipated closures were identified which are now anticipated to be incurred in future periods 
the cost of these new projects  as well as the revised estimates  is included in the aggregate future year estimates above 
the expenses associated with our future projects will be recognized as the individual plans are implemented and the related accounting recognition criteria are met 
as with any estimate  the amounts may change when expenses are incurred 
certain of these decisions about future activities also have impacted results by million from accelerated depreciation and similar charges 
a summary of the charges and the line item presentation of these amounts in our accompanying consolidated statement of earnings is as follows 
in millions amounts cost of goods sold and occupancy costs store and warehouse operating and selling expenses asset impairments general and administrative expenses total pre tax charges income tax effect after tax impact per share impact of the total charges  approximately million is expected to require cash outlay over one business cycle 
an additional million  primarily relating to longer term lease obligations  will require cash as these obligations are liquidated over multi year lease terms  and approximately million is non cash 
charges expected to be recognized in future periods include costs to close facilities and related non vesting severance that cannot be recognized currently  as well as accelerated depreciation and amortization relating to the replacement of assets earlier than previously expected 
significant asset impairments in march  we announced the acquisition from toys r us  inc of former kids r us kru retail store locations for million plus the assumption of lease obligations 
we indicated our intention at the time this acquisition was announced to open approximately of these locations as office depot retail stores and to dispose of the remainder of the acquired properties 
following the acquisition  we recorded all properties planned to be disposed of at their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
through the end of  we have opened stores  closed one and disposed of all but of the remaining properties 
we measure cash flows at the individual store level in assessing the recoverability of store location related assets 
with new store openings  we monitor performance and cash flows and  if early performance is falling below expectations  changes to operations are put in place in an attempt to improve results 
the early performance of many of the kru stores indicated that some adjustments were appropriate and we modified merchandising and marketing programs with the goal of reaching a broader base of business customers and increasing the core office supply sales 
even after implementing these changes  however  it became apparent that these stores would likely continue to experience operating losses and negative cash flows and were performing well below our projections 
having made this determination  we calculated that an million impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of those stores to their estimated fair value 
certain stores in the kru acquisition are meeting original expectations and no impairment has been recorded for these stores 
during we also recognized a million impairment charge relating to our tech depot subsidiary originally acquired as sure 
com 
this unit operates as a stand alone web based complement to our offering of online technology products and services 
as market conditions have changed for technology products we have shifted the emphasis of this subsidiary away from its original business to consumer focus to instead target the business to business customer 
we changed the leadership over this entity and decided to redeploy resources to other higher margin parts of the north american business solutions division 
this decision to change the business model resulted in lower sales expectations for the balance of and for future periods 
revised cash flow projections indicated that the estimated fair value of tech depot was less than its carrying value and  as a result  the goodwill and other intangible assets were written down to estimated fair value 
our international division s assessment of asset utilization continued into the fourth quarter of an estimated fair value based on the useful life of the guilbert trade name had been determined at acquisition assuming its continued long term use 
the business review conducted in the fourth quarter concluded that migrating customers to the office depot brand name and away from the guilbert brand would be beneficial 
accordingly  the estimated useful life of the trade name was changed to coincide with our estimate of a one year migration period 
this change in estimated life resulted in an impairment charge of million being recognized in the remaining asset value will be amortized as an operating expense over the estimated use period 
the kru  tech depot and trade name impairment charges are combined in the consolidated statement of earnings on the line item titled asset impairments 
following the fourth quarter review of goodwill and intangible assets in  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our investment in japan 
that amount has been reclassified out of store and warehouse operating and selling expenses to this line for comparative purposes 
in addition to these significant asset impairment charges  we also recognized significant charges related to exit and other activities 
the total exit and other charges recorded in and anticipated for future periods will be discussed below  as well as where the charges appear in the consolidated statement of earnings 
exit activities we regularly review store performance and future prospects and close under performing locations 
as part of this review  the north american retail division decided to close stores 
the costs of these exit related activities totaled approximately million 
the charges include million of inventory clearance  included in cost of goods sold  and the following items included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses million of asset write offs  million of severance related costs and million to record the liability for estimated future lease obligations  net of anticipated sublease income 
all closure activity was completed by the end of the north american business solutions division has decided to combine two catalog offerings into one office depot catalog 
in recent years  the distinction between the company s two separate catalog offerings in the united states office depot and viking has become less clear to consumers 
the internal migration of viking to office depot catalogs was largely completed during as part of this consolidation  we will no longer separately market the viking brand in the united states and will dispose of viking unique inventory  eliminating the need for two warehouses 
those warehouses stopped shipping merchandise by the end of and customer fulfillment has been absorbed within existing facilities 
to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the division  we are also reorganizing certain warehouse staffing functions and relocating certain sales offices to available space in retail locations 
these activities are in process and should be complete by the second quarter of the charges associated with exit and consolidation activities in the north american business solutions division include some changes in estimates as well as other consolidation opportunities 
the cost is now estimated to be approximately million  with million recognized in and million expected in of the million recognized in  million related to inventory clearance and disposal and is included in cost of goods sold 
the following items are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses million of severance  million for a lease termination  and million of accelerated depreciation and amortization  asset write offs and other costs 
an additional million of severance is included in g a expenses 
the future period charges are largely accelerated depreciation and amortization over the assets continued use period  severance accruals and other exit costs 
it should be noted that the company presently has no plans to consolidate the viking and office depot brands in europe where the viking brand enjoys a large and loyal customer following 
the international division s current plan is to close retail stores and one warehouse  consolidate certain call center facilities and consolidate certain contract operations 
seven of the stores and the warehouse were closed by the end of and the remainder are expected to close in the international division s assessment of efficiency opportunities has identified further function consolidation  closures and outsourcing steps needed to improve operations 
with the intent of further integrating and consolidating european operations  certain management and functional positions have been eliminated or are in the process of being restructured 
the expected costs of these closure  relocation and exit activities total approximately million  of which million was recognized  million is anticipated in  million in and million in of the charges  million related to inventory clearance and disposal and is included in cost of goods sold  and the following amounts are included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses million relates to asset write offs  million for severance and million for lease obligations and other costs 
severance of million is included in g a expenses 
the anticipated future charges include additional depreciation  recognition of lease obligations following the facility s use period  severance and other exit costs 
other charges we regularly review surplus properties which remain from prior period exit activities 
the review assesses the current marketability and sublease income estimates of each of the locations 
during  we reached agreement to terminate many existing surplus property leases 
we will continue to identify possible terminations at terms economic to the company 
in addition  for some of the properties in the portfolio not terminated  we recognized a charge to adjust estimates to current marketability and sublease assumptions 
the charge for lease adjustments included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses totaled million  including million for terminations 
we will continue to seek terminations of surplus property leases on terms that are considered beneficial 
charges for other asset write downs  impairments  and accelerated depreciation and amortization of approximately million were identified 
of this amount  was recorded in with million recorded in g a expenses and recorded in store and warehouse operating and selling expense 
we expect to record million in and million in the current period charge primarily reflects the write off of computer software and hardware and other assets that have been taken out of service and store asset impairments of million recognized based on our analysis of locations other than the kru properties discussed above 
all other items totaled approximately million  of which million was recorded in the primary impact was million related to accelerated inventory clearance activity in preparation of implementation of a new inventory management system  as well as anticipated elimination of certain inventory lines in europe 
the impact of clearance and valuation of this inventory is included in cost of goods sold 
the remainder primarily relates to cancellation of certain long term advertising and other commitments  million is included in g a expenses and million is included in store and warehouse operating and selling expenses 
we expect to record approximately million for similar items in future period actions in addition to the exit related charges recognized in  we anticipate closing or relocating other warehouses and distribution centers in both the north american business solutions division and the international division during fiscal years through the costs associated with these activities will be recognized in future periods as incurred

see note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and note h for a discussion of our employee benefit plans  including the pension plans and the deferred compensation plan 
in addition to the above  we have letters of credit totaling million outstanding at the end of the year  and we have recourse for private label credit card receivables transferred to a third party 
we record a fair value estimate for losses on these receivables in our financial statements 
the total outstanding amount transferred to a third party at the end of the year was approximately million 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed on the previous contractual obligations and table 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates 
some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have also identified certain accounting policies that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies 
vendor arrangements each year  we enter into purchase arrangements with many of our vendors that provide for those vendors to make payments to us if and when certain conditions are met 
these arrangements are generally referred to as vendor programs  and typically fall into two broad categories  with some underlying sub categories 
the largest category is volume based rebates 
generally  our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached 
many of our vendor agreements provide that we pay higher per unit costs prior to reaching a predetermined milestone  at which time the vendor rebates the per unit differential on past purchases  and also applies the lower cost to future purchases until the next milestone is reached 
current accounting rules provide that companies with a sound basis for estimating their full year purchases  and therefore the ultimate rebate level  can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year 
we believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a sound basis for our estimates 
if the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached  however  or if we form the belief in any given point in the year that it is not likely to be reached  cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook 
we review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly 
while vendor rebates are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates  the final amounts due from vendors are generally known soon after year end 
substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are collected within the three months immediately following year end 
we believe that our historic collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year 
we also have arrangements with our vendors that are event based 
these arrangements can take many forms  but two primary types cover i reimbursement for our advertising sometimes referred to as cooperative or co op advertising and ii specific promotional activities 
these advertising arrangements are classified as a reduction of product costs  reducing costs of goods sold and inventory 
event based arrangements include special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time  payments for special placement or promotion of a product  reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor s product  and various other special programs 
these payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory  as appropriate for the program 
additionally  we receive payments from vendors for certain of our activities that lower the vendor s cost to ship their product 
such receipts are recognized as a reduction of our cost of goods sold 
agreements reached with vendors generally cover one year  but vendor program and cooperative advertising arrangements can change between years 
these arrangements can be influenced by increases or reductions in inventory purchases compared to company plans and programs offered by the vendors 
while there are long standing volume and pricing conventions in the office products industry  such program arrangements are regularly renegotiated  and as such  are subject to change 
if these vendor program arrangements were materially less beneficial  we could either increase the selling price of the vendor s product  which may impact sales volume  or experience a decline in profitability 
inventory valuation our selling model is predicated on the breadth and availability of our product assortment  and our profitability is dependent on high inventory turnover rates 
we monitor inventory on hand by location  particularly as it relates to trailing and projected sales trends 
when slow moving inventory is identified  or we decide to discontinue merchandise  we review for estimated recoverability and  if necessary  record a charge to reduce the carrying value to our assessment of the lower of cost or market 
this assessment is based on the quality of the merchandise  the rate of sale  and our assessment of market conditions 
additional cost adjustments and sales markdowns will be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed 
estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level  and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale 
intangible asset testing absent any circumstances that warrant testing at another time  we test for goodwill and non amortizing intangible asset impairment as part of our year end closing process 
our goodwill testing consists of comparing the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units to their carrying amounts  including recorded goodwill 
we estimate the fair values of each of our reporting units by discounting their projected future cash flows 
our projections are based on the budget for the succeeding year and multi year forecasts 
developing these future cash flow projections requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates regarding the sales  gross margin and operating expenses of our reporting units  as well as economic conditions and the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  or should our operating plans or business model change  future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
any such write down would be included in the operating expenses of the business unit 
because of changes in circumstances that occurred in  we tested for goodwill impairment at our tech depot subsidiary at that time and recorded an impairment charge 
we also recognized an impairment charge in at the time we committed to a phase out plan relating to a previously non amortizing intangible asset 
additionally  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized in because the performance of our business in japan did not meet the assumptions used in the prior year s testing of goodwill 
while we make reasoned estimates of future performance  actual results below these expectations  or changes in business direction can result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
closed store reserves and asset impairments we assess on a regular basis the performance of each retail store against historic patterns and projections of future profitability 
these assessments are based on management s estimates for sales growth  gross margin attainments  and cash flow generation 
if  as a result of these evaluations  management determines that a store will not achieve certain targets  the decision may be made to close the store 
when a store is no longer used for operating purposes  we recognize a liability for the remaining costs related to the property  reduced by an estimate of any sublease income 
the calculation of this liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the remaining term of the lease including vacancy period  anticipated sublease income  and costs associated with vacating the premises 
with assistance from independent third parties to assess market conditions  we periodically review these judgments and estimates and adjust the liability accordingly 
we adjusted the carrying value of some of these obligations as part of the charges and similar lease obligation adjustments were recognized in future fluctuations in the economy and the market demand for commercial properties could result in material changes in this liability 
costs associated with facility closures are included in store and warehouse operating expenses 
in addition to the decision about whether or not to close a store  store assets are regularly reviewed for recoverability of their carrying amounts 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates of a store s future cash flows 
new stores may require years to develop a customer base necessary to achieve expected cash flows and we typically do not test for impairment during this early stage 
however  if in subsequent periods  the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying amount of the store s assets  an impairment charge is recorded to operations as a component of operating and selling expenses 
to the extent that management s estimates of future performance are not realized  future assessments could result in material impairment charges 
as discussed above  the charges include significant impairment charges 
income taxes income tax accounting requires management to make estimates and apply judgments to events that will be recognized in one period under rules that apply to financial reporting and in a different period in the company s tax returns 
in particular  judgment is required when estimating the value of future tax deductions  tax credits  and net operating loss carryforwards nols  as represented by deferred tax assets 
when we believe the recovery of all or a portion of a deferred tax asset is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
generally  changes in judgments that increase or decrease these valuation allowances impact current earnings 
decreases in valuation allowances associated with nols acquired in a business combination reduce goodwill 
in addition to judgments associated with valuation accounts  our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from domestic and international sources may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly 
we file our tax returns based on our best understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
the financial accounting standards board has been evaluating the accounting for uncertain tax positions and is likely to issue guidance during for all companies to follow 
we believe our current processes are consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant trends  developments and uncertainties over the years  we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business 
in particular  mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs  as well as grocery and drugstore chains  have increased their assortment of home office merchandise  attracting additional back to school customers and year round casual shoppers 
we also face competition from other office supply superstores that compete directly with us in numerous markets 
this competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing  product selection and services provided 
many of these retail competitors  including discounters  warehouse clubs  and drug stores and grocery chains  carry basic office supply products 
some of them have also begun to feature technology products 
many of them price certain of these offerings lower than we do  but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time 
this trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend in our industry 
we have also seen growth in competitors that offer office products over the internet  featuring special purchase incentives and one time deals such as close outs 
through our own successful internet and business to business web sites  we believe that we have positioned ourselves competitively in the e commerce arena 
another trend in our industry has been consolidation  as competitors in office supply stores and the copy print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger  well capitalized corporations 
this trend towards consolidation  coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations  is potentially a significant trend in our industry 
we regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans 
market sensitive risks and positions we have market risk exposure related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
we manage the exposure to market risks at the corporate level 
the portfolio of interest sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored and adjusted to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short term needs 
our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only  speculation on interest rates or foreign currency rates is not permitted 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash equivalents and debt obligations 
the impact on cash and short term investments held at the end of from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would be a decrease in interest income of approximately million in market risk associated with our debt portfolio is summarized below dollars in thousands carrying fair risk carrying fair risk value value sensitivity value value sensitivity million senior notes revolving credit facility including current maturities 
the risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a basis point decrease in interest rates  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
the sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year end 
in  we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements to receive fixed and pay floating rates  converting the equivalent of million of this portfolio to variable rate debt through those swaps were closed during and the gain is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligation 
foreign exchange rate risk we conduct business in various countries outside the united states where the functional currency of the country is not the us dollar 
our expansion in europe in recent years increased the proportion of our operations in countries with euro and british pound functional currencies 
the weakening of the us dollar compared to other currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  has positively impacted our results during and by increasing reported sales and operating profit  however  a strengthening of the us dollar during adversely impacted our results 
we continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation against the us dollar 
as of december   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately million 
although operations generally are conducted in the relevant local currency  we are also subject to foreign exchange transaction exposure when our subsidiaries transact business in a currency other than their own functional currency 
this exposure arises primarily from a limited amount of inventory purchases in a foreign currency 
foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain inventory exposures were million at their highest point during also during  we were in the process of assessing the one time benefits of repatriating cash held in our european subsidiaries 
as this analysis was being completed and as cash was moving through various foreign entities  some with different functional currencies  we entered into foreign currency forward transactions to protect against currency movements 
generally  we view our international businesses internally by focusing on the local currency results of the business  and not with regard to the translation into us dollars  as the latter is generally beyond our control 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations 
we consider our business to be only somewhat seasonal  with sales in our north american retail division slightly lower during the second quarter
