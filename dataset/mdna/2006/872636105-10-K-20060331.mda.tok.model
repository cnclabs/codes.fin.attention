overview we are a large scale  multinational owner and operator of atm networks with operations in the united states  the united kingdom and canada 
during our networks had an average of  transacting atms 
in addition  with an average of  self service merchant based photocopiers in the united states  the united kingdom and canada during  we believe we have the largest such photocopier network in the world 
the operating environment that we faced in was significantly different from  particularly with respect to the following we acquired efunds in november and  as a result reflected less than two months of operations associated with the atm contracts we acquired from efunds and consequently resulted in an increase of sales  sales discounts  amortization expenses and labor expenses  we incurred substantial expenses and costs in connection with the efforts to acquire the united kingdom atm network of travelex in  we incurred increased cash losses resulting from atm thefts in the united kingdom during  we incurred significant costs  principally third party professional costs  associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  with which we had to fully comply for the first time in  and we incurred substantial costs associated with the required triple des and emv upgrades of united kingdom atms in  and we significantly increased our provision for bad debts 
as a result we incurred a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in subsequent to the end of fiscal year  based upon our financial performance during the second half of  we determined that we were in default under certain financial covenants contained in the credit facility administered by bank of america 
we have entered into a forbearance agreement with the lenders with respect to that facility 
for a discussion of these defaults  the forbearance agreement and their effects on us  see liquidity and capital resources bank of america credit facility 
atm operations 
we entered the atm business in  believing it to be a natural extension of our background in providing photocopiers to consumers in retail environments 
in the years since we entered the business we have expanded our atm networks to include  average transacting atms in we have been able to grow our atm business by acquiring atms or atm networks  establishing new merchant relationships  expanding existing merchant relationships and displacing existing third party operators as their contracts expire 
as a result of the increasing size of our atm networks  improved transaction pricing  our institution of a redeployment program for underperforming machines and favorable exchange rate movements  our atm net sales increased from million in to million in and million in atm acquisitions 
from the second half of through the end of  we actively pursued acquisitions of atm networks 
we acquired a atm us network in february from a company that continues to serve as a distributor for us 
in june  we entered the canadian atm market through our acquisition of mighty cash  which had atms 
we added atms to our uk networks through our acquisition of inkas financial in march  and added atms to our uk networks by purchasing a portfolio of contracts in july in november  we acquired the atm business of efunds  including ownership and or management of approximately  atms in the united states and  atms in canada 
during the third quarter of we entered into agreements to acquire the atm business of travelex uk limited in the united kingdom 
we have subsequently determined that it is unlikely that we will complete this acquisition and one other atm business that we had been evaluating  and previously capitalized external costs totaling million relating to these acquisitions were charged to expense in the fourth quarter of as a result of our default under our bank of america credit facility  we do not expect to have any significant acquisitions in photocopier operations 
we entered the photocopier business in as a result of increased competition from specialty full service business centers  copy and print shops  photocopiers located at other convenient merchant locations and home photocopiers and printers  the average number of photocopies made per installed machine has declined from  in to  in and  in in and  we continued our strategy  first instituted in  of seeking to offset a long term trend of declining photocopier volumes through increases in photocopier pricing and cost savings 
in addition  we started a program in to remove low volume photocopiers from service or redeploy them to higher traffic locations 
as a result  we reduced the number of photocopiers we had in service from an average of  during to an average of  during our photocopier net sales in were million  a decrease of million from million of photocopier net sales for

during  sales and expenses were affected by the decline in value of the united states dollar as compared to the british pound and an increase as compared to the canadian dollar 
approximately of our consolidated sales for were produced in the united kingdom by our united kingdom subsidiaries and were produced in canada by our canadian subsidiary 
the average exchange rate during for the british pound was to  compared to to during  while the average exchange rate for the canadian dollar was us to c in as compared to us to c in as a result of this increase in the value of the canadian dollar  we reported million more in sales during than we would have reported had the exchange rate remained constant at the average for this gain was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in expenses 
the decrease in the value of the british pound resulted in a decrease in reported sales of  atm sales 
we derive most of our atm sales from transaction based sales 
we also effect atm sales from the sale of atm equipment and third party service sales 
we describe these sources of sales below 
transaction based sales sales we derive from withdrawal fees and interchange fees 
withdrawal fees fees we collect from a customer for making an atm withdrawal 
withdrawal fees are sometimes referred to as surcharge or convenience fees in the industry 
interchange fees fees that an eftn charges the customer s financial institution for routing a withdrawal transaction or an account balance inquiry 
the interchange fee is shared between the eftn and us  as the atm operator  based on an agreement between us and the eftn 
interchange fees apply on all transactions on atms that we own and atms owned by merchants and managed or operated by us in the united states  however  in the united kingdom an interchange fee is only paid on transactions that do not carry a withdrawal fee and in canada an interchange fee is only paid in connection with a withdrawal 
service sales fees we charge for providing repair and maintenance services to merchants who purchase or rent atms from us and to third party atm operators 
sales of atm equipment proceeds from sales of atm equipment to merchants in our merchant owned program and to independent operators 
atm sales were million for compared to million for the million increase in atm sales was due to a combination of a million increase in transaction based sales  a million increase in service sales  and a million increase in sales of atm equipment 

table of contents the million increase in transaction based sales resulted from the expansion of our atm network 
the average number of transacting atms in our network during increased by compared to the increase of  average atms reflects the acquisition of existing atm contracts between february and july and the acquisition of the efunds network transacting in november in addition to sales of new contracts by our sales force 
although the average number of transacting atms in is substantially higher than in  during we have had a decrease in transacting atms  primarily as a result of attrition in atm contracts acquired from efunds in the average number of transacting atms in our networks declined by from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of see item a risk factors risks relating to our atm business if merchant owned atm customers terminate their relationships with us prior to the termination of their contracts or do not renew their contracts upon their expiration  it could reduce our atm sales 
the increase in compared to was partially offset by a decline in the average number of withdrawals per unit 
average withdrawals per atm per month decreased by to for compared to for the decrease in average monthly withdrawals per atm was caused by the atm contracts acquired from efunds in november which historically had lower transactions per unit than our then existing networks 
a decrease in average transaction based sales per withdrawal transaction  to in compared to in the decrease in average transaction based sales per withdrawal was primarily due to the acquisition of the efunds network in november the atms acquired from efunds had substantially lower transaction based sales per withdrawal transaction than our historical averages 
the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar increased for compared to  resulting in a million increase in atm sales 
this increase was substantially offset by the exchange rate related increase in costs 
visa plus  which accounted for approximately of our united states atm transactions during the year ended december   has divided atm providers into two tiers  and reduced the interchange fees it pays to second tier providers for withdrawals and balance inquiries by 
per transaction  effective october  our atms do not meet all of the requirements for first tier status 
as a means of mitigating the impact of the lower interchange rates paid by visa plus we have had our processing agents adjust priority routing tables to  whenever applicable agreements permit  move transactions through eftns whose interchange rates are higher than those paid by visa plus 
the cirrus and mastercard networks implemented a 
per transaction atm convenience fee in april this fee is netted out of interchange dollars paid to us 
for the year ended december   approximately of our united states transactions routed through the cirrus and mastercard networks 
photocopier sales 
we derive sales from our photocopier operations from the per copy fees that customers pay 
photocopier sales in were million  down million compared to the million decrease resulted primarily from declining photocopy volume continuing a trend  photocopy volume declined by for compared to  to million copies from million copies  due to a combination of a decline in installed photocopiers to an average of  in from an average of  in  as we continued a program of eliminating lower volume sites that were unprofitable  and a decline in the average number of photocopies made per unit per month to  in from  in due to price increases and competition from alternative media and photocopying services 
the declining volume was partially offset by price increases the average sales price per photocopy increased to in from in as a result of our working with merchants to implement price increases in certain photocopier locations in late sales discounts our merchants receive fees from transactions generated by the equipment on their premises 
these fees  or sales discounts  represent a share of transaction fees for our atms and per copy fees for our photocopiers 
the amount of the discount depends on a variety of factors  including the type of arrangement under which we place the equipment with the merchant and the number of transactions at the atm or photocopier 
sales discounts on a consolidated basis as a percentage of sales were in and in sales discounts in the atm business increased to of transaction based sales in from in the increased discounts were caused by an increase in the percentage of merchants who both own the atm and provide their own cash in their atms 
most of the atms acquired during are merchant owned 
sales discounts in the photocopier business remained constant at of sales 
cost of sales cost of sales on a consolidated basis decreased to of sales in  from in cost of sales as a percentage of sales declined in our atm segment and increased in our photocopier segment 

table of contents atm cost of sales 
cost of sales in the atm business increased by million to million in from million in  as a result of the increase in atms in our networks to an average of  transacting atms in compared to an average of  in primarily due to the increased numbers of atms in our networks and the increase in transactions processed in compared to  our cost of vault cash increased million  armored car carrier costs increased million  third party service expense increased million  depreciation of atm equipment increased million and processing and telecommunications expense increased million 
we also had a million increase in unreimbursed theft losses in in the past we have had crime insurance to reimburse us for losses that exceed certain deductible levels 
for the policy year beginning july   due to proposed increases in both the deductible level and the cost of the insurance  we began insuring only against catastrophic cash losses 
photocopier cost of sales 
cost of sales in our photocopier business decreased by million  to million in from million in  due primarily to a decrease in photocopy volume 
the reduction in photocopy volume resulted in a decline in the cost of paper and other supplies of  in addition  we received a million settlement from a vendor relating to our photocopier equipment which we have recorded as a reduction to cost of sales in our photocopier segment 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased by million to million in from million in however  selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to in from in specific increases included a million increase in amortization expense due to amortization of intangible assets relating primarily to atm contracts acquired in a million increase in labor related expense 
this increase was caused by an increase in administrative employees necessary to accommodate our expanding business  including integration of businesses acquired in a million increase in outsourced services  primarily services relating to the atm networks acquired from efunds corporation in a million increase in legal  accounting and consulting services due primarily to first year compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
a million increase in bad debts expense  primarily in our atm segment 
abandoned acquisition costs we determined that it was unlikely that we will complete the acquisition of the atm business of travelex uk limited and one other atm business that we had been evaluating 
as a result  we charged to expense in the fourth quarter of a total of million of previously capitalized external costs relating to these potential acquisitions 
asset write offs asset write offs increased by million in as a result of increased theft and damage to our atm machines in and an evaluation of equipment in storage and determination that certain equipment was no longer available for use 
interest expense interest expense increased by million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to borrowings on our credit facility established in the fourth quarter of to finance the acquisition of the efunds atm business

liquidity and capital resources general during  we received million in net proceeds from a sale of our common stock 
we also generated million in cash flows from operating activities in as compared to million in during we sold shares of a publicly traded united kingdom atm company that we had purchased primarily in we received proceeds of million from the sale 
we used these cash flows for the following purposes to make payments totaling million on our long term debt  of which million was derived from proceeds from our offering of common stock  to make million in purchases and upgrades of equipment  primarily atm equipment  to make payments of million on capital lease obligations 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   compared to million as of december  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  inventories decreased million  primarily reflecting the completion of the emv upgrade project in the untied kingdom during as discussed further under the caption bank of america credit facility below  as a result of our defaults under that facility and the subsequent forbearance agreement and amendment that currently terminates on june   we have classified all of the million debt outstanding under that credit facility as a current liability 
pursuant to cross default provisions in trm inventory funding trust s loan and servicing agreement  the lender thereunder has asserted that the defaults under our credit facility with bank of america have resulted in a default under the loan and servicing agreement 
we have entered into a forbearance agreement with the lender that terminates on june  as a result of the claimed default and the forbearance agreement  we have also classified the million debt outstanding under that agreement as a current liability 
as a result  our net working capital deficit has increased to million at december   from million at december  we expect to be able to refinance the outstanding balances under our credit facility and have begun initial efforts to do so 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish the refinancing by june  assuming that we are able to refinance the outstanding balances under our bank of america credit facility and no further defaults occur under such credit facility  we expect that the funds availability under our credit facility combined with positive cash flows from our operating activities will provide adequate liquidity for our continuing operations 
if we refinance the outstanding balances under our credit facility or if the payment of the outstanding balance is demanded by the lenders  the remaining unamortized deferred financing cost of million as of december  associated with this credit facility may be written off in the period of refinancing or demand 
as we discussed in item  business governmental and industry regulations  we believe that the total cost of upgrading the atms we own in the united states to comply with new industry standards known as triple des will be approximately million 
these costs are being capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the related assets 
as of december  approximately of the atms we own in the united states were not compliant with triple des 
similar upgrades to meet emv and triple des standards in the united kingdom were complete at december   at a cost of approximately million 

table of contents bank of america credit facility general 
in connection with the acquisition of efunds atm business on november   we  together with our united kingdom subsidiary  trm atm limited  which we refer to as trm ltd  entered into a million syndicated loan facility underwritten and arranged by bank of america  n 
a  which replaced our previous million line of credit 
the credit facility included a revolving domestic commitment of up to million  an alternative foreign currency commitment of up to million  and a term loan commitment of up to million 
at the time we request additional amounts  we have the right to direct whether such additional amounts are advanced under the revolving commitment as revolving loans  letter of credit obligations or swing line loans or under the alternative currency commitment as foreign loans in a currency other than united states dollars 
in we borrowed the million available under the term loan commitment in order to finance  in part  our acquisition of efunds atm business 
in november  under the terms of the term loan agreement  we made a million payment to reduce the principal balance of our term loan using part of the sales proceeds from our share purchase agreement that closed in october on march   because of defaults in covenants requiring certain funded debt to earnings and debt coverage ratios  we entered into a forbearance agreement and amendment with the lenders 
pursuant to this agreement and subject to certain conditions  the lenders have agreed until june   to forbear from exercising any and all rights or remedies available to them as a result of the forgoing events of default 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the maximum amounts available under our domestic and foreign lines of credit until june  are million and million  respectively 
the amendment to our agreement also increased the interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility which we describe in maturity date and interest rate below 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will meet the financial covenants at the end of the second quarter of  in which case the lenders will have the right to require payment in full of our outstanding debt 
therefore  the entire balance of the term loan and borrowings under the lines of credit is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
maturity date and interest rate 
subject to earlier call as a result of our defaults and the forbearance agreement and amendment described above  the maturity date of any loans extended under the revolving commitment and the alternative currency commitment is november   while the maturity date of the loan extended under the term loan commitment is november  the credit facility bears interest at one of two rates  elected at our option for the term loan and the revolving and alternative currency loans the base rate plus the applicable rate  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus the applicable rate plus mandatory costs 
the base rate is equal to the higher of the federal funds rate  plus of  or the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its prime rate 
libor is the british bankers association libor as published by reuters 
mandatory costs reflect the costs of compliance with the requirements of the bank of england and or the financial services authority and the requirements of the european central bank 
the applicable rate for revolving loans and alternative currency loans under the credit agreement  as amended by the forbearance agreement and amendment  is as follows where our consolidated leverage ratio  that is  the ratio of our debt to our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is less than  the applicable rate is for libor loans and letters of credit and for base rate loans  where our consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to but less than  the applicable rate is for libor loans and letters of credit and for base rate loans  where our consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to but less than  the applicable rate is for libor loans and letters of credit and for base rate loans  and 
table of contents where our consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to  the applicable rate is for libor loans and letters of credit and for base rate loans 
the applicable rate for the term loan under the amended agreement is as follows where our consolidated leverage ratio is less than  the applicable rate is for libor loans and for base rate loans  and where our consolidated leverage ratio is greater than or equal to  the applicable rate is for libor loans and for base rate loans 
an alternative currency loan must accrue interest as a libor loan 
as of december   we owed million on the facility  consisting of million on the term loan and million on the lines of credit 
in addition  bank of america had issued a letter of credit in the amount of million to guarantee our performance under an agreement relating to trm inventory funding trust and letters of credit totaling million million in connection with our effort to acquire the atm business of travelex  leaving a balance available under our lines of credit of million as of december  as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the term loan was  interest rates on the domestic and foreign lines of credit were and  respectively 
in the first quarter of we purchased an interest rate cap  under which we will maintain at least million of the term loan at a day libor rate not to exceed plus applicable rate plus mandatory costs 
collateral 
the credit facility is collateralized by the pledge of the outstanding equity interests in our united states subsidiaries and by the pledge of of the outstanding equity interests of each canadian and united kingdom subsidiary 
in addition  the credit facility is collateralized by a mortgage on all property held by us  whether owned or leased  subject to certain limited exceptions 
prepayment 
we may be required to prepay the loans under certain conditions  including the following of the net cash proceeds received by us as a result of certain dispositions must be applied toward the credit facility  to the extent that such net cash proceeds are not reinvested within days of the date of disposition in assets useful in the same or similar lines of business to that in which we were engaged as of the closing date 
of the consolidated excess cash flow received by us for any fiscal year must be applied toward the credit facility reduced to if our consolidated leverage ratio as of the last day of such fiscal year is less than of the net cash proceeds received by us as a result of any debt issuance must be applied toward the credit facility 
of the net cash proceeds received by us as a result of any equity issuance must be applied toward the credit facility 
in addition  we are required to pay million in principal on the term loan quarterly 
any prepayments of principal that we make as a result of the actions listed above will be credited ratably against future repayment obligations 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million  increased on a cumulative basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter by an amount equal to of consolidated net income for the fiscal quarter then ended 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a leverage ratio  that is a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda  as follows for fiscal and thereafter from january  through september   from october  through september   and from october through the maturity date 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  that is a ratio of earning before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash expenses to fixed charges  including taxes paid  interest paid  scheduled debt payments  cash dividends and distributions except those permitted under the credit agreement as follows 
table of contents for for the first three quarters of  for the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of  and thereafter the credit agreement contains covenants customary for loans of this size  including restrictions on incurring additional debt and fundamental changes 
it also contains a covenant from us that we will not permit consolidated capital expenditures to exceed million in  and million per year for any fiscal year thereafter  and permits us to pay dividends only on our preferred equity without lender consent 
the events which constitute an event of default under the credit agreement are also customary for loans of this size  including payment defaults  breaches of our representations and covenants  adverse judgments against us in excess of a specified amount and a change in control 
united states vault cash facility general 
in march  we established a facility for funding the cash which is placed in our atm equipment which we refer to as vault cash for our united states atms 
we currently have access to million of vault cash under the facility of which million was being used at december  the facility is based on the relationship between three primary companies 
these companies are trm inventory funding trust  or the trust 
the trust is a delaware business trust that was created pursuant to a deposit trust agreement between gss holdings  inc as depositor  wilmington trust company as owner trustee  and trm atm corporation as servicer 
the majority equity holder in the trust is autobahn funding company  llc  and the minority equity holder is gss holdings  inc neither we  trm atm corporation nor any of our other affiliates have any ownership interest in the trust 
trm atm corporation  or trm atm 
trm atm is one of our subsidiaries and acts as the servicer under the facility 
autobahn funding company  llc  or autobahn 
autobahn is an affiliate of dz bank ag  deutsche zentral genossenschaftsbank frankfurt am main  which is the lender under the facility 
autobahn is independent of us  trm atm and our other affiliates 
as set forth in liquidity and capital resources general  dz bank has asserted  based upon a cross default provision in the loan and servicing agreement  that the defaults under our bank of america credit facility constitute a default under the loan and servicing agreement 
we have entered into a forbearance agreement under which dz bank has agreed to forbear from asserting that default until june  see item a risk factors risk relating to our default under our credit agreement 
operation of the facility 
we obtain our vault cash under the facility pursuant to a loan and servicing agreement 
in accordance with that agreement  autobahn raises funds by issuing asset backed commercial paper 
autobahn then loans those funds to the trust at an interest rate equal to the interest rate borne by the commercial paper plus 
the loaned funds are then deposited into an account from which  at the direction of trm atm acting as the servicer of the facility  they are disbursed to an armored car carrier for transportation to our united states atms 
the loaned funds are then available for withdrawal from the atms by the public 
the cash at all times remains the property of the trust  and the trust is ultimately obligated to repay autobahn 
the trust  as borrower under the facility  and trm atm  as servicer  use their cash from operations  which is principally derived from atm withdrawal and interchange fees  to fund a settlement account from which  in combination with its vault cash  trm atm directs repayment of the loans to the trust  the interest on the loans  a specified return on the equity investment made by the investors in the trust and the fees described below 
the trust engages trm atm  as servicer  and other agents and contractors from time to time to perform all duties assigned under the loan and servicing agreement 
under the terms of the november amendment to the facility  trm atm is permitted to subservice certain servicing functions to efunds pursuant to a master services agreement 
for a more complete description of the master services agreement and the acquisition of the efunds atm business  see business acquisition of the efunds atm business 
the loan and servicing agreement contains covenants applicable to us  including a minimum tangible net worth requirement 

table of contents collateral and credit enhancement 
the trust s borrowings from autobahn are collateralized by the assets of the trust  principally the vault cash 
in addition  where the vault cash is placed in an atm  the trust has a security interest in all of the fees and charges earned or received with respect to that atm until those fees are distributed to trm atm 
autobahn is a party to a liquidity purchase agreement with other lenders  which ensures that the trust continues to have funds available for the term of the agreement and that autobahn will have the funds necessary to repay the commercial paper it issues 
each lender party to the agreement is required to have a credit rating at least as high as the credit rating of the commercial paper that autobahn issues 
cost of the facility 
the primary costs paid in connection with the facility are interest on the loaned funds 
the loans bear interest at an interest rate equal to plus the interest rate borne by the commercial paper that was issued to raise the funds for the loans 
return for equity investors 
autobahn and gss holdings  inc  as equity investors in the trust  receive a return on the value of their investments  which were  and  respectively  as of december  autobahn s annual return is equal to plus the interest rate borne by the commercial paper that is outstanding 
gss holdings annual return is equal to 
fees 
autobahn receives a commitment fee and trm atm  as servicer  and the collateral agent each receive administrative fees in connection with the facility 
risk of loss and insurance 
any risk with regard to the trust or the ability of the trust to repay the trust s debt resides with the trust and with gss holdings as the minority equity investor and with autobahn as the majority equity investor 
trm atm serves only as an administrator or servicer of the trust 
we maintain letters of credit totaling million  or of loans outstanding on december   to guarantee the performance of the servicer of the facility 
the trust s subcontractors maintain insurance on behalf of the trust so as to ensure the cash is safe while stored at correspondent banks  and during delivery to atm equipment and to vault or bank storage facilities

borrowings under this facility constitute capital lease obligations with terms ranging from three years to five years 
as of december   we had  of outstanding lease financing under this facility 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual commitments and obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total after trm corporation and subsidiaries long term bank debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total trm corporation and subsidiaries trm inventory funding trust note payable total contractual cash obligations the long term bank debt and trm inventory funding trust note payable are shown above in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  because we believe it is likely that our creditors may be able to demand payment of those debts during  we have classified them as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the above payments include interest were applicable  with interest on variable rate obligations assumed to remain constant at the rate in effect as of december  purchase obligations consist of a master services agreement with efunds  which involves payment totaling at least million annually over an initial term of five years 
we ceased paying dividends on our series a preferred stock after as a result of the prohibitions contained in our credit facility with bank of america and cash flow concerns 
we resumed payment in the third quarter of and made the regularly scheduled payments of these dividends thereafter 
during we paid all dividends that had previously accrued with respect to the series a preferred stock 
in march  the remaining series a preferred stock automatically converted into common stock 
discontinued and restructured operations in we discontinued certain operations of iatmglobal 
net  a subsidiary involved in software development for advanced atm functions 
these operations  which were eventually sold to ncr corporation  contributed million and  of our net losses in and  respectively 
we retained a division of iatmglobal 
net  strategic software solutions sss  the principal source of sales of which was a software development contract with ncr that we substantially completed in the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we decided to discontinue efforts in the software development segment of our business 
in december  the last employee of sss was terminated  and we negotiated termination of sss s office lease and accrued a related termination payment 
therefore  results in the software development segment have been reflected as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  sales  costs and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to depreciation  intangible assets  accounts receivable  inventories  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and to understanding the results of those operations 
our use of the units of production method of depreciation for our analog konica photocopiers requires us to estimate their useful life 
we have estimated that the useful life of these assets is an average of  photocopies per machine 
as of december   we carried our analog konica photocopiers on our books at a cost of million less accumulated depreciation of million 
if future losses on disposal or significant decreases in the annual photocopy volume of this class of photocopiers become evidence of a shorter useful life than our original estimate  we will change the depreciable life  resulting in additional depreciation charges on a prospective basis 
if the estimated total production volume of these photocopiers were increased by  or  photocopies  our consolidated depreciation expense for would have decreased by approximately  if the estimated total production volume were decreased by the same amount  our consolidated depreciation expense would have increased by approximately  we amortize intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of million as of december   over estimated useful lives of five to ten years 
acquired contracts  with a gross carrying amount of million are being amortized over ten years  primarily on an accelerated basis intended to reflect the cash flow patterns and duration used in estimating the value of those contracts 
a reduction in the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets would result in additional amortization expense on a prospective basis 
additionally  we review all indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill of million  for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
in any period that we determine the carrying amount of our intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value will be charged to expense 
we maintain reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  such as signage  equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  we may need to decrease our estimate of the market value of our inventory and  as a result  increase our reserves 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe we will realize 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will be required to reduce our deferred tax assets and charge the amount of the reduction to expense in the period in which we make the determination 
similarly  if we determine that we will realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  we would increase income in the period in which we make the determination 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for our first quarter beginning january  and apply to all awards granted  modified or cancelled after that date  and to the portion of previously granted awards that have not vested by the adoption date 
we will adopt sfas r on january  on a prospective basis using the modified prospective transition method 
we do not expect the amortization of expense relating to previously granted awards to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the accounting for the reporting of voluntary changes in accounting principles 
sfas requires changes in accounting principles to be applied retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  where practicable  unless specific transition provisions permit alternative transition methods 
sfas will be effective in fiscal years beginning after december  our adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements except to the extent that we adopt a voluntary change in accounting principle in a future period that must be accounted for through a restatement of previous financial statements
