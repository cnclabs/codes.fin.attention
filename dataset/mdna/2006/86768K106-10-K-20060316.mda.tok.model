unless the context suggests otherwise  references herein to sunrise  the company  we  us and our mean sunrise senior living  inc and our consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a provider of senior living services in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and germany 
founded in  we began with a simple but innovative vision to create an alternative senior living option that would emphasize quality of life and quality of care 
we offer a full range of personalized senior living services  from independent living  to assisted living  to care for individuals with alzheimer s and other forms of memory loss  to nursing and rehabilitative care 
we also develop senior living communities for ourselves  for ventures in which we retain an ownership interest and for third parties 
our long range strategic objective is to grow our senior living business through a management services business model that is built on long term management contracts 
our four primary growth drivers consist of generating revenue growth from our existing operating portfolio of owned and managed communities  adding additional communities through new construction  primarily with venture partners  adding management contracts through selective acquisitions and generating revenue through the deployment of assets on our balance sheet 
at december   we operated communities  including communities in the united states  communities in canada  five communities in the united kingdom and two communities in germany  with a total resident capacity of approximately  we own or have an ownership interest in of these communities and are managed for third parties 
in  we added management of communities which we own or in which we have an ownership interest  including communities acquired from the acquisition of assets from the fountains  an arizona based owner and operator of senior living communities the fountains 
the communities added a combined resident capacity for over  residents 
we also added management of new communities owned by independent third parties  including through management contracts acquired from the acquisition of greystone communities  inc greystone 
as part of the acquisition of assets from the fountains  we also acquired management of an existing community which we lease to a third party 
in  third party owners terminated of our management contracts 
there were also three communities held in unconsolidated ventures that were sold to third parties in at december   we provided pre opening management and professional services to communities under construction  of which communities are in the united states  one community is in canada  ten communities are in the united kingdom  and six communities are in germany  with a combined capacity for over  residents 
we own of eight of these communities  seven of which are expected to be sold to sunrise senior living real estate investment trust sunrise reit  an independent entity we established in canada during to acquire  own and invest in income producing senior living communities in canada and the united states 
in  we began construction on new communities  of which are in the united states  six are in the united kingdom  four are in germany and one is in canada 
management of communities we manage and operate communities that are wholly owned by us  communities that are owned by unconsolidated ventures in which we have a minority ownership interest and communities that are wholly owned by third parties 
for the communities that we manage for unconsolidated ventures and third parties  we typically are paid a management fee of approximately five to eight percent of the community s revenue 
in addition  in certain management contracts  we have the opportunity to earn incentive management fees based on monthly or yearly operating or cash flow results 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of operating deficit credit facilities and credit support arrangements provided to certain of our unconsolidated ventures or third party owners 
for the communities that we operate that are wholly owned  we receive resident fees 
development of communities in order to grow the operating portfolio that we manage  we also develop senior living communities 
we typically develop senior living communities in partnership with others 
we also develop wholly owned senior living communities for ourselves and that we expect to contribute to ventures and other third party owners  usually before construction is completed 
we believe we have maintained a disciplined approach to site selection and refinement of our operating model  first introduced over years ago  and are constantly searching for ways to improve our communities 
we enter into development ventures in order to reduce our initial capital requirements  while enabling us to enter into long term management agreements that are intended to provide us with a continuing stream of revenue 
additionally  these development ventures allow us to reduce the risk of our international expansion  which we conduct through ventures  with the assistance of knowledgeable international partners 
when development is undertaken in partnership with others  our venture partners provide significant cash equity investments  and we take a minority interest in such ventures 
additionally  non recourse third party construction debt is obtained to provide the majority of funds necessary to complete development 
in addition to third party debt  we may provide financing necessary to complete the construction for these development ventures 
these loans are included in notes receivable affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets and were million at december  this financing is provided at negotiated prevailing market interest rates 
at december   there were communities under construction held in unconsolidated ventures 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of limited debt guarantees provided to certain of our development ventures 
we receive consideration from our development ventures for pre opening services related to site selection  zoning  and design 
services provided prior to transferring the land to a venture or a third party for further development are recognized in other income pre opened communities in our consolidated statements of income 
services provided for construction supervision  employee selection  licensing  training and marketing efforts after the land has been transferred are recognized as operating revenue and are included in management and professional services pre opened communities in the consolidated statements of income 
as we are minority owners in these development ventures  we only record the pre opening income associated with the third party ownership percentage in the venture 
for example  when our venture partner has a ownership interest in the venture  we recognize of the pre opening revenue earned 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of development completion guarantees provided to certain of our development ventures 
from time to time we also develop wholly owned senior living communities 
at december   we had eight wholly owned communities under construction with a resident capacity of over  residents 
we expect these communities to be contributed to a venture or third party before construction is completed or  in some cases  upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy 
we provide funding for the construction not otherwise financed by construction loans and capitalize the development costs associated with construction prior to the contribution of the development community to a venture or third party owner 
for equity investees that remain wholly owned  we recognize initial operating losses during the initial one to two years prior to the community achieving stabilization 
we are committed to this investment in costs and expenses because we have historically been able to create significant value through the successful development and operation of prototype communities 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize off balance sheet arrangements in the form of real estate ventures 
we believe that we reduce the risk to our stockholders related to real estate ownership and receive potential upside from the sale of a venture by owning a minority interest in the real estate underlying our long term management contracts 
these real estate ventures significantly reduce the amount of capital required by us to develop new communities 
as part of our operating strategy  we may be required to provide some level of guarantees to these ventures  including limited debt guarantees and operating deficit guarantees 
in addition  with respect to development ventures  we may provide financing necessary to complete the construction and we often provide development completion guarantees in the event actual costs of development exceed the approved budget

developments acquisitions greystone communities  inc in may  we acquired of the equity interests in greystone  a developer and manager of continuing care retirement communities ccrcs 
through the acquisition of greystone  we expanded into the not for profit sector  which is the largest segment of the ccrc industry 
the acquisition of greystone included management of operating ccrcs capacity for over  residents  pre opening and ongoing management of an additional communities capacity for over  residents that greystone had under development for not for profit owners  as well as various other consulting and marketing agreements 
we paid million for greystone and incurred approximately million of transaction costs 
we may also pay up to an additional million if greystone meets certain performance milestones in   and for a total potential acquisition cost of million  subject to various adjustments as set forth in the acquisition agreement 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
the purchase price values preliminarily assigned are as follows in millions net working capital deficit property and equipment  net management and development contracts goodwill total purchase price including transaction costs the portion of the purchase price allocated to management contracts will be amortized over the specific term of each individual management contract acquired which ranges from one to years 
the fountains in july  we contributed approximately million in cash in exchange for a interest in an unconsolidated venture formed to purchase assets from the fountains  an arizona based owner and operator of senior living communities 
our venture partner contributed approximately million in cash in exchange for an interest in the venture 
concurrent with its funding  the venture paid approximately million in cash to acquire senior living communities owned or controlled by the fountains

the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
the purchase price values preliminarily assigned are as follows in millions net working capital deficit property and equipment  net management contracts goodwill other assets total purchase price including transaction costs we also agreed to pay the venture million over months for the right to enter into long term management contracts with each of the communities acquired by the venture 
the transactions surrounding the entire portfolio provide us management for more than  additional units in states 
termination of management contracts in november  five star quality care  inc five star terminated management contracts for which we were the manager 
we recognized an million buy out fee and an additional million for management fees which would have been earned from november  through december  we also wrote off the related remaining million unamortized management contract intangible asset 
in february  five star terminated an additional long term management contract and we received a termination fee of million 
five star s right to terminate these contracts was not related to our performance at any of these communities 
in  other third party owners terminated eight additional management contracts for which we were the manager 
the third party owners right to terminate these contracts was not related to our performance at any of these communities 
redemption of convertible notes in february  we completed the redemption of our remaining convertible subordinated notes due february  prior to the redemption date  all but  of the approximately million principal amount of the notes outstanding were converted into approximately million shares of common stock 
the conversion price was per share in accordance with the terms of the indenture agreement governing the notes 
new corporate credit facility in december  we replaced our previous corporate credit facility with a new million credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the million credit facility provides for both cash borrowings and letters of credit 
it has an initial term of four years with an extension option 
the million credit facility also permits cash borrowings and letters of credit in currencies other than us dollars 
borrowings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including investments  acquisitions and the refinancing of existing debt 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries that manage  own and develop senior living communities 
variable interest entities vies in which we have an interest are consolidated when we have been identified as the primary beneficiary 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments in ventures in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not have control are accounted for using the equity method 
we hold an interest in ventures established to develop or acquire and own senior living communities 
when these ventures are considered to be variable interest entities vies in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  we consolidate the ventures if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary 
when we have determined we are not the primary beneficiary and we determine that we own a non controlling interest because other partners or members control or participate in the management decisions of these ventures  the investments are accounted for under the equity method 
the equity method investments are recorded at cost and subsequently are adjusted for equity in net income losses and distributions 
we determine our share of the investees earnings or losses based on the distributions of cash flow from a hypothetical liquidation of the investee s assets and liabilities 
the equity earnings are adjusted for the impact on the investee s reported earnings  if any  for the basis differences between our carrying value of the equity investments and the investee s underlying assets 
we recognize profits on sales of services to these ventures to the extent of the ventures outside ownership interest 
we owned interests in unconsolidated senior living communities of which are under development through ownership interests in unconsolidated ventures at december  that are accounted for under the equity method and one unconsolidated venture accounted for under the cost method 
those ventures are generally limited liability companies and partnerships 
our interest in those ventures generally range from five to 
we have one community in which we own less than  communities in which we own between and  communities in which we own between and  and communities in which we own more than 
we generally do not have future requirements to contribute additional capital over and above the original capital commitments 
the unconsolidated ventures obtain non recourse third party debt 
our total investment in these ventures is comprised of our capital investment in these ventures and  when agreed to  subordinated debt and other short term advances provided 
at december   the total investment in the unconsolidated ventures was million not including any guarantees provided to these ventures as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the realization of these investments is dependent upon the ongoing operations of the ventures 
our underlying equity in the net assets of the investees exceeded the carrying value of the investments by million and million at december  and  respectively 
we had an ownership interest in ventures that are considered vies at december  we are the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidate eight of these vies 
seven of these consolidated vies are development communities in which we have a majority of the voting interest and are developing for sunrise reit 
at december   included in our consolidated balance sheet were million of development costs and million of debt  including million of third party construction debt secured by the development communities and million of borrowings from sunrise reit guaranteed by us 
the only recourse to us with respect to these seven vies is under borrowings from sunrise reit 
the remaining consolidated vie is sunrise at home senior living services  inc sunrise at home  a venture between us and two third parties 
the venture offers home health services by highly trained staff members in customers own homes and has annual revenue in excess of million 
prior to december  we accounted for our minority interest in sunrise at home as an equity method investment 
in december  we wrote down our interests in the venture by million 
also  the venture was recapitalized with million of additional equity received equally from the original controlling partner  a new independent partner and us 
as of the recapitalization  we were determined to be the primary beneficiary and began consolidating this venture 
we have included million of net working capital related to the venture in the consolidated balance sheet 
we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the remaining three vies and  therefore  account for these investments under the equity method of accounting 
two of these vies are development ventures and one is an operating venture 
one of the two development ventures was formed in april for the development of a senior living community in washington  dc  which was operating at december  with total assets of million and annual revenue of million in the other development venture was formed in september for the development of a luxury senior living community in bethesda  maryland  which was under development at december  with total assets of million 
the operating venture was formed with sunrise reit in december and contains five operating communities recapitalized from a development venture  eight operating communities recapitalized from a sale manage back venture and two operating communities previously wholly owned by us 
this operating venture had total assets of million at december  and annual revenue of million in our maximum loss exposure from these three non consolidated vies was million at december  long lived assets property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and primarily include costs directly related to the development and construction of communities 
if a project is abandoned  any costs previously capitalized are expensed 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected cash flows are not sufficient to recover its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its undiscounted expected cash flows  an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets relate primarily to the acquisition of marriott senior living services msls  karrington health  inc  greystone and the fountains and are comprised of management contracts  leaseholds and goodwill 
in determining the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired  we make estimates of the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets using information obtained as a result of pre acquisition due diligence  marketing  leasing activities and independent appraisals 
management contracts and leaseholds are valued using expected discounted cash flows and are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining contract term  ranging from one to years 
the carrying amounts of management contracts and leaseholds are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are identified 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill represents the costs of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
we conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in the fourth quarter 
for our impairment analysis  we considered greystone acquired in may as a separate reporting unit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we tested each reporting unit for possible impairment by comparing each reporting unit s net book value to its fair value 
because each reporting unit s fair value was greater than its net book value and no other impairment indicators existed  further impairment tests were not deemed necessary 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purpose of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these reporting units 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
if actual results are different from our forecasts  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill  which could result in non cash charges  adversely affecting our results of operations 
loss reserves for certain self insured programs we offer a variety of insurance programs to the communities we operate 
these programs include property  general and professional liability  excess umbrella liability  crime  automobile liability and physical damage  workers compensation and employers liability and employment practices liability insurance program 
each community we operate is charged its proportionate share of the cost of the insurance program 
we utilize large deductible blanket insurance programs in order to contain costs for our workers compensation risk and for our general and professional liability risks 
the design and purpose of a large deductible insurance program is to reduce overall premium and claim costs by internally financing lower cost claims that are predictable from year to year  while buying insurance only for higher cost  less predictable claims 
workers compensation and general professional liability insurance prior to september   we had been fully insured for general and professional liability costs with third party insurers 
accordingly  to the extent claims are covered under these policies  we have no exposure for claims prior to that date 
subsequently  we self insured a portion of community general and professional liability and workers compensation risks through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  sunrise senior living insurance  inc sunrise captive  which is funded with premiums paid by each community 
sunrise captive pays costs for each claim above a community deductible up to a per claim limit 
third party insurers cover claim costs above this limit 
these third party insurers carry an am best rating of a vii or better 
we accrued million and million at december  and  respectively  for the estimated costs of general and professional liability and workers compensation claims outstanding 
these balances are classified as current liabilities and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record outstanding losses and expenses for both general and professional liability and workers compensation based on the recommendations of an independent actuary and management s judgment 
we believe that the allowance for outstanding losses and expenses is appropriate to cover the ultimate cost of losses incurred at december   but the allowance may ultimately be settled for a greater or lesser amount 
any subsequent changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
employee health benefits we offer employees an option to participate in a self insured health plan 
the cost of our employee health benefits  net of employee contributions  is shared by us and the managed unconsolidated communities based on the respective number of participants working directly for us or the unconsolidated communities 
funds collected are used to pay the actual program costs 
costs include estimated annual claims  third party administration fees  network provider fees  communication costs  and other related administration costs incurred by us 
although claims under this plan are self insured  we have aggregate protection which caps the potential liability for both individual and total claims during a plan year 
claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we also maintain a reserve for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
this reserve is based on the historical claim reporting lag and payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self insured health plan is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
revenue recognition operating revenue management and professional services operating communities is comprised of fees from operating communities owned by unconsolidated ventures and third parties  which consist of base management fees  incentive management fees  consulting fees and termination fees 
the management fees are generally between five and eight percent of a managed community s total operating revenue 
fees are recognized in the month they are earned in accordance with the terms of the management contract 
in addition  changes in estimates for credit support payments made to certain communities are recorded as a reduction to revenue as management fees are also being recorded related to these same communities 
community contract services reimbursement is comprised of reimbursable expenses such as payroll  utilities and other operating expenses from unconsolidated communities operated by our employees under long term management agreements which are recognized when services are provided 
the related expenses are included in reimbursable community contract services 
management and professional services pre opened communities is comprised of fees received for services provided prior to the opening of an unconsolidated community 
these fees are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin and eitf fees related to building design and construction oversite are recognized using the percentage of completion method and the portion related to marketing services is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period the services are provided 
the cost to cost method is used to measure the extent of progress toward completion for purposes of calculating the percentage of completion portion of the revenues 
resident fees are earned for the delivery of senior living services to residents at our consolidated communities 
residents  their families  other responsible parties and medicare medicaid typically are billed monthly 
approximately  and  of our resident fee revenue was derived from private pay sources in  and  respectively 
the remaining resident fee revenue was derived from medicare medicaid 
resident fees are earned for services including basic care  skilled nursing care  community fees  extended levels of care  reminiscence care and other resident related services 
resident fees are recognized monthly as services are provided 
agreements with residents are generally for a term of one year and are cancelable by residents with thirty days notice 
other income operating communities other income operating communities is recognized upon the sale of communities operated by us 
operating contingencies may require us to defer a portion of the gain until such operating contingencies are satisfied 
if the operating contingencies are not met for an identified period  we would be required to repay a portion of the cash proceeds related to the specific contingency and would not recognize the portion of the gain associated with that contingency 
other income pre opened communities we customarily provide pre opening services for development property we hold prior to transferring the property to a venture or a third party for further development 
we generally receive consideration for these pre opening services  improvements and land in connection with the sale of the property 
results of operations we currently derive our consolidated operating revenues from the following sources management and professional services provided to operating and pre opened communities for unconsolidated ventures and other third party owners  community contract services reimbursement which represents the reimbursement of community contract services expense  and resident fees for the delivery of senior living services to our consolidated communities 
operating expenses are classified into the following categories reimbursable community contract services from unconsolidated ventures and other third party owners  management and professional services pre opened communities for site selection  zoning  community design  construction management and financing incurred for development communities  community operating expense which includes labor  food  marketing and other direct community expenses for our consolidated communities  community lease for rental expenses at our consolidated communities  general and administrative expense related to headquarters and regional staff expenses and other administrative costs  and depreciation and amortization

in  we continued to capitalize on our brand and management services experience by entering into new management and professional services contracts internationally and domestically 
the number of communities managed for unconsolidated ventures and other third party owners increased from in to in  or 
in  we added management of communities which we own or in which we have an ownership interest  including communities acquired from the acquisition of assets from the fountains 
we also added management of new communities owned by independent third parties  including management contracts acquired from the acquisition of greystone 
as part of the acquisition of assets from the fountains  we also acquired management of an existing community which we lease to a third party 
additionally  management contracts were terminated and one of our unconsolidated ventures sold its three senior living communities two of the communities were sold to another unconsolidated venture in which we have an ownership interest and one of the communities was sold to sunrise reit 
we continue to manage these three communities under long term management agreements 
the number of communities managed for unconsolidated ventures and other third party owners increased by in compared to in  we began operating nine additional communities which we lease or in which we have an ownership interest  and began managing seven new communities owned by independent third parties

the same community average daily resident fee for senior living communities that we owned or had an ownership interest in and that were stabilized in the fourth quarter of and communities was and  respectively 
stabilized communities are those that have been operated by us for at least months  or that have achieved occupancy percentages of or above 
net income increased to million in  or per share diluted from million  or per share diluted in the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in management and professional services operating communities revenue of million  which includes million received from five star in connection with the termination of management contracts  and also an increase in management and professional services pre opened communities revenue attributed to contributions from our acquisition of greystone and our accelerated development efforts 
this was offset by increases in management and professional services pre opened communities expense which corresponds to the increased contributions from greystone and our accelerated development efforts  depreciation and amortization expense  which includes accelerated amortization of million with respect to the terminated five star management contracts  and an anticipated reduction in other income operating communities of million

in addition  we deferred million until certain contingencies were met 
we recognized million in related to the satisfaction of certain contingencies for communities sold in other income pre opened communities decreased million in and increased million in  respectively  compared to the prior years 
in two related transactions consummated in september and december  we sold a development community to an unconsolidated venture in which we have a combined ownership interest and recognized million 
in  we sold six development communities to two unconsolidated ventures and recognized million 
in  we sold one development community to an unconsolidated venture with sunrise reit in which we have a ownership interest and recognized million and a foreign currency exchange gain of million while holding the related intercompany loans and advances 
in  we sold development communities to six unconsolidated ventures and recognized million 
we also sold three communities to third party owners and recognized million 
in  we sold five development communities to three unconsolidated ventures and recognized million 
we also sold five communities to third party owners and recognized million 
other non operating income compared to interest expense decreased million in compared to as a result of additional capitalized interest from increased development activity 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt was and at december  and  respectively 
interest incurred is expected to decrease in due to the conversion of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in february in  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our investment in sunrise reit debentures  and a foreign currency exchange gain of million while holding the related intercompany loans and advances 
compared to interest expense decreased million in compared to as a result of a million reduction in debt in the weighted average interest rate on our debt was and at december  and  respectively 
equity in earnings and return on investment in unconsolidated senior living communities equity in earnings and return on investment in unconsolidated senior living communities represents our allocation of the results of operations and returns on our investments from the distributions of proceeds from transactions with our unconsolidated ventures 
compared to equity in earnings and return on investment in unconsolidated senior living communities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or  which was primarily comprised of million return on our investment pursuant to the terms of a venture agreement  a decrease of million from our portion of start up losses associated with two international development ventures 
in  these two ventures opened four communities which incurred losses in  million return on our investment whereby an unconsolidated venture sold two senior living communities to sunrise reit  million return on our investment whereby an unconsolidated venture sold its three senior living communities and distributed the proceeds to its members 
we recognized the million of cash received in excess of our investment 
a decrease of million from the write down of our interest in sunrise at home  and a decrease of million from the results of operations from other unconsolidated ventures  including our portion of start up losses from development ventures 
compared to equity in earnings and return on investment in unconsolidated senior living communities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or  which primarily resulted from improved operations and additional incentive fees 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in our effective tax rates are primarily related to the amount of us federal work opportunity tax credits 
realization of the deferred tax asset of million and million at december  and  respectively  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
we expect to fully utilize the loss carryforwards prior to expiration 
liquidity and capital resources overview we had million of working capital at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
in addition  we had million available under our credit facilities at december  included in working capital were million and million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and  respectively 
the change in working capital was primarily due to million increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  primarily from termination fees received in  million increase in the current portion of notes receivable affiliates  and million net increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred income taxes  off set by million increase in accrued expenses related to increased accrued salaries and insurance reserves  and million in current maturities of long term debt  primarily from borrowings from sunrise reit 
as we have used all of our us federal operating loss carryforwards  we expect to make federal income tax payments of approximately million in to date  we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations  both short term and long term borrowings and proceeds from the sale of communities pursuant to our sale long term manage back program 
we currently estimate that our existing credit facilities  together with existing working capital  cash flows from operations  financing commitments and financing expected to be available will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs during the next months  including communities currently under construction 
additional financing will  however  be required to complete additional development and to refinance existing indebtedness 
we estimate that it will cost approximately million to complete the communities we currently have under construction 
we expect these costs will be recovered when these communities are contributed to unconsolidated ventures before construction is completed  or in some circumstances  upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy 
we have entered into contracts to purchase and lease additional sites 
we expect to develop the majority of the sites under purchase contracts within ventures 
this business model limits the amount of capital required of us to complete the development of the communities 
we expect that cash flows from operations  together with borrowings under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our investment in the development and construction of these additional communities for at least the next months 
we expect from time to time to seek additional funding through public or private financing sources  including equity or debt financing 
we can provide no assurance that such financing and refinancing will be available on acceptable terms 
long term debt at december   we had million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of  including million of convertible subordinated notes 
of the million of outstanding debt  we had million of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of and million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
in february  we redeemed all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes that had not been converted at that time 
at december   we had million of debt that is due within the next months 
of this amount  million relates to ten wholly owned communities 
this debt is mortgage financing  most of which we intend to refinance or extend in the remaining million represents borrowings under a credit facility 
on december   we entered into a million secured corporate credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the credit facility replaces our former credit facility 
the million credit facility provides for both cash borrowings and letters of credit 
it has an initial term of four years with an extension option 
cash borrowings in us dollars accrue interest at libor plus to plus a fee to participating lenders subject to certain european banking regulations or the base rate the higher of the federal funds rate plus and prime plus to 
the million credit facility also permits cash borrowings and letters of credit in currencies other than us dollars 
interest on cash borrowings in non us currencies accrue at the rate of the banking federation of the european union for the euro plus to 
letters of credit fees are equal to to of the maximum available to be drawn on the letters of credit 
we pay commitment fees of on the unused balance of the credit facility 
borrowings are used for general corporate purposes including investments  acquisitions and the refinancing of existing debt 
there were million of letters of credit and no cash advances outstanding under this credit facility at december  the letters of credit have been pledged primarily for the benefit of insurance companies  lenders and certain municipalities and were unused at december  the letters of credit issued under the million corporate credit facility expire within one year 
our debt instruments contain various financial covenants and other restrictions  including provisions that require us to meet certain financial tests for example  our million line of credit requires us not to exceed certain leverage ratios  to maintain certain fixed charge coverage ratios and to have a consolidated net worth of at least million as adjusted each quarter and to meet other financial ratios  require consent for changes in control  and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of all or substantially all assets  or engage in mergers or other business combinations in which we are not the surviving entity  without lender consent 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
debt guarantees and financing obligations as part of our operating strategy  we may provide debt guarantees to certain of our ventures 
unless otherwise stated  we would be required to perform under a debt guarantee if the venture failed to perform under the debt agreement and the bank pursued our guarantee 
also as part of our operating strategy  we may undertake certain financing obligations in connection with acquisitions 
the following table sets forth our debt guarantees and other obligations at december  dollars in thousands number of amount communities debt guarantees development ventures other ventures other obligations entrance fees other at december   we provided million of debt guarantees to ventures  which represents our maximum exposure 
of the million in debt guarantees to development ventures  will terminate in december  million will be removed upon achieving certain debt service coverage targets and the remaining million will remain in place throughout the terms of the loans 
of the million in debt guarantees to other unconsolidated ventures  million relates to hospital partnerships and million relates to acquisition partnerships that remain in place throughout the terms of the loans 
the remaining million relates to an operating venture and will be removed when or if certain occupancy and debt service coverage targets are met 
to date  we have not been required to fund any debt guarantees 
we have remaining million in financing obligations at december  associated with management contracts acquired from msls in march in connection with this transaction  cnl retirement properties  inc cnl agreed to assume the obligation to repay entrance fees issued by msls with respect to two continuing care retirement communities 
to the extent that cnl fails to satisfy this obligation  we would be required to repay this obligation  the majority of which is expected to be refinanced with proceeds from the issuance of entrance fees as new residents enter the communities 
we have provided an additional million financing obligation related to the acquisition of msls which is comprised of an obligation to provide financing under existing credit facilities to four communities 
at december   we do not believe that we will be required to fund any amounts related to these debt guarantees and obligations 
development completion guarantees we typically guarantee that communities developed in ventures or with third parties will be completed at budgeted costs approved by all partners 
budgeted costs generally include contingency reserves for unforeseen costs and potential overruns 
we would be required to fund these guarantees if the actual costs of development exceeded the approved budgeted costs 
for some ventures  such guarantees are subject to pooling whereby cost overruns and cost savings are pooled to determine our funding commitment 
at december   communities were under construction and subject to completion guarantees 
we have over years experience in the development and construction of senior living communities 
our construction contractors are experienced in building and developing senior living communities and assume much of the risk of on time and on budget completion by executing guaranteed fixed price contracts 
the terms of these guarantees generally provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments 
we paid million in under the development completion guarantees 
no amounts were paid in we expect to make payments of million in related to two development communities  million of which will be an interest bearing loan to the venture and the remaining million was recorded in as a reduction of management and professional services pre opened communities revenue as the funds are being drawn as revenues are being recognized 
the following table sets forth our estimated liability under development completion guarantees at december  dollars in thousands number of communities expected payout development completion guarantees operating deficit credit facilities as part of certain management contracts  we may provide an operating deficit credit facility to cover cash shortfalls of monthly expenses after operating reserves have been depleted 
if we are required to fund under a facility  amounts funded either become loans to the venture or are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
the credit facilities are generally in place for a limited period of time until the community reaches stabilization  there is no limit on the potential future payments  and repayment is due when the community has adequate operating cash flows or is sold 
at december   operating communities were subject to an operating deficit credit facility and additional communities will be subject to an operating credit facility upon opening 
we funded million to two communities in which was recorded as a reduction of management and professional services pre opened communities revenue 
we expect to fund an additional million in and such amounts will become loans when funded 
the following table sets forth our estimated liability under operating deficit credit facilities at december  dollars in thousands number of communities expected payout operating communities other commitments the following table sets forth our estimated liability under other commitments at december  dollars in thousands number of communities expected payout credit support agreements commitments to advance funds liquidity support agreement we have provided credit support agreements to certain communities that we have developed or for which we have acquired management contracts with a significant opportunity for occupancy improvements 
generally  credit support agreements are provided for limited periods of time and require funding if operating cash flows or returns to investors are below stated targets 
for communities sold by us  a reserve may be established from the transaction proceeds to fund these potential payments in connection with the sale 
if payments are not recoverable as a loan  a liability is recorded for the estimated payments to be made at the commitment date 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the estimated liability based on the operating results of the community and the terms of the agreement 
if it is probable that we will be required to fund additional amounts than previously estimated  the additional amounts are recorded as a reduction of management and professional services operating communities revenue 
at december   we had communities that were subject to credit support arrangements that terminate within six to ten months 
we expect to fund million in and such amounts have been accrued at december  at december   we have commitments to advance funds to communities  the longest of which is for less than two years 
advances under these commitments are recoverable as loans and are generally repayable to us from operating cash flows and or proceeds from the sale of the community 
we expect to fund million in under these commitments 
in connection with the fountains transaction  we agreed to a liquidity support agreement for scheduled debt service payments with respect to the fountains loan 
under the terms of the liquidity support agreement  we would be required to perform if the venture failed to make scheduled debt service payments under the fountains loan and the bank pursued our guarantee 
our maximum exposure under this liquidity support agreement is million in the event the venture does not make any of its required debt service payments and the fountains loan is extended to its full term of seven years 
based on the projected operations of the communities  we do not expect to make any payments under the liquidity support agreement 
the liquidity support agreement remains in place for up to seven years 
no amounts were paid in we have also guaranteed a million obligation of an unconsolidated international venture under a land purchase contract 
contractual obligations our current contractual obligations include long term debt  operating leases for our corporate and regional offices  operating leases for of our communities  contracts to purchase land  and four contracts to lease land 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our contractual obligations 
principal maturities of long term debt  future minimum lease payments  and amounts due on land purchases and lease commitments at december  are as follows in thousands payment due by period more less than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases land purchase contracts land lease commitments total long term debt includes maturities and interest obligations 
we anticipate future development to occur in ventures and expect to be reimbursed for the majority of the land purchase contracts and land lease costs by our capital partners when the development ventures are formed 
cash flows our primary sources of cash from operating activities are the collection of management and professional services fees from operating and pre opened communities  collection of monthly fees and other billings from services provided to residents of our consolidated communities  and distributions of operating earnings from unconsolidated ventures 
the primary uses of cash for our ongoing operations include the payment of community operating expenses for our consolidated and managed communities 
changes in operating assets and liabilities such as accounts receivable  prepaids and other current assets  and accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate based on the timing of payment to vendors 
reimbursement for these costs from our managed communities will vary as some costs are pre funded  such as payroll  while others are reimbursed after they are incurred 
therefore  there will not always be a correlation between increases and decreases of accounts payable and receivables for our managed communities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
in  cash flows provided by operations consisted primarily of net earnings  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts receivable 
these were partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses  due from unconsolidated senior living communities and other current assets 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was a result of increased self insurance program reserves  accrued salaries and other accounts payable and accruals 
in  cash flows provided by operations consisted primarily of net earnings  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in prepaid expenses  due from unconsolidated senior living communities and other current assets

net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in activities included additional borrowings of million and million  offset by debt repayments of million and million in and  respectively 
the additional borrowings under our credit facility were used to fund our continued development of senior living communities and refinance existing debt 
we repurchased approximately million of our common stock and received proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options in we repurchased approximately million of our common stock and received proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options in stock repurchase programs in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock up to an aggregate purchase price of million over the subsequent months 
in may  our board of directors expanded the repurchase program to an aggregate purchase price of million to repurchase outstanding shares of common stock and or our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in march  our board of directors authorized the additional repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock and or our outstanding convertible subordinated notes up to an aggregate purchase price of million 
at december   each of these preceding authorizations had expired to the extent not utilized 
in november  our board of directors approved a new repurchase plan that provides for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and or the outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
this plan extends through december there were no repurchases during the three months ended december  we repurchased outstanding shares of our common stock under these plans  as follows repurchase of common stock shares average price total at december  market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through variable rate debt  variable rate notes receivable and variable rate bonds 
the table below details by category the principal amount  the average interest rate and the estimated fair market value of our notes receivable  investments  and debt 
the fair value estimates for the notes receivable are based on the estimates of management and on currently prevailing rates for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity

sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we will adopt sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method and accordingly  the financial statements for prior periods will not reflect any restated amounts 
while we have not finalized our analysis  we believe the impact of adopting the new standard will result in additional compensation expense of between million and million 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
eitf provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership that is not a vie and thus should consolidate the limited partnership 
the effective date is june  for all new or modified limited partnerships and fiscal years beginning after december  for all other limited partnerships 
we adopted eitf for new ventures formed after june  and there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently do not anticipate a significant impact as a result of adopting eitf for unconsolidated ventures formed prior to june  impact of inflation management fees from communities operated by us for third parties and resident fees from owned senior living communities are significant sources of our revenue 
these revenues are affected by daily resident fee rates and community occupancy rates 
the rates charged for the delivery of senior living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the communities operate 
in addition  employee compensation expense is the principal cost element of community operations 
employee compensation  including salary and benefit increases and the hiring of additional staff to support our growth initiatives  have previously had a negative impact on operating margins and may again do so in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our resident agreements are for terms of one year  but are terminable by the resident at any time upon days notice  and allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the daily fees payable  and thus may enable us to seek increases in daily fees due to inflation or other factors 
any increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy of our communities 
we believe  however  that the short term nature of our resident agreements generally serves to reduce the risk to us of the adverse effect of inflation 
there can be no assurance that resident fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes
