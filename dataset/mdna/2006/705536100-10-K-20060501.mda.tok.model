the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k 
highlights consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  a increase from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher engineering services revenues and product licensing fees 
engineering services revenues increased in fiscal year due primarily to the kyocera mita mou that was signed in the first quarter of fiscal year and resulted in approximately million in revenues 
product licensing revenues also increased as a result of increased demand for oem s products containing our technology offerings  which includes networking and adobe postscript 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  including million of block licenses  an increase of from the previous fiscal year 
twelve block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  million of which was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the remaining million will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year hardware sales increased during fiscal year due primarily to million in sales of the everest controller 
although the everest controller sales were discontinued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  those sales did validate our high performance color technologies in the market place 

table of contents engineering services and maintenance contract backlog at january  was approximately million  this compares to million as of january  the contract backlog at january  does not include additional amounts expected under the kyocera mita mou nor does it include amounts expected under the pmc sierra design win that was signed subsequent to january  general we generate revenue from our oems through the sale of imaging solutions in either turnkey or sdk form 
historically  oem demand for turnkey solutions had exceeded demand for sdk solutions 
however  beginning in fiscal year  we experienced a shift in demand away from turnkey solutions towards demand for sdks  particularly for our mature monochrome solutions 
we have attempted to expand our high performance color solutions by seamlessly incorporating our networking technologies and related imaging technologies licensed from third parties 
our product licensing revenues are comprised of both recurring per unit and block licensing revenues and development licensing fees for source code or sdks 
licensing revenues are derived from per unit fees paid periodically by our oem customers upon manufacturing and subsequent commercial shipment of products incorporating our technology 
licensing revenues are also derived from arrangements in which we enable third party technology  such as solutions from adobe or novell  to be used with our and or our oem partners products 
block licenses are per unit licenses made in large volume quantities to an oem for products either in or about to enter into distribution into the marketplace 
payment schedules for block licenses are negotiable and payment terms are often dependent on the size of the block and other terms and conditions of the block license being acquired 
typically  payments are made in either one lump sum or over a period of four or more quarters 
revenue received for block licenses is recognized in accordance with sop  which requires that revenue be recognized after acceptance by the oem and if fees are fixed and determinable and the collection of fees is probable 
for block licenses that have a significant portion of the payments due within twelve months  revenue is recognized at the time the block license becomes effective 
we also have engineering services revenues that are derived primarily from adapting our software and supporting electronics to specific oem requirements 
we provide our engineering services to oems seeking a turnkey imaging solution for their digital document products 
our maintenance revenues are derived from software maintenance agreements 
maintenance revenues currently constitute a small portion of total revenue 
as part of the total solution offered to our oems  we developed a direct distribution channel for our asic chips 
under this fabless model  we supply asic chips from the foundry directly to the oems through third party distributors  which include arrow electronics and marubun corporation 
we are responsible for marketing and sales administration  including the billings and collections to and from our oems and distributors  and the third party is responsible for the coordination of production with the foundry  maintenance of necessary inventories and providing just in time delivery to oems and distributors 
we derive revenues from the sale of controllers for mfp devices 
we sell our controllers to certain oem dealers for distribution to end users 
because it is a relatively new product  we have been unable to establish a history regarding returns of the products shipped 
therefore  we recognizes revenue only upon sales through to end users 
historically  a limited number of customers have provided a substantial portion of our revenues 
therefore  the availability and successful closing of new contracts  or modifications and additions to existing contracts with these customers may materially impact our financial position and results of operations from quarter to quarter 
our technology has addressed the worldwide market for monochrome printers pages per minute and mfp pages per minute 
this market has been consolidating  and the demand for the monochrome technology and products offered by us declined throughout fiscal year we believe that unit 
table of contents volume for these types of printers will grow at lower rates than in past years 
available data indicate that retail prices are declining in these segments 
there has been a decline in the number of monochrome contracts that we have with oems under which we are currently performing services and granting licenses  and this decline is likely to continue along with the demand for the monochrome technology and products we presently offer 
competitors have merged into larger business units with the resulting strength to acquire and impose a competitive advantage in our market segments 
while sales increased during fiscal year  oems have continued to reduce the absolute number of new products being developed and in some instances  oems have preferred to perform in house development projects for the products that they are developing and or planning to launch 
although there have been fewer opportunities for us to sell our turnkey services and sdks  we continue to support our current oem controller customers in the digital printing devices business with our existing and new technologies 
in response to our belief that the demand for our core monochrome offerings may grow at lower rates than in past years and that we may continue to meet sales resistance from our customers  we have developed and commercialized high performance color imaging and printing technologies and a new open architecture named peerless sierra technologies 
we believe that our products based on peerless sierra technologies address key growth areas in the imaging market including increased demand for color imaging  the emergence of mfps  and continued demand for faster low cost monochrome printing solutions 
during the last fiscal year  we launched a new mfp controller product  everest  containing peerless sierra technologies  into the marketplace and during fiscal year the everest controller generated million in revenues 
we believe that the launch of our high performance color mfp controller into the distribution channels and the development agreement with kyocera mita was a validation of our strategy of moving into high performance color technologies 
see  however  if we are unable to achieve our expected level of sales of peerless sierra technologies on a timely basis  our future revenue and operating results may be harmed and if the marketplace does not accept peerless sierra technologies  our future revenues and operating results may be harmed in the section entitled certain factors and trends affecting us and our business of this annual report on form k 
we believe that our new peerless sierra technologies will contribute an increasing percentage of our overall revenue in the future 
we have addressed the changing demands in the marketplace by investing in cutting edge technologies 
we have also addressed the changing dynamics of the market place by expanding our offerings in new geographic regions and restructuring our sales organization by expanding our sales force in japan 
in addition  as a result of the complexities of the imaging industry  we continue to explore opportunities to enhance our value  including aggressive marketing of our new technologies  developing new market opportunities  raising additional capital and evaluating potential merger and acquisition candidates 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we account for our software revenues in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition as amended by sop  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
table of contents and emerging issues task force  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
over the past two years  we entered into block license agreements that represent unit licenses for products that will be licensed over a period of time 
in accordance with sop  revenue is recognized when the following attributes have been met an agreement exists between us and the oem selling product utilizing our intellectual property and or a third party s intellectual property for which we are an authorized licensor  delivery and acceptance of the intellectual property has occurred  the fees associated with the sale are fixed and determinable and collection of the fees are probable 
under our accounting policies  fees are fixed and determinable if of the fees are to be collected within a twelve month period  in accordance with sop if more than of the payments of fees extend beyond a twelve month period  they are recognized as revenues when they are due for payment  in accordance with sop as of january   we had million in revenues to be recognized in future periods 
for fees on multiple element arrangements  values are allocated among the elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  vsoe 
we generally establish vsoe based upon the price charged when the same elements are sold separately 
when vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  but not for the delivered elements  revenue is recognized using the residual method as prescribed by statement of position if vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements  all revenue for the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe does exist for the undelivered elements or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
we recognize revenues for certain of our engineering services projects on a percentage of completion basis  in accordance with accounting research bulletin  long term construction type contracts and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the estimates to complete the projects are determined by the individual project engineering manager responsible for the oversight of the individual projects 
the estimates are made at the end of each accounting period and are subject to unforeseen circumstances that can increase or decrease the hours necessary to complete the efforts 
for fiscal year  we reported no engineering services revenues on a percentage of completion basis 
we derived revenues from the sale of controllers for mfp devices 
we recognized this revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we sold the controllers to certain oem dealers for distribution to end users 
because it was a relatively new product  we were unable to establish a history regarding returns of product shipped 
therefore  we recognized revenue only upon sales through to end users based on meeting the revenue recognition criteria under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the sale of these controllers was discontinued during the quarter ended january  we provide an accrual for estimated product licensing costs owed to third party vendors whose technology is included in the products sold by us 
the accrual is impacted by estimates of the mix of products shipped under certain of our block license agreements 
the estimates are based on historical data and available information as provided by our customers concerning projected shipments 
should actual shipments under these agreements vary from these estimates  adjustments to the estimated accruals for product licensing costs may be required 
such adjustments have historically been within management s expectations 
as of january   we had net operating loss carry forwards available to reduce future federal and state income of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in fiscal years for federal and for state  respectively 
in addition  as of january   we had tax credit carry forwards available to reduce future income tax liabilities of approximately million  which begin to expire in fiscal year the realization of these assets is based upon management s estimates of future taxable income 
we have provided a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 

table of contents with a change in management s assessment of the uncertainty  the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of any customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based primarily on specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of any of our customers  or the economy as a whole  were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates 
our recurring product licensing revenues are dependent  in part  on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from our oem customers 
these reports are provided only on a calendar quarter basis and  in any event  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  we are required to estimate all of the recurring product licensing revenues for the last month of each fiscal quarter and to further estimate all of our quarterly revenues from an oem when the report from such oem is not received in a timely manner 
in the event we are unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to reporting financial results  we may be required to adjust revenues in subsequent periods 
fiscal year revenues subject to such estimates were minimal 
actual results have historically been consistent with management s estimates

net income net income for the twelve month period ended january  was million or per basic and per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year  and a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal year revenues consolidated revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increases in fiscal year were primarily the result of million in engineering services revenues from the kyocera mita agreement and increases in product 
table of contents licensing 
the decrease in revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily attributable to decreased licensing and engineering services revenues  which were partially offset by higher asics revenues 
product licensing revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year block licensing agreements totaling million were signed during fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during the year 
the remaining million will be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal year this is compared with block licensing agreements of million signed in fiscal year  of which million was recognized as revenue during fiscal year the increase in product licensing revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of increase demand for third party technologies offered by us 
the decreases in product licensing revenue in fiscal years and are mainly attributable to the decrease in demand for the oems products containing our core monochrome technology 
engineering services and maintenance revenues generated by us were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase over the previous two years was the result of the kyocera mita agreement that generated approximately million in revenues during fiscal year revenue generated by hardware sales was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year contract and maintenance backlog at january  was approximately million  as compared with million at january   which does not include the amounts expected under the kyocera mita agreement nor the revenues expected under the pmc sierra agreement that was signed subsequent to january  cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year product licensing costs were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of increased licensing of third party technologies in the current fiscal year  decreases in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due to decreased product licensing revenues and lower levels of third party technologies in those revenues 
in fiscal year  we recorded an additional accrual for the settlement of certain third party licensing costs totaling million 
engineering services and maintenance cost of sales increased to million in fiscal year compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase was the result of the engineering staffing applied to the approximately million in services revenue generated by the kyocera mita agreement 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was the result of the much higher level of engineering services and maintenance revenues which generate lower margins than licensing 
the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due primarily to a proportionately higher level of our intellectual property in our licensing revenues  resulting in a lower cost of sales 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year research and development expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  with the completion of the major development efforts of peerless sierra technologies a substantial portion of engineering staffing was applied to the kyocera mita services effort 
expenses associated with the development of peerless sierra technologies during fiscal years and were comparable 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year 
table of contents was the result of a reduction in staffing levels 
we continued to focus on the launch of peerless sierra technologies and on developing new oem customers  attending industry trade shows  and evaluating other opportunities to promote our core and new color imaging and network solutions 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was due primarily to increased professional services costs primarily associated with compliance with sarbanes oxley 
during fiscal year  we received a million insurance refund for costs associated with completed legal proceedings 
interest income  other income and expenses  and taxes interest income earned in all fiscal years was attributable to interest and investment income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investment balances 
the decrease in fiscal year was a result of a lower level of investments and the cost of our credit facility during fiscal year included in other income in fiscal year was million from the sale of our remaining interest in netreon  inc  announced on february  in addition  we recorded a gain of million associated with the termination of a sublease of a portion of our leased office space at our headquarters in el segundo  california 
additionally  we recorded a  loss for a correction to fiscal year reported accrued interest 
the provisions for income taxes for all fiscal years were primarily the result of foreign income taxes paid 
these income taxes were paid through withholdings on payments of licensing revenues made by our customers to us 
in july  a new tax treaty between the united states and japan ended the requirement for such income taxes 
the effect was to nearly eliminate our foreign income tax provision in all periods subsequent to the effective date of the new treaty 
in fiscal year  the foreign income taxes paid were offset by the release of certain long term tax liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty with respect to our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at january  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations outstanding purchase orders total liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents which  as of january  were million in the aggregate  compared to million at january  the increase was primarily the result of cash provided by operations million and funds provided by stock options being exercised and shares being sold under our employee stock purchase plan espp million 
compared to january   total assets at january  increased to million and stockholders equity increased to million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was compared to last year 
we generated million in cash during the twelve month period ended 
table of contents january  from operations as compared to million in cash used by operations during the twelve month period ended january  our investing activities during the fiscal year ended january  provided cash of million 
this is the result of the sales of investments to provide funds for our operations 
it is our policy to invest the majority of our unused cash in low risk government and commercial debt securities 
we have not historically purchased derivative instruments or entered into hedging transactions 
for the twelve month period ended january   we invested approximately million in property  equipment and leasehold improvements compared to million during the previous twelve month period 
during fiscal year  million was provided by the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal year and million in fiscal year at january   net trade receivables were million lower than at january   due primarily to the timing of the signings and collections of new licensing agreements at the end of the fiscal years 
in fiscal year  we signed and collected significant agreements at the end of the year  in fiscal year  we were unable to collect agreements signed at the end of the year 
as previously mentioned  subsequent to january   we signed an mou with kyocera mita corporation 
the mou provides  among other things  for quarterly payments of million for the next three years for the development of future products 
during fiscal year  we established a credit facility with our bank that allowed for borrowing against outstanding receivables 
the credit facility generally only provided coverage for short term working capital needs 
we decided not to renew our credit facility when it expired in october and we may require additional long term capital to finance working capital requirements 
we expect cash and investments will increase during fiscal year we expect the mou with kyocera mita to provide much of the increase  and  although we expect the cash position to further increase with the expected sales growth associated with peerless sierra technologies  there can be no assurances that we will experience the anticipated increase in peerless sierra technologies sales subsequent to january  we expect to reduce operating expenses as a result of completion of the majority of peerless sierra technologies development effort 
however  if the level of peerless sierra technologies sales is lower than anticipated  we may need to take significant measures to preserve and maintain continued business operations 
in such event  we may need to further reduce costs and may have to access the capital markets to raise additional funding 
there is no assurance that we would be successful in raising capital at attractive terms or at all  and should we be successful in raising capital  the financing may be dilutive to current shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we do not hold any positions in equity securities of other publicly traded companies 
our exposure to interest rate risk in the past relates primarily to our non equity investment portfolio 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we  from time to time  maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  fixed rate debt instruments of the federal  state and local governments and high quality corporate issuers and short term investments in money market funds 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  as of january   we did not hold any corporate debt securities 
although we are subject to interest rate risks in any future investments in these types of securities  we believe an effective increase or decrease of in interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
consequently  our interest rate risk is minimal 

table of contents we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
currently all of our contracts  including those involving foreign entities  are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date  and has no intention of doing so
