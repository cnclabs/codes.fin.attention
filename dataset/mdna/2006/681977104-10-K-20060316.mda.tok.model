net sales for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal sales of the us retail operations for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
approximately one third of the increase in us retail net sales is due to a decrease in the number and percentage of orders the company canceled as a result of prescription verification procedures see regulatory considerations 
the company believes the cancellation rate has now stabilized and does not anticipate any significant change during fiscal the company is continually taking steps to minimize canceled orders  including continued development of a doctor referral network to provide the company s customers more options when their order is deleted due to an expired prescription  as well as the continued development of internal procedures to help obtain the necessary prescription information that is required to fulfill an order 
the balance of the increase in us retail net sales for fiscal can be attributed largely to the following an increase in average order size due principally to an increased number of customer rebate programs instituted during fiscal and throughout all of fiscal  an increase in accessory sales  and a change in product mix 
us retail net sales for fiscal were negatively impacted by the company s decision during the fourth quarter of fiscal to suspend sales of a specific brand of lens  as the company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of this lens from anyone other than the manufacturer  who refuses to sell the company this lens

the company s experience has been that increases in advertising expenditures have a direct impact on the growth of net sales not only in the current period but also in future periods 
the company expenses all advertising costs when the advertising first takes place 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons are impacted within and between quarters by the timing of television  radio and internet advertisements and by the mailing of the company s printed advertisements
