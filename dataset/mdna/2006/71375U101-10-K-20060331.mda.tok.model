item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this annual report 
this annual report may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview we are a rapidly growing information technology consulting firm serving global and midsize companies throughout the united states 
we help clients gain competitive advantage by using internet based technologies to make their businesses more responsive to market opportunities and threats  strengthen relationships with customers  suppliers and partners  improve productivity and reduce information technology costs 
our solutions enable these benefits by integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure and software applications end to end within an organization and with key partners  suppliers and customers 
this provides real time access to critical business applications and information and a scalable  reliable  secure and cost effective technology infrastructure 
services revenue our services revenue is derived from professional services performed developing  implementing  integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure and software applications 
most of our projects are performed on a time and materials basis  and a smaller amount of revenue is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our services revenue for the year ended december  for time and material projects  revenue is recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours our professionals expend in the performance of the project by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenue is generally recognized using the proportionate performance method 
provisions for estimated profits or losses on uncompleted projects are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such profits or losses are determined 
billings in excess of costs plus earnings are classified as deferred revenues 
on many projects  we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenue 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel  and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
software revenue a smaller portion of our revenue is derived from sales of third party software  particularly ibm websphere products 
revenue from sales of third party software is recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction 
in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the software sale transaction and act as an agent  the revenue is recorded on a net basis 
software revenue is expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on our customers demand for our partners software products 
generally  spending on software sales is a strong indicator of future spending on software services 
we also recognize a small portion software revenue from the sale of internally developed software 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits associated with our technology professionals and subcontractors 
cost of revenue also includes third party software costs  reimbursable expenses and other unreimbursed project related expenses 
project related expenses will fluctuate generally depending on outside factors including the cost and frequency of travel and the location of our customers 
cost of revenue does not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenues 
gross margins our gross margins for services are affected by the utilization rates of our professionals  defined as the percentage of our professionals time billed to customers divided by the total available hours in the respective period  the salaries we pay our consulting professionals and the average billing rate we receive from our customers 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled or we retain professionals in advance of receiving project assignments  or if demand for our services declines  our utilization rate will decline and adversely affect our gross margins 
over the past three years  as the information technology software and services industry has recovered from the protracted downturn experienced in and  we have seen an improvement in our utilization rates while our billing  retention and base salary rates have remained relatively stable 
subject to fluctuations resulting from our acquisitions  we expect these key metrics of our services business to remain relatively constant for the foreseeable future assuming there are no further declines in the demand for information technology software and services 
gross margin percentages of third party software sales are typically much lower than gross margin percentages for services and the mix of services and software for a particular period can significantly impact total combined gross margin percentage for such period 
in addition  gross margin for software sales can fluctuate due to pricing and other competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of cash and non cash compensation for sales  executive and administrative employees  costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  professional fees for external auditing services  training  sales and marketing activities  investor relations  recruiting  travel costs and expenses  and miscellaneous expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expenses arising from various option grants to employees with exercise prices below fair market value at the date of grant and compensation expense associated with unvested stock options assumed in business combinations 
such stock compensation is generally expensed across the vesting periods of the related equity grants 
we work to minimize selling costs by focusing on repeat business with existing customers and by accessing sales leads generated by our software company partners  most notably ibm  whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients 
these partnerships enable us to reduce our selling costs and sales cycle times and increase win rates through leveraging our partners marketing efforts and endorsements 
quarterly fluctuations our quarterly operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our fourth and first quarters include the months of december and january  when billable services activity by professional staff as a result of vacation and holidays  as well as engagement decisions by clients  may be reduced due to client budget planning cycles 
demand for our services generally has been lower in the fourth quarter due to reduced activity during the holiday season 
our results will also fluctuate  in part  based on whether we succeed in counterbalancing periodic declines in services revenues when a project or engagement is completed or cancelled by entering into arrangements to provide additional services to the same clients or others 
software sales tend to show some seasonality as well  in that we tend to see higher software demand during the third and fourth quarter of the calendar year due to client budget planning and usage cycles  though this is not always the case 
these and other seasonal factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
plans for growth acquisitions our goal is to build a leading independent information technology consulting firm in the united states through  among other things  expanding our relationships with existing and new clients  leveraging our operations in the central united states to expand nationally and continuing to make disciplined acquisitions 
we believe the united states represents an attractive market for growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
as demand for our services grows  we believe we will attempt to increase the number of professionals in our central united states and canada offices and to add new offices throughout the united states  both organically and through acquisitions  to meet such demand and  as a result  increase our services revenue 
in addition  we believe our track record for identifying attractive acquisitions and our ability to integrate acquired businesses helps us successfully complete acquisitions efficiently and productively  while continuing to offer quality services to our clients  including new clients resulting from the acquisitions 
consistent with our strategy of growth through disciplined acquisitions  we have consummated five acquisitions since january  genisys consulting  inc on april   meritage technologies  inc

total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  services revenue increased to million in from million in these increases were attributable to increased demand for the company s services and to the acquisitions of ipath and vivare in and the full year impact of the acquisitions of genisys  meritage and zettaworks in the following table summarizes the announced approximate annual revenue run rates of these acquired businesses at the date of each acquisition 
these annual revenue run rates are defined as the acquired company s most recent monthly or quarterly realized revenue projected to a full one year total 
acquisition date approximate annual revenue run rate at acquisition date genisys million meritage million zettaworks million ipath million vivare million additionally  the increase in services revenue resulted from increases in average project size and quantity of projects 
the average utilization rate of our professionals  excluding subcontractors  remained relatively stable at for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from sales to ibm 
while the dollar amount of revenue from ibm has remained relatively constant over the past two years  the percentage of total revenue from ibm has decreased as a result of the company s growth and corresponding customer diversification 
software revenue decreased to million in from million in due to the fact that the spike in low gross margin sales during the fourth quarter of did not repeat in the fourth quarter of this software revenue was all from the sale of third party software except for approximately  from the sale of internally developed software recognized in reimbursable expenses increased to million in from million in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue is attributable to an increase in the number of professionals due to hiring and the acquisitions of zettaworks  ipath  and vivare 
the average number of professionals performing services  including subcontractors  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  in addition  the company changed its internal policy for the carry over of billable employee s accrued vacation hours which we had allowed as of december   but discontinued this policy and allowed no more vacation hour carry overs as of december  as a result  the company had approximately  of billable employee s accrued vacation expense as of december  which was forfeited during costs associated with software sales decreased to million in from million in in connection with the decreased software revenue in compared to gross margin 
gross margin increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of services and software revenue  excluding reimbursed expenses  increased slightly to in from in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of services and software revenue is due to a mix of improved software margins off set by lower services margins 
services gross margin decreased slightly to in from in primarily due to lower gross margins on consulting services contracts acquired in the acquisitions of zettaworks and ipath 
these businesses are national practices rather than local practices and  as a result  they incur a greater amount of unreimbursed travel expenses for delivery of services outside of their local geographic market 
unreimbursed expenses negatively impact our services gross margins 
services gross margins have also been impacted by the acquisition of vivare which has slightly lower services gross margins than our historical average 
software gross margin increased to in from in primarily as a result of fluctuations in selling prices to customers based on fluctuations in vendor pricing based on market conditions at the time of the sales and from the sale of internally developed software representing software revenue of approximately  for which there was no associated cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due primarily to increases in the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  professional service fees associated with external audits  and additions of sales personnel  management personnel  support personnel and facilities related to the acquisitions of ipath and vivare in and the full year impact of the acquisitions of genisys  meritage and zettaworks in however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of services revenue  excluding reimbursed expenses  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of services revenue is the result of operational efficiencies and economies of scale as the company has grown 
however  these cost efficiencies have been off set by the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and regular external audit costs which resulted in total costs to the company during of approximately  compared to approximately  in in addition  the company changed its internal policy for the carry over of selling  general and administrative employee s accrued vacation hours which we had allowed as of december   but discontinued this policy and allowed no more vacation hour carry overs as of december  as a result  the company had approximately  of selling  general and administrative employee s accrued vacation expense as of december  which was forfeited during also  during  the company reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately  as a result of improved collections on accounts receivable 
finally  during  the company realized approximately  in reduced organizational meeting expenses as compared to depreciation 
depreciation expense increased to approximately  during from approximately  during the increase is due to a general increase in purchases of fixed assets to accommodate growth 
intangibles amortization 
intangibles amortization expenses  arising from acquisitions  increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense reflects the acquisition of intangibles acquired from zettaworks  ipath  and vivare and full year amortization of intangible assets acquired for genisys and meritage 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  this increase in interest expense is due to the interest expense now being incurred on the newly funded acquisition line of credit which was drawn down in connection with the acquisitions of meritage in june and zettaworks in december  and on draws on the accounts receivable line of credit in connection with the acquisitions of ipath and vivare 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding on the acquisition line of credit and approximately million outstanding on the accounts receivable line of credit 
during  we drew down million on the accounts receivable line of credit and repaid million 
provision for income taxes 
we accrue a provision for federal  state and foreign income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in certain non deductible expenses 
we had deferred tax assets resulting from net operating and capital losses of acquired companies amounting to approximately million for which we had a valuation allowance of approximately million 
we had additional deferred tax assets of approximately million from temporary differences between book and tax valuations 
these combined deferred tax assets of million were off set by deferred tax liabilities of million related to identifiable intangibles  goodwill  and cash to accrual adjustments from the genisys acquisition 
any reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets will be adjusted against goodwill and will not have an impact on our statement of operations 
all of the net operating and capital losses relate to acquired entities  and as such are subject to annual limitations on usage under the change in control provisions of the internal revenue code 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  services revenue  excluding reimbursed expenses  increased to million in from million in this increase was largely attributable to the acquisitions of genisys  meritage and zettaworks which combined accounted for approximately million of services revenue for the year ended december  additionally  the increase in services revenue resulted from increases in average project size and quantity of projects

gross margin increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of revenue  excluding reimbursed expenses  decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of services and software revenue  excluding reimbursed expenses  is primarily due to the increase in software sales revenue in proportion to total revenue  which typically yields a lower margin than our services revenue 
services gross margin  excluding reimbursed expenses  decreased slightly to in from in primarily due to lower gross margins on consulting services contracts acquired in the acquisitions of genisys  meritage and zettaworks 
software gross margin decreased to in from in primarily as a result of fluctuations in selling prices to customers based on competitive pressures and fluctuations in vendor pricing based on market conditions at the time of the sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due primarily to the increases in sales personnel  management personnel  support personnel and facilities related to the acquisitions of genisys  meritage and zettaworks 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of services revenue  excluding reimbursed expenses  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of services revenue is the result of operational efficiencies and economies of scale as the company has grown 
depreciation 
depreciation expense decreased to approximately  during from approximately  during the decrease is due to a general decrease in purchases of fixed assets along with an increasing number of fully depreciated assets 
intangibles amortization 
intangibles amortization expenses  arising from acquisitions  increased to approximately  for the year ended december  from approximately  for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense reflects the acquisition of intangibles acquired from genisys and meritage  partially off set by the end of the assigned three year useful life relating to intangibles acquired in the acquisitions of compete  inc in may and core objective  inc 
in november interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  this decrease in interest expense is due to decreases in the principal balances on the notes payable issued in our acquisition of javelin solutions  inc in and our accounts receivable line of credit since these decreasing balances are partially off set by the interest expense now being incurred on the newly funded acquisition line of credit which was drawn down in connection with the acquisitions of meritage in june and zettaworks in december provision for income taxes 
we accrued a provision for federal  state and foreign income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in certain non deductible expenses 
we had deferred tax assets resulting from net operating losses of acquired companies amounting to approximately million for which we had a valuation allowance of million 
we had additional deferred tax assets of approximately million from temporary differences between book and tax valuations 
these combined deferred tax assets of million were completely off set by deferred tax liabilities of million related to identifiable intangibles and cash to accrual adjustments from the genisys acquisition 
any reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets will be adjusted against goodwill and will not have an impact on our statement of operations 
all of the net operating losses relate to acquired entities  and as such are subject to annual limitations on usage under the change in control provisions of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources selected measures of liquidity and capital resources are as follows in millions as of december cash and cash equivalents working capital net cash provided by operating activities we expect to fund our operations during from cash generated from operations and short term borrowings as necessary from our credit facility 
we believe that these capital resources will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
net cash generated by operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this net cash generated by operations for the years ended december  and included tax benefits from stock option exercises in the amounts of approximately million and approximately  respectively  which will be reported as cash provided by financing activities in future periods as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment on january  net cash generated by operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  totaled million at december   representing approximately days of sales outstanding  excluding end of quarter software sales  compared to million  or days at december  a significant amount of our revenue is derived from ibm 
accordingly  our accounts receivable generally includes significant amounts due from ibm 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable was due from ibm 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   we used approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  to acquire ipath and vivare 
in addition  during we used approximately  to purchase equipment fixed assets and used approximately  for software capitalized for internal use to expand our information management systems 
for the year ended december   we used approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  to acquire genisys  meritage and zettaworks and used approximately  to purchase equipment fixed assets 
net cash from financing activities our financing activities consisted primarily of draws and repayments on credit facilities during we had to raise additional funding during to finance the acquisitions consummated during the year 
during  we used approximately  of offering costs in connection with a shelf registration statement to allow for offers and sales of common stock from time to time as market conditions permit 
during  there was approximately million and  of cash provided by the exercise of stock options and warrants  respectively 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the current available funds  amounts available on our bank credit facilities  net proceeds from the shelf registration  and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements to finance acquisitions for the next twelve months 
availability of funds from bank line of credit facilities we have a million credit facility with silicon valley bank and key bank comprising a million accounts receivable line of credit and a million acquisition line of credit 
borrowings under the accounts receivable line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus  or  as of december  as of december   there was million outstanding under the accounts receivable line of credit and approximately million of available borrowing capacity  excluding approximately  reserved for two outstanding letters of credit to secure facility leases 
this accounts receivable line of credit matures in june our million term acquisition line of credit with silicon valley bank and key bank provides an additional source of financing for certain qualified acquisitions 
as of december  the balance outstanding under this acquisition line of credit was approximately million 
borrowings under this acquisition line of credit bear interest equal to the average four year us treasury note yield plus the initial million draw  of which million remains outstanding  bears interest of at december  and the subsequent million draw  of which million remains outstanding  bears interest of at december  each are repayable in thirty six equal monthly installments  after the first three months which require payment of accrued interest only  beginning october  and april   respectively 
we currently have million of available borrowing capacity under this acquisition line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance during the next twelve months 
substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure the credit facility 
we believe that the current available funds  access to capital from this new debt facility  possible capital from registered placements of equity through the shelf registration  and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and meet our capital needs to finance acquisitions for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we were required to establish various letters of credit totaling  with silicon valley bank to serve as collateral to secure facility leases 
the letters of credit with silicon valley bank reduce the borrowings available under our accounts receivable line of credit 
one letter of credit of  will remain in effect through october  and the other letter of credit of  will remain in effect through june in connection with the acquisition of javelin  we issued million in notes  million of which was payable in four equal annual installments on the anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition in april the other  was payable in eight equal quarterly installments that commenced in july we paid  in   in   in  and  in accordingly  the final annual installment of  remains to be paid in april we have incurred commitments to make future payments under contracts such as leases and certain long term liabilities 
maturities  including estimated interest  under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations  including estimated interest operating lease obligations total subsequent to december   we amended an existing operating lease for one of our facilities increasing the future minimum commitments under the lease by approximately  and extending the lease term from an expiration date of april to april also with this lease amendment  the monthly rental payments were reduced and the requirement for a  letter of credit has been removed 
additionally  subsequent to december   we entered into a new operating lease for one of our facilities creating additional future minimum commitments under a lease agreement of approximately  with a lease term through september additionally  subsequent to december   we amended an existing operating lease for one of our facilities increasing the future minimum commitments under the lease by approximately  and extending the lease term from an expiration date of may to may with these events subsequent to december   maturities under these operating lease contracts are set forth in the following table in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations if our capital is insufficient to fund our activities in either the short or long term  we may need to raise additional funds 
in the ordinary course of business  we may engage in discussions with various persons in connection with additional financing 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders percentage ownership will be diluted 
these equity securities may also have rights superior to our common stock 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to expand our services  respond to competition  pursue acquisition opportunities or continue our operations 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts consulting revenues are comprised of revenue from professional services fees recognized primarily on a time and materials basis as performed 
for fixed fee engagements  revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
billings in excess of costs plus earnings are classified as deferred revenues 
our normal payment terms are net days  although there are some exceptions 
reimbursements for out of pocket expenses are included in gross revenue 
revenue from the sale of third party software is recorded on a gross basis provided that we act as the principal in the transaction 
in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered the principal in the software sale transaction  we record the revenue on a net basis 
there is no effect on net income between recording the software sales on a gross basis versus a net basis 
we also recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as revised by sab revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  acceptance has occurred  and collectibility is deemed probable 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
revenue from internally developed software which is allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as such services are available from other vendors 
we assess our allowance for doubtful accounts at each financial reporting date based on expected losses on uncollectible accounts receivable with known facts and circumstances for the respective period 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement on january  in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill with a periodic review and analysis of such intangibles for possible impairment 
in accordance with statement  we assess our goodwill on october of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets on an annual basis or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of the businesses  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by decreasing net income 
we evaluate long lived tangible assets and intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which we adopted as of january  long lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be entirely recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination was made 
management has determined that no impairment exists as of december  accounting for stock based compensation we apply accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  compensation cost is recognized only when options are granted below market price on the date of grant 
had compensation cost for our stock compensation plans been determined based on fair value at the grant dates for awards under these plans consistent with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  our net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to pro forma amounts indicated in the notes to our financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition of the fair value of employee stock incentive awards 
we have evaluated the requirements under sfas no 
r and we expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 
see further explanation concerning this new standard in recent accounting pronouncements below 
income taxes management believes that our net deferred tax asset should continue to be reduced by a partial valuation allowance 
future operating results and projections could alter this conclusion  potentially resulting in an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance 
since the valuation allowance relates solely to net operating and capital losses from acquired companies which are subject to usage limitations  any decrease in the valuation allowance will be applied first to reduce goodwill and then to reduce other acquisition related non current intangible assets to zero 
any remaining decrease in the valuation allowance would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in our income statement based on their fair values 
this non cash stock compensation is related to past grants which are not fully vested as of december  and all future grants 
following january   pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than january  the adoption of this statement r will have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share in future periods 
statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures based upon either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will use the modified prospective method beginning with our interim report on form q for the period ending march  as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  our current best estimate for stock based compensation expense is approximately million before tax benefits 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires restatement of prior period financial statements  unless impracticable  for changes in accounting principle 
the retroactive application of a change in accounting principle should be limited to the direct effect of the change 
changes in depreciation  amortization or depletion methods should be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
corrections of accounting errors will be accounted for under the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
the effective date of this new pronouncement is for fiscal years beginning after december  and prospective application is required 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
exchange rate sensitivity during  approximately million of our total revenue was attributable to our canadian operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our canadian subsidiary and from client receivables in the canadian dollar 
our canadian subsidiary incurs a significant portion of its expenses in canadian dollars as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
based on the amount of revenue attributed to canada during  this exchange rate risk will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity we have a million credit facility with silicon valley bank and key bank comprising a million accounts receivable line of credit and a million acquisition term line of credit 
borrowings under the accounts receivable line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus  or  as of december  as of december   there was million outstanding under the accounts receivable line of credit and approximately million of available borrowing capacity  excluding approximately  reserved for two outstanding letters of credit to secure facility leases 
our interest expense will fluctuate as the interest rate for this accounts receivable line of credit floats based on the bank s prime rate 
based on the million outstanding under the accounts receivable line of credit as of december   this interest rate risk will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
