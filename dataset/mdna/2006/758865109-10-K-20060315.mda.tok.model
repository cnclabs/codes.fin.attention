executive overview we formed regent in november to acquire  own and operate clusters of radio stations in mid sized and small markets 
our primary objective is to increase regent s value to our stockholders by growing the 
table of contents number of radio stations and markets in which we operate and by improving the financial performance of the stations we own and operate in those markets 
we measure our progress by evaluating our ability to continue to increase the number of stations we own  seeking to improve the post acquisition performance of those acquired radio stations  and by achieving leadership positions in our portfolio of broadcast properties in terms of audience share ratings and revenue generation 
on september   terry s 
jacobs  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  retired from the company 
the company recorded approximately million in cash and non cash expense during the third quarter related to mr 
jacobs board authorized retirement package 
william l 
stakelin  regent s president and chief operating officer  succeeded mr 
jacobs as chief executive officer 
the role of chairman was filled by mr 
william p 
sutter  jr  who has been a member of the company s board of directors since additionally  regent s senior vice president and chief financial officer  anthony a 
vasconcellos  was promoted to executive vice president and chief financial officer 
also on september   and pursuant to the terms of his retirement package  the company repurchased  shares of regent common stock from mr 
jacobs at a price of per share 
the purchase price was based upon the average of the high and low price for a share of regent common stock on september  on july   our credit facility was amended in order for the company to take advantage of then favorable interest rate pricing 
in addition to reducing our borrowing margins  the amendment allows us to borrow up to million for repurchases of our own stock  subject to certain conditions  and resets our maximum leverage ratio to the level that was in place in june at the inception of the credit facility  thus increasing our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we have approximately million remaining under the current stock buyback program authorized by our board on july  during the quarter ended december   we repurchased  shares of regent common stock at a cost of approximately million including commissions  or an average price of per share 
for the full year of we repurchased  shares of our stock at a cost of approximately million  or an average cost of per share 
while our primary strategy remains focused on the acquisition of radio properties  the availability of suitable stations has been severely limited during due to the depressed trading multiples of publicly traded radio broadcasting companies relative to private market values 
in the absence of such availability  we have demonstrated that we will also employ capital to repurchase our own stock when the market price is at a level that we believe to be beneficial to our stockholders to do so 
in december  we paid a one time license fee of  to ibiquity digital corporation for the right to convert of our stations to digital or high definition radio 
the contract we have entered into with ibiquity stipulates that we convert a predetermined number of our stations to high definition radio over a six year period beginning in five of our fm stations were converted to high definition radio in  and a sixth fm station was converted in the beginning of  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
six more fm stations are scheduled for conversion through the remainder of the cost of equipment to convert our stations to high definition is currently averaging approximately  per station 
the conversion will enable the stations to broadcast digital quality sound and also provide certain services  such as on demand traffic  weather and sports scores 
additionally  this new technology will enable each converted radio station to broadcast multiple additional channels of programming for public  private or subscription services 
to date there has been no economic impact on our stations that have converted to high definition radio 
any future economic benefit to our stations as a result of digital conversion is not known at this time 
our comparison of net broadcast revenue from to was impacted by higher levels of political revenue during the fourth quarter of due to the presidential election  as well as elections and political issues at the state and local levels in several of our markets 
additionally  while many of our markets have outperformed the industry in  and we experienced significant increases in revenue in our lafayette  louisiana market as governmental agencies and private companies used radio as a means of communicating with the population affected by hurricane katrina  we have been negatively impacted by downturns in the local economies of our albany  new york  bloomington  illinois and grand rapids  michigan markets 

table of contents advertising revenue in albany decreased approximately compared to the same period of  primarily due to reduced automotive dealer advertising 
the local economy in our bloomington market has been depressed due in part to the after effects of prolonged summer drought conditions  as well as reduced advertising in the automotive dealer category 
evansville local advertising revenue was flat in  while we have invested in the promotion of a new station format at higher than normal levels 
additionally  our bloomington and evansville markets have been subjected to new competitive challenges to some of our programming formats in these markets 
as a result of our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets  we recorded approximately million of expense related to impairment of our fcc licenses and goodwill 
approximately million was related to the impairment of fcc licenses in bloomington  illinois  grand rapids  michigan  and utica  new york  and approximately million was attributable to goodwill impairment in grand rapids  michigan and bloomington  illinois 
in evaluating the fair market value of our fcc licenses  we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates variables such as revenue  revenue share projections  projected operating profit margins and a discount rate 
the variables used in our analysis reflect industry performance norms  as well as the anticipated performance of the radio stations 
to evaluate the impairment of goodwill  we used a market multiple approach commonly used as a valuation technique in the broadcast industry 
the fcc license and goodwill impairment was due to a combination of factors  including the adjustment of certain metrics used to measure the discounted cash flow utilized in the valuation  and the adjustment of cash flow multiples to reflect current industry conditions 
in our albany  new york market  new programming began on december   to reformat our simulcast rock formatted stations wqbk fm and wqbj fm  which previously had carried the howard stern show 
the howard stern show began broadcasting exclusively on satellite radio in although we don t believe that the company as a whole will be significantly impacted by this change  we anticipate that net broadcast revenue in albany will be negatively impacted in the short term 
this will be mitigated somewhat by the elimination of program rights fees associated with airing the program  which were approximately million in we completed a transaction in our ft 
collins greeley  colorado market during the fourth quarter of in which another broadcaster paid us million to relocate our ktrr fm antenna from its location on a leased tower to our owned kuad fm tower 
this relocation enables us to have a better signal into the ft 
collins greeley market and relieved us of a long term lease commitment for the former site of the antenna 
as a result of this transaction we reported a pre tax gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our accounting estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allocating the purchase price of acquisitions  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  determining the recoverability of our long lived assets  and evaluating our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets our fcc licenses qualify as indefinite lived intangible assets  and represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet 
we utilize the greenfield methodology for valuation of our fcc licenses  which allocates a start up value to each station and employs a discounted cash flow methodology and accepted appraisal techniques and internal revenue service guidelines 
to test goodwill  we utilize a market multiple approach at the reporting unit level 
local economic conditions in each of our markets could impact whether an fcc license or goodwill is impaired  as a decrease or increase in market revenue could negatively or positively impact discounted cash flows 
additionally  other factors such as interest rates  the performance of the s p  cash flow multiples as well as capital expenditures  can affect the discounted cash flow analysis 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  an impairment loss will be recorded in operating income 
allocation of acquisition purchase price we believe the determination of the fair value of our acquired fcc licenses is a critical accounting policy as their value is significant relative to our total assets 
we typically engage independent third parties to appraise the fair value of our acquired tangible and intangible assets  however  in some instances we apply our own direct valuation methods to determine the value of tangible assets  fcc licenses  and other intangible assets 
the fcc license valuation utilized employs a discounted cash flow analysis with critical assumptions about market growth  cash flow growth  multiples of cash flow  and other economic factors 
determining the recoverability of long lived assets our long lived assets to be held and used fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable  we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of our long lived assets based upon the market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if necessary 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
the amount of intangible assets with definite lives that we have recorded is not material 
deferred tax assets at december   we had current and long term deferred tax assets of approximately million before valuation allowance  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
while we have a valuation allowance of approximately million set up for tax assets expiring through  we have determined that it is not necessary to record a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards that expire in years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the anticipated future run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and tax deductible goodwill by however  there is no assurance that our projections will be achieved  and if our taxable income projections fall short  we most likely would need to record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that would not be utilized 
the need to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize a portion  or the remainder of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if it were determined that we would be able to utilize a portion of 
table of contents the net operating loss carryforwards that are currently reduced by a valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate due to unfavorable law changes or unforeseen circumstances  we could experience losses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we routinely review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
a one percent change to our allowance as a percent of our outstanding accounts receivable at december  would cause a decrease in net income of approximately million  net of tax

while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter net broadcast revenue comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of markets disposed of during those years

as of december  we had utilized approximately million of the new million stock repurchase limit 
we believe that we have sufficient access to funds so that we will be able to pursue our acquisition strategy in if we are able to find suitable acquisitions at acceptable prices 
we also anticipate that if we were to make an acquisition that would require borrowings in excess of our current borrowing capacity  we would be able to fund our capital requirements by either refinancing our current credit facility  or by obtaining financing through a variety of options available to us  including  but not limited to  access to public capital through our shelf registration statement

we expect the long term liquidity of the company to be strong  as radio stations typically do not have large capital requirements 
excluding projects to consolidate duplicate market facilities or to expand facilities to adequately house stations acquired from other operators  our capital expenditures have typically been approximately of our net revenue

net cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately in to approximately million  compared to million in the million decrease was due primarily to decreased station operating income at our radio stations
