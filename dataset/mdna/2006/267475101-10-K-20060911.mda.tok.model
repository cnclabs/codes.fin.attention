overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground locating services to various utilities including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others 
additionally  we provide services on a limited basis in canada 
for the year ended july   specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating  and electric and other construction and maintenance to electric utilities and others contributed approximately   and  respectively  to our total revenues 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  and changes in the general level of construction activity 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecommunication providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are covered by multi year master service agreements  and we are currently a party to over of these agreements 
master service agreements generally are for contract periods of one or more years and contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete unit pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability by the customer to issue to others work orders valued above a specified dollar limit  the self performance of the work by the customer s in house workforce if available  and the ability to use others when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services is provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for these projects generally span three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld by the customer subject to project completion in accordance with the contract specifications 

table of contents we recognize revenues using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenue from other percentage of completion contracts is recognized using the cost to cost measures and is based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the following table summarizes our revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  as a percentage of total revenue of revenue fiscal year ended july  july  multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage increase in revenue derived from multi year master service agreements is primarily due to agreements in place at prince telecom holdings  inc prince which was acquired in december hurricane restoration services provided in the second half of calendar were performed pursuant to short term contracts 
as a result  the percentage of revenue from total long term contracts for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers contributing at least of our total revenue in fiscal   or fiscal year ended july  july  july  bellsouth verizon comcast embarq formerly sprint charter qwest directv windstream formerly alltel adelphia adelphia was acquired by time warner and comcast effective july  in august  in accordance with our contractual rights  we notified directv of our intention to cease performing services for them effective february management does not believe that this will have a material impact on our revenues or results of operations 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
for a majority of our contracts  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance services 
the materials supplied by our customers are not included in our revenue or costs of sales as the customer retains the financial and performance risk associated with the materials 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our 
table of contents utility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
general and administrative costs include all of our costs at the corporate level  as well as costs of our subsidiaries management personnel and administrative overhead 
these primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  professional fees  provision or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to the provision of services under our customer contracts 
our senior management  including senior managers of our subsidiaries  performs substantially all sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
acquisitions during december  we acquired the outstanding common stock of prince for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees 
prince installs and maintains customer premise equipment  including set top boxes and cable modems  for leading cable multiple system operators throughout the united states 
during september  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of rje telecom  inc rje for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
rje provides specialty contracting services primarily to telephone companies 
in december  we acquired utiliquest holdings corp 
utiliquest 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of first south utility construction  inc first south and assumed certain liabilities associated with these assets 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to governmental deregulation  advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable industries converge  and growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability which in turn  increases the needs of customers for the services we provide 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to begin to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
fiber deployments are also beginning to facilitate the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
during and  several large telephone companies announced fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives as a means to begin to actively compete with cable operators 
these initiatives continued through fiscal and continue to result in demand for our services 
this demand for fiber deployments has also been accompanied by the telecommunications industry s general recovery from the severe industry downturn during and we believe the latest developments and trends in the telecommunications industry support our outlook for growth 
consistent with historical practice  telecommunications providers have continued to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
we also provide underground utility locating services to a variety of utility companies including telecommunication providers 
underground excavation is involved in a substantial portion of overall economic activity  including the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and 
table of contents existing commercial and residential projects 
utility line locating is required prior to underground excavation 
the recent trend for outsourcing this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity  primarily influences the demand for our utility line locating services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued self insured claims  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  including amortization of intangibles  and accounting for income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
application of these estimates and assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies on our operations is discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenue from other percentage of completion contracts is recognized using cost to cost measures and is based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and material based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
contract costs include the direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including those for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
for the majority of our contracts  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment to perform installation and maintenance services 
the materials supplied by our customers are not included in our revenue or costs of sales as the customer retains the financial and performance risk associated with the materials 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 

table of contents self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our utility locating services 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued self insured claims 
as of july   the liability for self insured claims and related accrued processing costs was million compared to million at july  based on past experience  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  to be paid in the next months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they may not be paid until some time in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of claims  the hazard level of our operations  the payment patterns for incurred claims  changes in the medical condition of claimants  the frequency of use of our health plan by participants  and economic factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the increase in accrued self insured claims liability at july  was primarily related to an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  higher deductible levels at utiliquest  the timing of our claim payments  and the acquisition of prince 
the calculation of the estimated accrued liability for self insured claims is inherently subject to uncertainty 
excluding prince  which was acquired in december  we have retained the risk of loss to million on a per occurrence basis for workers compensation and automobile liability claims for fiscal for general liability claims  we have retained the risk of loss to  except with respect to utiliquest  for which we have retained the risk of loss to million per occurrence 
for prince  fiscal claims related to automobile liability and workers compensation were covered under a guaranteed cost program and  for general liability claims  we have retained the risk of loss to  per occurrence 
for certain prior periods  prince retained the risk of automobile liability  general liability  and workers compensation claims up to  at july   the liability for these claims is included in our accrued self insured claims liability 
for fiscal year  we had aggregate stop loss coverage for the above exposures at a stated retention of million 
for fiscal we maintained umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit of million 
except for prince  we have retained the risk of loss for automobile liability and general liability and damage claims between million and million  on a per occurrence basis  with an aggregate stop loss for this layer of million 
for prince  we have umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit of million for automobile liability and general liability claims that occurred prior to acquisition 
for claims related to periods after we acquired prince  losses above prince s policy limit are covered by our stop loss coverage of million and the umbrella liability coverage up to a policy limit of million 
the retention amounts are applicable in substantially all of the states in which we operate 
for losses occurring in fiscal  we expect to retain the same risk amounts as for fiscal  except that we will have an aggregate stop loss coverage for these exposures at a stated retention of approximately million 
excluding prince  we have retained the risk of loss for claims under our employee health plan occurring in fiscal to  per participant on a annual basis 
for fiscal  we have an aggregate stop loss coverage for this exposure at the stated retention of approximately million 
for losses occurring under our employee health plan in fiscal  we expect to retain the same risk and coverage amounts as for fiscal for fiscal  claims under prince s employee health plan were covered under a guaranteed cost program 
the methods of calculating the estimated accrued liabilities for self insured claims are inherently subject to uncertainty 
if actual results significantly differ from estimates used to calculate the liability  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially impacted 
goodwill and intangible assets as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated 
table of contents amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our reporting units are tested annually in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of the goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable intangible asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows of each reporting unit considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
generally  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
additionally  we use judgment in determining the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the purchase price allocations from our prior acquisitions and due to our decentralized structure  our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  and the other factors described under risk factors herein  the profitability of our individual reporting units may periodically suffer from downturns in customer demand and other factors 
these factors may have a relatively more pronounced impact on the goodwill at individual reporting units as compared to the impact they would have if goodwill were recorded for the company as a whole as one reporting unit 
if material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units  our future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our can am communications  inc can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and due to operational inefficiencies at existing levels of work 
can am began incurring operating losses during fiscal  primarily as a result of poor performance on existing contracts due to high job management costs during the period of reduced work levels 
in addition  can am failed to achieve projected revenue growth due to declines in demand from existing customers and its inability to secure new customer work at pricing levels sufficient to offset operating costs 
we recently changed the senior management at can am  integrating certain of its operations with another of our subsidiaries in order to improve operational efficiency at the current work levels 
however  we are uncertain of the time period that the changes will take to improve the performance of can am and the extent to which the changes may be effective 
while management does not expect can am to generate material losses in future periods  we determined that the anticipated cash flows from new opportunities were subject to a higher degree 
table of contents of uncertainty than previously anticipated and that future cash flows would not likely be sufficient to support the carrying value of can am s goodwill balance 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit over the seven year period used in our sfas no 
impairment analysis and are circumstances that we determined would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of the end of the fiscal third quarter 
as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  consequently  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 
as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our white mountain cable construction wmcc reporting unit was impaired and consequently recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from reduced work levels for a significant customer  a shift in the timing of expected cash flows from another customer to later periods in our forecast which reduced the present value of the future cash flows from this customer and wmcc s operational underperformance during the fourth quarter of the combination of these factors had an adverse impact on the anticipated future cash flows of the wmcc reporting unit used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduced work levels at wmcc were primarily the result of a reduction in demand from a single significant customer 
this was due to the customer s decisions regarding the allocation of their capital spending away from work that management anticipated would be performed by wmcc 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
this change in the allocation of capital spending by the customer away from work provided by wmcc did not have an adverse impact on our other subsidiaries 
the historical cash flows of wmcc had been positive  but trended downward during fiscal as wmcc incurred losses 
this negative trend was the result of unanticipated poor operating performance due to unforeseen job site conditions which impacted productivity  an inability to effectively secure and manage subcontractors at acceptable cost and the under absorption of general and administrative expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal management had expected improvements in operating performance as the level of work increased  however  as a result of the factors specified above wmcc incurred an operating loss during the fourth quarter ended july  as a result of these factors  management determined that wmcc would be unable to meet expected profitability measures at the existing work levels which indicated that the anticipated long term cash flows from the business would be materially less than previously expected over the seven year cash flow period used in the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
although we have made operational changes in an effort to improve the performance and profitability of wmcc and management does not expect wmcc to generate material losses in future periods  we are uncertain of the time period that the changes will take to improve the performance and the extent to which the changes may be effective 
the estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units was based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment test were a expected cash flow periods of seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our can am reporting unit during the interim impairment test in fiscal were a expected cash flow periods of seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting unit 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during fiscal  including wmcc  were a expected cash flow periods of 
table of contents seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
management believes the rates used are consistent with the risks inherent in our current business model and with industry discount rates 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
a variance in the discount rate used could have had a significant impact on the amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded 
for example  a change in the discount rate would have caused an increase or decrease in the wmcc goodwill impairment charges by approximately million 
additionally  a change in the discount rate would have changed the estimated fair value of our reporting units and may have caused other reporting units to incur impairment charges 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value for the annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal for fiscal  two reporting units  one having a goodwill balance of approximately million and the other having a goodwill balance of approximately million  have experienced declining revenue and operating results due to a reduction in demand from the customers they serve 
this decline is primarily the result of reduced spending by cable providers to upgrade their networks in recent periods compared to historical levels 
our fiscal annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units was significantly in excess of their carrying values 
we believe that the goodwill is recoverable as of july   however  there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be impaired in future periods 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and provide incentives for talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
as of july   we had seven stock based compensation plans 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which amended sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires that share based awards granted to employees be fair valued on the date of grant and the related expense recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
sfas no 
r became effective for the company on july   the first day of fiscal prior to fiscal  the company accounted for stock based compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
which required recognition of compensation expense using the intrinsic value method  whereby compensation expense was determined as the excess of the market value of the underlying stock over the exercise price of the option at the date of grant 
consequently  no stock based compensation expense for stock option grants was reflected in net income as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
beginning july   the company has applied the modified prospective application of sfas no 
r to all of its stock based awards 
additionally  during fiscal the company has shifted from granting stock options to its employees and officers to granting time based and performance based restricted stock awards see note  stock based awards in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  compensation cost must be recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine whether it is probable the performance conditions will be satisfied at each reporting period and record compensation costs accordingly  however  the recognition or non recognition of such compensation cost remains subject to uncertainty 
if the performance conditions are not met for performance vesting restricted stock  no compensation costs will be recognized for those shares and any compensation cost recognized previously for those shares will be reversed 
based on the amount of unvested stock options outstanding as of july   the total unrecognized compensation cost is million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested time based restricted shares as of july  is million which is each expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the maximum unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance based awards is million 
this cost will be recognized over a weighted average period of years if all performance conditions are met and the maximum amount of restricted stock under outstanding awards is granted 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  our compensation committee approved the accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options granted under the incentive stock option plan and the long 
table of contents term incentive plan to employees and officers having per share exercise prices equal to or greater than the closing market price on the date of acceleration  july  
approximately million options to purchase shares became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration 
in the case of officers at or above the level of senior vice president  the compensation committee imposed a holding period that will require the optionees to refrain from selling common stock acquired upon the exercise of these options other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and satisfying withholding taxes until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option s original vesting terms 
the primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would have otherwise recognized in our consolidated statements of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption sfas no 
r 
the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the acceleration resulted in the recognition of an additional million pre tax expense included in the fiscal pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the exclusion of such amounts from compensation expense in future years 
as a result of the prior year acceleration and expected future grants  we expect our stock based compensation expense to continue to increase in fiscal and fiscal accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment regarding the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of july  because management believes that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary basis differences reverse over time 
our judgments are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe that we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances on a regular basis 
this review considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that none of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with sfas no 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined

this decrease in telecommunications service revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from a significant customer engaged in a fiber deployment project and due to a decrease in revenue from another significant customer that completed an upgrade project to their network in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by a net increase of million for hurricane restoration services performed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and from revenues from new contracts with existing customers 
total revenues from underground utility line locating for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is primarily the result of additional work performed for existing customers and work performed related to the hurricanes that impacted the southeastern united states during the later part of calendar our total revenues from electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to work pursuant to a specific customer contract that commenced in the later part of fiscal  which we completed during the first half of fiscal  and additional work performed for both existing and new customers 
costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary components of this dollar increase were equipment and other direct costs  direct labor and subcontractor costs taken together  and direct materials  which increased million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to higher levels of operations during fiscal  including the operations of prince since its acquisition in december as a percentage of contract revenues  costs of earned revenues increased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal increases for equipment and other direct costs contributed of the increase  primarily due to increased overall insurance costs as a result of higher premiums and loss development activity for self insured claims  and increased fuel and rental costs for our vehicles and equipment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease as a percentage of contract revenues of in direct labor and subcontracted labor  combined  primarily as a result of less subcontracted labor in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior year  which enabled us to reduce our total labor costs in proportion to our contract revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in total general and 
table of contents administrative expenses for fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in stock based compensation expenses compared to fiscal as a result of sfas no 
r implementation and from general and administrative costs of prince  which was acquired in december these dollar amount increases were partially offset by decreased professional fees primarily as a result of a reduction in sarbanes oxley related costs  as fiscal was the first year of implementation  and improved bad debt experience during fiscal compared to fiscal the total amount of stock based compensation expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in stock based compensation resulted from applying sfas no 
r to our unvested stock options outstanding and restricted stock awards granted to employees and officers in december see note in notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
prior to sfas no 
r our stock based awards primarily consisted of stock options  for which we did not recognize expense as we accounted for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we now recognize compensation expense for stock options over the vesting period 
our restricted stock grants are also accounted for under sfas no 
r and we have recognized compensation expense based on the fair value at the date of grant over the requisite service periods of the awards 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues is primarily a result of the effect of the prince acquisition  which increased contract revenues at a greater rate than its increase to general and administrative costs 
we also incurred lower sarbanes oxley related costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which contributed to the percentage decrease in general and administrative expenses 
offsetting the decline in general and administrative costs as a percentage of contract revenue was million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal due to implementation of sfas no 
r as compared to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and remained consistent as a percentage of contract revenues at in both fiscal and fiscal the dollar amount of the increase for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of the addition of fixed assets and amortizing intangibles relating to the acquisition of prince in december these increases were partially offset by fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during the period 
goodwill impairment charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it has underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and due to operational inefficiencies at existing levels of work 
can am began incurring operating losses during fiscal  primarily as a result of poor performance on existing contracts due to high job management costs during the period of reduced work levels 
in addition  can am failed to achieve projected revenue growth due to declines in demand from existing customers and its inability to secure new customer work at pricing levels sufficient to offset operating costs 
we recently changed the senior management at can am  integrating certain of its operations with another of our subsidiaries  in order to improve operational efficiency at the current work levels 
however  we are uncertain of the time period that the changes will take to improve the performance of can am and the extent to which the changes may be effective 
while management does not expect can am to generate material losses in future periods  we determined that the anticipated cash flows from new opportunities were subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than previously anticipated and that future cash flows would not likely be sufficient to support the carrying value of can am s goodwill balance 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit over the seven year period used in our sfas no 
impairment analysis and are circumstances that we determined would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of april  as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  consequently  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 

table of contents during fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our wmcc reporting unit as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis 
this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from reduced work levels for a significant customer  a shift in the timing of expected cash flows from another customer to later periods in our forecast which reduced the present value of the future cash flows from this customer and wmcc s operational underperformance during the fourth quarter of the combination of these factors had an adverse impact on the anticipated future cash flows of the wmcc reporting unit used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduced work levels at wmcc were primarily the result of a reduction in demand from a single significant customer 
this was due to the customer s decisions regarding the allocation of their capital spending away from work that management anticipated would be performed by wmcc 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
this change in the allocation of capital spending by the customer away from work provided by wmcc did not have an adverse impact on other subsidiaries of ours 
the historical cash flows of wmcc had been positive  but trended downward during fiscal as wmcc incurred losses 
this negative trend was the result of unanticipated poor operating performance due to unforeseen job site conditions which impacted productivity  an inability to effectively secure and manage subcontractors at acceptable cost and the under absorption of general and administrative expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal management had expected improvements in operating performance as the level of work increased  however  as a result of the factors specified above wmcc incurred an operating loss during the fourth quarter ended july  as a result of these factors  management determined that wmcc would be unable to meet expected profitability measures at the existing work levels which indicated that the anticipated long term cash flows from the business would be materially less than previously expected over the seven year cash flow period used in the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
although we have made operational changes in an effort to improve the performance and profitability of wmcc and management does not expect wmcc to generate material losses in future periods  we are uncertain of the time period that the changes will take to improve the performance and the extent to which the changes may be effective 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal as compared to prior year is primarily a result of higher interest rates during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase is due to the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes notes and million of borrowings from our credit facility 
the issuance of the notes and the borrowing from our credit facility were used to purchase million shares of our common stock in october and used in connection with our acquisition of prince in december the million in borrowing from our credit facility has subsequently been repaid 
other income  net 
other income decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of a lesser number of assets sold during fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes 
the following table presents our income tax expense and effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal dollars in millions fiscal year ended july  july  income taxes effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was significantly higher than the applicable statutory rates in the jurisdictions where we operate as a result of the non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
those impairment charges are not

this decrease in telecommunications service revenues was primarily attributable to revenues from two customers that were completing upgrade projects to their networks and a decline in revenue from a construction and maintenance contract with a significant customer 
the decrease was offset in part by revenues from one of our significant customers engaged in a fiber deployment project  and general increases in construction activities for other telecommunications customers 

table of contents excluding the revenue of utiliquest for each fiscal period  revenues from underground utility locating services for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased operational activity and increased professional fees related to our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts 
fiscal includes a charge of approximately million associated with a legal judgment and related expenses that resulted from a contract dispute that arose from the pre acquisition operations of one of our subsidiaries 
the percentage decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the relatively fixed nature of the expenses in relation to the higher revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal bad debt expense 
bad debt expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of revenues to from 
the dollar increase was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization from property and equipment and intangible assets related to the fiscal acquisition of rje and a full year of depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year acquisitions of utiliquest and first south  as well as increased levels of capital expenditures during the second half of fiscal and during fiscal goodwill impairment charge 
during fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our wmcc reporting unit as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis

those receivables had a book value of approximately million  reflecting a write down of million in fiscal relating to the bankruptcy of adelphia

our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage controllable costs effectively

backlog 
our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts  including master service agreements 
in many instances our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under a contract 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical relationships with customers and our experience in procurements of this nature 
for certain multi year projects relating to fiber deployments for one of our significant customers  we have included in the july  backlog amounts relating to anticipated work through the remainder of calendar years and with respect to these projects  in the july  backlog  we included only those amounts for work through the remainder of calendar these fiber deployment projects  when initially installed  are not required for the day to day provision of services by that customer 
consequently  the fiber deployment projects of this customer generally have been subject to more uncertainty  as compared to those of our other customers  with regards to activity levels 
we have taken our current approach to the backlog for these fiber deployment projects as a result of the customer s expressed continued commitment to the program and having agreed to pricing through calendar year our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
our backlog at july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
we expect to complete approximately of our current backlog during the next twelve months 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as most of our work is performed outdoors 
as a result  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which impacts the number of available workdays and paid holiday expense 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuation in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuation in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on social security withholdings  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  and fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and our debt obligations 
the impact on cash and equivalents held as of july  using a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in a change to interest income or expense of approximately million 
we manage this risk by investing in short term investments with market rates of interest 
as of july   outstanding long term debt included our million notes which bear a fixed rate of interest of and are due in due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on our interest expense 
the fair value of the notes as of july  based on quoted market prices totaled approximately million 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect at july  would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
in addition  we have approximately million of notes payable that bear interest at fixed rates and are due during fiscal and approximately million of capital leases with varying rates of interest due during fiscal a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates in effect at july  on these notes payable or capital leases would not result in a material change in the fair value due to the short term maturity of the debt obligations 
as of july  there were no amounts outstanding under our credit agreement  which generally permits borrowings at variable rate of interest 
we manage the interest rate risk on our all of debt primarily through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
