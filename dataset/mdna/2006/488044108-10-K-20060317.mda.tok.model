item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share data financial review the following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the company s results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and operating segment results 
the amounts and disclosures included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  unless otherwise indicated  are presented on a continuing operations basis 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the company s internal reporting utilizes net earnings  earnings per share and gross profit excluding the impairment  restructuring and related non recurring charges and the tax benefit from repatriation discussed below 
such items excluding the impairment  restructuring and related non recurring charges and the income tax benefit from repatriation are referred to as ongoing 
management evaluates each of its divisions using these ongoing measures in order to isolate the results of operations by excluding these charges and benefits  which were infrequent and non recurring 
therefore  throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  there will be a discussion of operating results both including and excluding the impairment  restructuring and related non recurring charges 
the ongoing amounts that exclude the impairment  restructuring and related non recurring charges are non gaap measures and may not be comparable to measures used by other entities 
operating results restructuring plan during the second quarter of  the company announced a restructuring plan the restructuring plan aimed at advancing the company s corporate objectives of increasing its penetration of consumer lifestyle brands with strong growth and profit potential while reducing exposure to smaller volume brands and certain private label businesses 
the restructuring plan resulted from a thorough strategic reassessment of all of the company s business operations 
this reassessment was performed in the second quarter of and was directed by the company s chief executive officer who was named to that position during the second quarter 
the strategic reassessment focused on the company s businesses that had experienced profitability issues and considered the alignment of the businesses with the company s refreshed strategy  which considered  among other things  market place developments affecting the retail landscape and the company s retail customers 
under the restructuring plan  the company o sold the biflex and dotti operations and shut down the remaining operations making up its kellwood intimate apparel group intimate apparel division  o sold the david brooks operation and shut down the remaining operations making up its kellwood new england division  o shut down its private label menswear which does not include the company s smart shirts subsidiary division  o restructured its oakland operation by exiting several labels to better focus on developing the koret brand  and o made organization and support infrastructure changes for certain ongoing divisions and reviewed assumptions regarding future profitability and their effect on the realizability of fixed and intangible assets of certain brands  labels and operations 
the results of operations and impairment  restructuring and related non recurring charges for the businesses sold and shut down are reported as discontinued operations 
the gains and losses on consummated transactions involving the sale of operations are included as part of net loss from discontinued operations and are not significant 
see note to consolidated financial statements for further information on the operating results and financial position of the discontinued businesses 
costs associated with the restructuring plan include impairment of intangible assets  inventory and purchase commitment reserves  contractual obligations  employee severance and termination benefits  fixed asset impairment and sales allowances 
the total cost of these actions is expected to be approximately  before tax  after tax or per diluted share 
of this amount   before tax  after tax or per diluted share was recorded in the remaining amounts will be charged in and later years as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the reduction in the total expected cost of the restructuring plan from the original estimate of  before tax  after tax or per diluted share to the current estimate of  before tax  after tax or per diluted share is due to a number of factors o much better than anticipated sales to existing customers without significant order cancellations or price concessions resulted in realization of inventory at higher than expected amounts  o the sales of the assets of biflex  dotti and david brooks resulted in realization of inventory at higher than expected amounts  o new york office relocations  success in subleasing and assumptions by asset buyers were all better than anticipated  resulting in lower lease obligation costs  o hiring of associates by the buyers of assets and attrition were better than planned  resulting in lower severance costs  and o customer markdown support and chargebacks did not materialize at higher than normal levels to the extent anticipated

general corporate

general corporate expenses for were  decreasing  or versus primarily as a result of the recording of a death benefits accrual in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results will differ from those estimates and assumptions and the differences may be material 
significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results are discussed below 
accounts receivable reserves for allowances accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for bad debts as well as existing and expected future chargebacks from customers 
it is the nature of the apparel and soft goods industry that suppliers like the company face significant pressure from customers in the retail industry to provide allowances to compensate for customer margin shortfalls 
this pressure often takes the form of customers requiring the company to provide price concessions on prior shipments as a prerequisite for obtaining future orders 
pressure for these concessions is largely determined by overall retail sales performance and  more specifically  the performance of the company s products at retail 
to the extent the company s customers have more of the company s goods on hand at the end of the season  there will be greater pressure for the company to grant markdown concessions on prior shipments 
the company s accounts receivable balances are reported net of expected allowances for these matters based on the historical level of concessions required and the company s estimates of the level of markdowns and allowances that will be required in the coming season in order to collect the receivables 
the company evaluates the allowance balances on a continuing basis and adjusts them as necessary to reflect changes in anticipated allowance activity 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from customers that are unable to meet their financial obligations 
estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts by the company involves consideration of the financial condition of specific customers as well as general estimates of future collectibility based on historical experience and expected future trends 
the estimation of these factors involves significant judgment 
in addition  actual collection experience  and thus bad debt expense  can be significantly impacted by the financial difficulties of as few as one customer 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at cost 
inventory values are reduced to net realizable value when there are factors indicating that certain inventories will not be sold on terms sufficient to recover their cost 
the company s products can be classified into two types replenishment and non replenishment 
replenishment items are those basics bras  dress shirts  infant apparel  etc 
that are not highly seasonal or dependent on fashion trends 
the same products are sold by retailers months a year  and styles evolve slowly 
retailers generally replenish their stocks of these items as they are sold 
only a relatively small portion of the company s business involves replenishment items 
the majority of the company s products consist of items that are non replenishment as a result of being highly tied to a season or fashion look 
these products are economically perishable 
the value of this seasonal merchandise might be sufficient for the company to generate a profit over its cost at the beginning of its season  but by the end of its season a few months later the same inventory might be salable only at less than cost 
for these products  the selling season generally ranges from three to six months 
the value may rise again the following year when the season in which the goods sell approaches or it may not  depending on the level of prior year merchandise on the market and on year to year fashion changes 
while some prior year merchandise is sold by the company through its own outlet stores  the majority of out of season inventories must be sold to off price retailers and other customers who serve a customer base that will purchase prior year fashions 
the amount  if any  that these customers will pay for prior year fashions is determined by the desirability of the inventory itself as well as the general level of prior year goods available to these customers 
the assessment of inventory value  as a result  is highly subjective and requires an assessment of the seasonality of the inventory  its future desirability  and future price levels in the off price sector 
many of the company s products are purchased for and sold to specific customers orders 
others are purchased in anticipation of selling them to a specific customer 
the loss of a major customer  whether due to the customer s financial difficulty or other reasons  could have a significant negative impact on the value of the inventory expected to be sold to that customer 
this negative impact can also extend to purchase obligations for goods that have not yet been received 
these obligations involve product to be received into inventory over the next one to six months 
market value assessments of goodwill and intangible assets before the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the values of goodwill and intangible assets were written off over the period expected to be benefited through regular amortization charges 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be written off through periodic charges to the income statement over the defined period 
future impairment charges may be required if the value of the reporting unit becomes less than its book value 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units is highly subjective  as it is determined largely by projections of future profitability and cash flows 
this evaluation utilizes discounted cash flow analysis and analyses of historical and forecasted operating results of the company s reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is compared to the book value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
if a deficiency exists  impairment will be calculated 
impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the goodwill and its carrying amount 
the fair value of goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole and the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities 
the annual impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter  and additional testing would be necessary if a triggering event were to occur in an interim period 
identifiable intangible assets include trademarks  customer base and license agreements  which are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years weighted average life of years 
impairment testing of these would occur if and when a triggering event occurs 
new accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and disallows the use of the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock compensation 
this statement was to be effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after june   however  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a rule that amends the effective date for sfas no 
r for public companies 
the sec s new rule allows public companies to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period that begins after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which will require the recording of stock option expense in the statement of operations beginning on january   the first day of the first quarter of the company expects that stock option expense will approximate  and both amounts after tax in and  respectively 
the company currently accounts for stock based compensation under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no
