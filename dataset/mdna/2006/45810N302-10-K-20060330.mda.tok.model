item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto and other financial and operating information included in this form k 
overview integramed america  inc offers products and services to patients and providers in the fertility industry 
we have developed a network comprised of twenty six contracted fertility centers in major markets across the united states  products and services designed to support fertility center growth  products in the pharmaceutical and patient financing areas  a shared risk refund program and captive insurance offerings 
eighteen affiliate fertility centers purchase discrete service packages provided by us and eight fertility centers have access to our entire portfolio of products and services under our comprehensive fertilitypartners tm program 
all twenty six centers have access to our consumer services  principally pharmaceutical products  our shared risk refund product and patient financing products 
our business strategy is to align our information  technology and financial strengths for the benefit of both providers and consumers of fertility services 
the primary elements of this strategy include i expanding our network of affiliated fertility centers  ii entering into additional fertilitypartners contracts  iii increasing revenues and profits at contracted fertilitypartners centers  iv increasing the number and value of service packages purchased by members of our network  v increasing penetration of our shared risk refund treatment program throughout the network  and vi increasing sales of pharmaceutical products to fertility patients 
major events impacting financial condition and results of operations in december  we amended our existing credit agreement with bank of america 
the amended agreement is comprised of a renewal and increase in our three year revolving credit line to million  and a new million five year term loan  of which approximately million was used to retire the outstanding balance on our previous term loan 
we believe that these credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our current operational  capital investment and acquisition plans 
through september   we marketed pharmaceutical products directly to patients throughout our network and we had contracted with ivpcare  inc 
to provide certain business services related to the distribution of and accounting for these sales 
effective october   this agreement was terminated and replaced by a new agreement between us and ivpcare  inc 
under the terms of the new agreement  we are no longer a direct distributor of pharmaceutical products to patients as this function is being performed directly by ivpcare 
our responsibilities are limited to marketing the products for which we will be compensated 
this compensation will approximate our previous contribution from those pharmaceutical sales and services  and will be shown on a net rather than gross basis 
as a result  as of october   we no longer record pharmaceutical sales  the related cost of sales and other costs related to pharmaceutical distribution 
we anticipate significant decreases in revenues and cost of sales  however assuming the same volume of pharmaceutical products is distributed contribution from operations and income before income taxes  as well as net income  will be virtually unaffected from this contract change 
effective january   we signed a fertilitypartner agreement to supply a complete range of business  marketing and facility services to the reproductive partners medical group  inc  or rpmg  a fertility practice comprised of six physicians in the southern california market 
under the terms of this year agreement  our service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of rpmg s earnings 
we also committed up to million to fund any necessary capital needs of the practice 
on january   we signed a fertilitypartners agreement with the seattle  washington based seattle reproductive medicine  inc  ps  or srm  physician practice 
under the terms of this year agreement  our service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of srm s earnings 
we also committed up to million to fund the construction and equipping of a new state of the art facility to house the clinical practice and embryology laboratory for srm and its patients 
based on the terms of this transaction  we were paid a fixed service fee for approximately eleven months of until the new facility was fully operational in december upon becoming fully operational  our service fees reverted to the fee structure described above 
on september   we signed a fertilitypartners agreement with the charlotte  north carolina based reproductive endocrinology and andrology of charlotte  or reach  physician practice 
under the terms of this year agreement  our service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of reach s earnings 
we also committed up to million to fund the construction and equipping of a new state of the art facility to house the clinical practice and embryology laboratory for reach and its patients 
during  we negotiated revised fee structures on three of our existing fertilitypartner contracts 
all three of these revisions provided for phased in fee reductions  or fee capitations  on that portion of our fee structure which is based on the earnings of the underlying fertility centers 
we believe that these fee limitations will be offset by volume based increases in fees due to organic growth at fertilitypartner locations  the sale of new fertilitypartner contracts and growth in our shared risk refund business unit 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions which affect the reporting of the results of operations  financial position and related cash flows 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most critical estimates and judgment 
we base these estimates on historical experience  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we also continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and may revise them as conditions warrant 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of integramed america  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
we principally derive our revenues from contracts with fertility centers  fees from patients enrolled in our shared risk refund program and the sale of pharmaceutical products 
we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the medical practices to which we provide services and as such do not consolidate their results 
financial statement reclassifications as our business grows  it is often necessary to modify the organizational structure and adopt new business concepts 
these changes are reflected in the presentation of our current financial statements and  for comparative purposes  require us to reclassify information from our prior year financial statements to our current presentation 
among the prior year statements which have been reclassified to our current presentation are our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations  consolidated statements of shareholders equity and various supporting schedules 
revenue and cost recognition fertilitypartners service fees under all eight of our fertilitypartner agreements  we receive as compensation for our services a three part fee comprised of i a tiered percentage of the fertility centers net revenues  ii reimbursed costs of services costs incurred in servicing a fertility center and any costs paid on behalf of the fertility center and iii a fixed percentage of the fertility centers earnings after services fees  which may be subject to limits 
all revenues from fertilitypartners contracts are recorded in the period services are rendered 
direct costs incurred by us in performing our services and costs incurred on behalf of the medical practices are reported as costs of services 
revenue and costs are recognized in the same period in which the related services have been performed 
affiliate service fees under all eighteen of our affiliate agreements  we receive as compensation for our services a fixed fee dependent upon the level of service provided 
all revenues and costs from affiliate contracts are recorded in the period services are rendered 
shared risk refund program the shared risk refund program consists of a fertility treatment package that includes a fixed number of treatment cycles for one fixed price with a significant refund if the patient does not take home a baby 
we receive payment directly from consumers who qualify for the program and pay contracted fertility centers a defined reimbursement for each treatment cycle performed 
partial revenue is recorded upon the initiation of treatment  with remaining revenues recorded upon patients becoming pregnant 
a reserve is maintained for potentially refundable amounts if patients do not take home a baby 
expenses related to the program are recorded as incurred 
pharmaceutical sales revenues and related expenses from pharmaceutical sales are recorded upon shipment to customers 
prior to october   these revenues represented the actual sales value of the pharmaceuticals sold and we recorded cost of sales equal to the product cost 
subsequent to the october  amendment to our marketing agreement  our revenues are comprised of marketing fees related to these pharmaceutical sales as previously described in item  under the caption major events impacting financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our most significant estimates include a reserve for estimated refunds due to pregnancy loss in our shared risk refund program and the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
due to medical practices due to medical practices represents the net amounts owed by us to medical practices contracted as fertilitypartners 
this balance is comprised of amounts due to us by the medical practices for funds which we advanced for use in financing their accounts receivable  less balances owed to the medical practices by us for undistributed physician earnings and patient deposits we hold on behalf of the medical practices 
exclusive service rights exclusive service rights represent payments we made for the right to service certain fertility centers and are valued at cost less accumulated amortization 
costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the length of the service contract  usually ten to twenty five years 
we periodically review our exclusive business service rights to assess recoverability  a charge would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations if an impairment was determined to have occurred 
recoverability is determined based on undiscounted expected earnings from the related business over the remaining amortization period 
long lived assets under current accounting standards our long lived assets are subject to annual impairment testing and we may be subject to impairment losses as a result 
if we record an impairment loss  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year in which the impairment is recorded 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of net revenue represented by various expenses and other income items reflected in our statement of operations for the years ended december   and revenues  net provider services consumer services total revenues costs of services incurred provider services consumer services total costs of service contribution provider services consumer services total contribution general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense total other expenses income from operations before income taxes income tax provision net income compared to our revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in significant factors contributing to this increase were i provider services revenues from our fertilitypartners centers increased by million  or from the prior year 
approximately million of this increase came from our two most recently added fertilitypartners in seattle and southern california who joined our network on january   and january  respectively 
organic growth of at our other six fertilitypartner clinics  including million in service fees earned from the captive insurance company  accounted for the remaining million of revenue growth in versus we attribute much of this organic growth to targeted marketing campaigns directed towards prospective patients 
revenues from our affiliate clinics were approximately million in  slightly below revenues of million in while the number of affiliated clinics grew from in december  to by december  reported revenues for are slightly below the prior year figure due to a decrease in certain marketing related services 
ii consumer services our shared risk refund program continued to see significant year to year growth with revenues of million  an increase of million  or  above revenues of million 
the prospect of a potential refund  coupled with good treatment outcomes  as compared to industry averages  has resulted in continued strong patient enrollment in this program throughout our network 
pharmaceutical revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
this reduction in revenue is entirely the result of a change in contract terms we initiated with our strategic partner in the pharmaceutical business 
while these new contract terms will affect our revenue and related costs  it will have no impact on our margins or income 
as a result  reported revenues for are not directly comparable with results 
our contribution of million increased approximately million  or from as a percentage of revenue  our contribution margin increased to in versus in the following factors had a significant impact on contribution i provider services contribution from our fertilitypartners centers increased by million  or  to million in  from million in the prior year 
our two most recently added fertilitypartners locations in seattle and southern california generated million of increased contribution 
contribution at our remaining six fertilitypartners was approximately million less in than in despite higher revenues  due to the planned phase in of fee reductions at three clinics which has been previously disclosed  the contribution declined 
contribution earned from providing certain administrative services to the captive insurance company totaled approximately million in  its first year of operation 
our affiliate clinics generated contribution of million in  consistent with their contribution in  despite slightly lower revenue resulting from a reporting change 
ii consumer services contribution from our shared risk refund program rose by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in higher patient volume and favorable pregnancy outcomes  especially during early treatment cycles  helped drive this performance 
pharmaceutical contribution was million in  up million  or  from million in this increase in contribution  driven by increased product shipments  is a result of our continuing efforts to distribute our pharmaceutical services throughout our expanding network base 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of salaries  benefits  corporate regulatory  operational and support costs not specifically related to our clinics or other product offerings 
these expenses increased million in  over levels 
approximately million of this increase relates to planned headcount and compensation increases required to generate and support our growing revenue streams 
sarbanes oxley and other regulatory compliance efforts contributed an additional million of increased costs in versus as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in  up slightly from in interest income increased to  for the year ended december   from  in this increase is primarily attributed to interest income earned on capital investments at several fertilitypartner clinics 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  in  primarily as a result of interest charges on the outstanding portion of our revolving line of credit  and increases in the general level of interest rates 
our provision for income tax was approximately million in  compared to million in we paid no federal income tax in either  or  as we were able to utilize some of our net operating loss generated in prior years 
our effective tax rate for was approximately and reflects a provision for both state and federal taxes 
compared to revenues for the year ended december   increased by million  or  from the year ended the main factors contributing to this increase were i provider services revenues from our fertilitypartners centers increased by million  or from the same period in revenues for include million from a fertilitypartner agreement we terminated on june   and million from a new fertilitypartner in charlotte  nc  which was signed on september  revenues in include million from our charlotte  nc  fertilitypartner  and million from a new fertilitypartner in seattle  wa  who joined our network on january  the five fertilitypartners who were members of our network for the full reporting periods of and  had organic revenue growth of million  or in  versus we attribute much of this growth to our direct to consumer marketing efforts  backed up by our published laboratory success rates 
revenues from our affiliate clinics totaled million in  up from million in this increase in revenue is primarily the result of an increase in program membership fees instituted in january  as well as a net increase of one clinic participating in our affiliate program between december and december ii consumer services shared risk refund revenue grew by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the year earlier period 
we credit this sales growth to strong consumer acceptance and our continued market penetration of this innovative program 
pharmaceutical revenue was million for the year ended december   down million from revenue of million in the prior year 
this decline was due to our decision to de emphasize the sale of certain high volume products due to adverse product cost and pricing issues within the market 
these issues primarily impacted results during the first two quarters of  and sales of these products were reintroduced during the second half of the year 
our contribution for was million  up approximately million  or from a contribution of million in as a percentage of revenue  our contribution margin was in versus in the following factors had a significant impact on contribution i provider services contribution at our fertilitypartner program of million in was million  or higher  than contribution of million

contribution from affiliate clinics was million for the year ended december   up million  or from million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of membership fee increases instituted in january ii consumer services contribution from our shared risk refund program was million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  or  from its level of million 
this increase was the result of higher patient enrollment in the program  coupled with pregnancy success rates which met or exceeded  our expectations 
pharmaceutical contribution was million in  was approximately equal with contribution in contribution growth was hampered by our decision to de emphasize the sale of certain high volume products due to adverse product cost and pricing issues within the market  which have since been resolved 
general and administrative expenses were million in  up approximately million  or  from million in increased general and administration costs were largely the result of additional marketing expenses designed to boost patient volume at out fertilitypartner locations  as well as costs associated with new regulatory compliance requirements 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in  down slightly from in interest income increased to  for the twelve months ended december   from  in this increase is primarily the result of to interest earned on capital investments at several fertilitypartner clinics which experienced new facility build outs  or extensive facility expansions  in interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  in  primarily as a result of interest charges on the outstanding portion of our revolving line of credit 
our provision for income tax was approximately million in  and million in we made no federal income tax payments in either  or  due to the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years 
our effective tax rate for was approximately  which reflects a provision for both state and federal taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin r revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  vie s which replaced fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  issued in january fin r addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or vie s  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand as compared to million at december  additionally  we had working capital of approximately million  at december   an increase of million from working capital of million as of december  our increased liquidity is partially attributed to our renewed financing agreement with bank of america which was signed december   and increased our term loan outstanding by approximately million 
shared risk refund patient deposits  which are reflected as a current liability  represent funds received from patients in advance of treatment cycles 
these deposits  which represent prepayments of future revenues from patients without full insurance coverage totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these deposits are a significant source of recurring cash flow and represent interest free financing for us 
as of december   we did not have any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets or construction of leasehold improvements  however  we have budgeted upcoming capital expenditures of approximately million for these expenditures are primarily related to the expansion of our existing fertilitypartners centers 
we believe that working capital and  specifically  cash and cash equivalents remain at adequate levels to fund our operations 
we also believe that the cash flows from our operations plus our available credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our future liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
in december  we amended our existing credit facility with bank of america 
the amended facility is comprised of a million three year revolving line of credit and a million year term loan 
as of december   the full million of the term loan was outstanding with a remaining term of years 
proceeds of approximately million from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding balance on our previous term loan with bank of america 
each component of this amended credit facility bears interest by reference to bank of america s prime rate or libor  at our option  plus a margin  which is dependent upon a leverage test  ranging from to in the case of libor based loans 
prime based loans are made at bank of america s prime rate and do not contain an additional margin 
interest on the prime based loans is payable monthly and interest on libor based loans is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
as of december   interest on both the term loan and revolving credit line were payable at a rate of approximately 
unused amounts under the working capital revolver bear a commitment fee of and are payable quarterly 
availability of borrowings under the working capital revolver is based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   under the revolving line of credit the full amount of million was available  of which none was outstanding 
the bank of america credit facility is collateralized by all of our assets 
as of december   we were in full compliance with all applicable debt covenants 
we are also continuously reviewing our credit agreements and may renew  revise or enter into new agreements from time to time as deemed necessary 
significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years notes payable     capital lease obligations    operating leases      fertilitypartners capital and other obligations   total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years lines of credit   we also have commitments to provide working capital financing to our fertilitypartners locations 
a significant portion of this commitment is our transactions with the medical practices themselves 
our responsibilities to the medical practices are to provide financing for their accounts receivable and to hold patient deposits on their behalf as well as undistributed physician earnings 
disbursements to the medical practices generally occur on or before the th business day of each month 
the medical practice s repayment hierarchy consists of the following i we provide a cash credit to the practice for billings to patients and insurance companies  ii we reduce the cash credit for clinic expenses that we have incurred on their behalf  iii we reduce the cash credit for the base portion of our service fee which relates to the fertilitypartners revenues  iv we reduce the cash credit for the variable portion of our service fee which relates to the fertilitypartners earnings  and v we disburse to the medical practice the remaining cash amount which represents the physicians undistributed earnings 
we are also responsible for the collection of the fertilitypartners accounts receivables  which we finance with full recourse 
we continuously fund these needs from our cash flow from operations and the collection of the prior month s receivables 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  we could draw on our existing working capital line of credit 
we also make payments on behalf of the fertilitypartners for which we are reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  we do not make other advances to the medical practice 
we have no other funding commitments to the fertilitypartners 
new accounting pronouncements share based payments in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires that all share based compensation  including current grants and the unvested portion of stock options previously issued  is to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair value as of date of issue 
this statement is effective for the fiscal year beginning january   and is expected to increase our general and administrative expense  and reduce pre tax income by approximately  for the year ending december   based on unvested stock options currently outstanding 
non monetary assets in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting changes in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections which replaces apb opinions no 
and sfas no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
