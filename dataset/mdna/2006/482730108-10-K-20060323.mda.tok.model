item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction we are engaged in one principal business segment material handling equipment and systems 
we operate in two primary geographic locations north and south america the americas and europe  the middle east  africa and asia emea asia 
within the material handling equipment and systems segment  we have two main business or product lines business lines  which are our process and size reduction business lines 
the process business line is a combination of our former feeder and pneumatic conveying business lines 
in compared with  customers of our size reduction business line  particularly coal fired power generation plants  increased their spending on capital equipment 
at the same time  sales of our process business line declined  largely due to lower spending by customers in emea asia 
management looks at trends in what it believes to be relevant indicators  such as the pmi index for manufacturing published by the institute of supply management and similar foreign indices  to help it better understand the prospects for capital equipment spending as it may affect our process business line 
these indicators remained positive throughout  with fluctuating monthly values 
historically  increases in our feeding equipment sales generally have lagged improvements in these indicators  in some cases by as much as six to twelve months 
we believe  based in part on independent market studies  that we are the global leader in the design  production  marketing and servicing of high quality industrial feeders for the handling of bulk solids in a wide variety of manufacturing processes 
markets served include the plastics  food  chemical  detergent and pharmaceutical industries 
the majority of the revenues and profits of our k tron process business line is generated by equipment and systems sales  with a lesser amount attributable to service  parts and repairs 
feeders are sold under the k tron feeders brand name both domestically and in other countries around the world 
new product innovation is a major objective of the r d efforts of this business 
in our process business line we have the ability to serve nearly all geographic regions of the world from our two assembly and test facilities in pitman  new jersey and niederlenz  switzerland and our sales and service offices in france  germany  the united kingdom  singapore and china service only 
our pneumatic conveying equipment  sold under the k tron pcs and k tron colormax brand names  comprises a relatively small portion of the total revenues of our process business line 
this equipment is sometimes sold through the k tron process group in conjunction with feeder equipment as a means of transporting dry material from one part of a plant to the inlet of a feeder  and in other cases the equipment and complete systems are sold in applications that do not necessarily incorporate feeders  primarily in the united kingdom 
aside from selling into markets common to those for industrial feeders  pneumatic conveying equipment is also sold into the plastics injection molding market 
factors affecting the sale of pneumatic conveying equipment are similar to those which affect feeder equipment but also include factors that may affect the secondary plastics market generally 
our size reduction business line was added with the purchase of penn crusher and jeffrey on january  in contrast to our process business line  penn crusher and jeffrey sell equipment primarily into the us market  with some sales into foreign countries  particularly china 
the main industries served are the electric utility  mining  pulp and paper and wood and forest products industries  and a majority of revenues and profits are generated from replacement part sales instead of new equipment 
both penn crusher and jeffrey have developed and currently maintain an extensive digital database of previously sold equipment  including equipment specifications and drawings  that enables them to respond quickly and efficiently to fill customers spare parts orders 
significant indicators that management uses to judge prospects for this business line in the us include the level of electricity consumption  the financial health of the electric utility industry and the demand for paper and forest products 
with our acquisition of gundlach in march  our size reduction business line was expanded to include a leading provider of size reduction equipment to the coal mining industry  both in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended december   january  and january  critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in certain areas 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include determinations of the useful lives of assets  estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets  determinations of the adequacy of reserves for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs  and legal contingencies 
there are a number of critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
we base our critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the most critical assumptions made in arriving at our accounting estimates are the following depreciable lives of plant and equipment each asset included in plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of such asset from earnings every year over such asset s estimated economic useful life 
net plant and equipment at year end totaled  which represented of total assets 
depreciation expense during totaled  which represented of total operating expenses 
given the significance of plant and equipment and associated depreciation to our financial statements  the determination of an asset s economic useful life is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
economic useful life is the duration of time the asset is expected to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
management s assumptions regarding the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life changes in technology  wear and tear and changes in market demand 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its continued appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  technological advances  excessive wear and tear or reduced estimates of future demand for a product may result in a shorter estimated useful life for an asset than originally anticipated 
in such a case  we would depreciate the remaining net book value of the asset over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
conversely  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life would decrease depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
over the past three years  changes in economic useful life assumptions have not had a material impact on our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
we record a provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  management analyzes the creditworthiness of specific customers and the aging of customer balances 
management also considers contractual rights and obligations and general and industry specific economic conditions 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to establish the allowance can change from time to time  and uncollectible accounts could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 
asset impairment determinations as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
under this accounting standard  goodwill is subject to an impairment test that we conduct at least annually using a discounted cash flow technique 
the impairment test done in indicated that the fair value of the business with goodwill exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  the goodwill amount was not impaired 
with respect to our other long lived assets  we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset has been impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in analyzing the future cash flows of various assets  the assumptions we make include the following the intended use of assets and the expected cash flows resulting directly from such use  industry specific economic conditions  customer preferences and behavior patterns  and the impact of applicable regulatory initiatives  if any 
we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
over the past three years  we have not recognized any asset impairments 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of liabilities and assets measured using the enacted tax rate 
our income tax expense was  with a effective tax rate for the year ended  and included a fourth quarter tax provision of  for taxes incurred in connection with the one time repatriation of  from our swiss subsidiary to its us parent company 
this repatriation was made under and in accordance with the american jobs creation act of significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable tax contingency in accordance with statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments 
deferred tax assets are recorded for deductible temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are insufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of these items  these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense 
a one percentage point increase in the company s effective tax rate for from to would have decreased reported net income by approximately  inventory obsolescence we record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
in calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve  management analyzes historical data regarding customer demand  product changes  market conditions and assumptions about future product demand 
management believes that its accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because customer demand can be variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could materially affect our financial results 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated warranty cost of a product at the time revenue is recognized 
warranty expense is normally accrued as a percentage of sales on a monthly basis  and this provision is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
there is an exception to this for certain products within the size reduction business for which we use a combination of historical information and management judgment 
we offer a one year product warranty on a majority of our products 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including the active monitoring and evaluation of the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by actual product failures and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our warranty provision is established based upon our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty provisions are adequate and that the judgments applied are appropriate  the ultimate cost of product warranty could differ materially from our estimates 
when the actual cost of warranty of our products is lower than we originally anticipated  we adjust downward the recorded reserve  and if the cost of warranty repairs and service is higher than anticipated  we increase the reserve 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this estimate has been developed by management and may be made in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and also with our insurance consultant  and it is based upon an analysis of potential results  including litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by litigation outcomes that are significantly different than our assumptions and estimates 
results of operations overview fiscal and were week years  while fiscal was a week year 
in  and  we reported revenues of   and  and net income of   and we believe that the increases in our revenues and net income in compared to were primarily the result of stronger business conditions and increased spending by our customers in the americas  especially with respect to our size reduction business line  which more than offset lower spending by overseas customers of our process business line 
our effective tax rate was  up from in this increase was primarily due to a higher proportion of us income in  which was taxed at higher rates  and a fourth quarter tax provision of  arising from the one time repatriation under the american jobs creation act of of  from our swiss subsidiary as previously described above 
the tax on the  repatriation added to our effective tax rate for  increasing it from to 
net income for benefited from a  pre tax profit contribution from the first quarter sale of an office building by one of our united kingdom subsidiaries and from the favorable impact of a  fourth quarter german tax benefit described in the next paragraph  which tax benefit also lowered our effective tax rate for we believe that the increases in our revenues and net income compared to were primarily the result of improved business conditions and increased spending for capital equipment by customers in many of the markets served by our business lines 
an additional favorable factor was the effect of the weaker us dollar in versus on the translation of the revenues and profits of our foreign operations into us dollars 
our effective tax rate was  down from in due primarily to the favorable impact of a  fourth quarter tax benefit resulting from the reduction of a previously established tax reserve following the settlement and closure of a tax audit in germany  partially offset by a higher proportion of us income which was taxed at higher rates 
net income for also benefited from a  pre tax profit contribution from the first quarter sale of an office building by one of our united kingdom subsidiaries 
acquisitions on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of penn crusher 
as a result of this purchase  we also acquired jeffrey  a wholly owned subsidiary of penn crusher 
the purchase price for the penn crusher stock was  paid at closing  a post closing adjustment of  based on penn crusher s consolidated stockholders equity at december  and  in the quarter ended january  in conjunction with the company s irs code section h election relating to such acquisition 
of this amount   was paid in cash and  was in unsecured promissory notes which were payable in equal  annual installments on january of  and with respect to the payment of the cash portion of the purchase price and related acquisition costs other than the section h election  we financed  through a  secured credit facility with penn crusher as the borrower and jeffrey as the guarantor with the additional  being available for working capital and general corporate purposes  subject to certain limitations  and the lender has no recourse against any other k tron company with respect to any amounts borrowed thereunder except by a non recourse pledge of the stock of penn crusher 
additionally  we borrowed  from a us bank through the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron process group and used these funds to pay part of the purchase price 
this obligation was guaranteed by k tron international  inc  and k tron international also issued the  of unsecured promissory notes that were payable to the former penn crusher stockholders 
in june  k tron international prepaid the  of unsecured promissory notes 
the prepayment of these notes was financed with a  term loan from a us bank  payable over months  with monthly principal payments of  beginning in january  monthly principal payments of  beginning january and a final principal payment of  in december the term loan is guaranteed by the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron process group 
as noted above  k tron and penn crusher incurred substantial debt as a result of the penn crusher acquisition 
this debt  including the amounts outstanding at the end of  is described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section of this item k tron and penn crusher have met all required principal and interest payments on this debt  and in and penn crusher also made principal prepayments of  and  on one of the two term loans included as part of its secured credit facility 
in january  penn crusher made a  principal prepayment on the same term loan  thereby paying off the remaining balance of that loan 
foreign exchange rates we are an international company  and we derived approximately  and of our  and revenues from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities located outside the us  primarily in europe 
with our global operations  we are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange rates  which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into us dollars as well as transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies  such as sales made from our swiss manufacturing facility in currencies other than the swiss franc 
with the acquisition of penn crusher and jeffrey  we are less affected by foreign exchange rates since most of their sales are in us dollars 
nevertheless  we still derive substantial revenues from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities outside the us  so that we will continue to have significant sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
since we have received substantial revenues in recent years from activities in foreign jurisdictions  our results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly in us dollar exchange rates with respect to the swiss franc  euro and british pound sterling and  to a lesser degree  the singapore dollar and other currencies 
when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales increases 
when the non us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales decreases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  our revenues in us dollars generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide  especially those identified above 
in particular  a general weakening of the us dollar against other currencies would positively affect our revenues  gross profit and operating income as expressed in us dollars provided that the gross profit and operating income numbers from foreign operations are not losses  since in the case of a loss  the effect would be to increase the loss  whereas a general strengthening of the us dollar against such currencies would have the opposite effect 
in addition  our revenues and income with respect to particular sales transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale 
for  and  the changes in certain key foreign exchange rates affecting the company were as follows fiscal year average us dollar equivalent of one swiss franc change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year presentation of results and analysis the following table sets forth our results of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  as well as our year end backlogs fiscal year total revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest expense gain on sale of office building income before income taxes year end backlog at year end foreign exchange rates  in thousands of dollars total revenues increased by  or in compared to we believe that this increase was primarily attributable to stronger business conditions and increased spending by our customers in the americas  especially with respect to our size reduction business line 
this increase was partially offset by lower spending by overseas customers of our process business line and  to a lesser degree  the negative effect of a slightly stronger us dollar in on the translation of the revenues of our foreign operations into us dollars  which reduced foreign revenues by approximately  compared to what those revenues would have been using exchange rates 
total revenues increased by  or in compared to we believe that this increase was primarily attributable to improved business conditions which resulted in increased capital equipment spending by our customers in many of the markets served by both our process and size reduction business lines and  to a lesser degree  to the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues of our foreign operations into us dollars 
the favorable impact of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately  or  of the  revenue increase in compared to gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in and in these increases reflected a change in the sales mix of the material handling products sold within our two business lines 
sales mix refers to the relative amounts of different products sold and services provided 
gross margin levels vary with the product sold or service provided 
for example  sales of replacement parts in the size reduction business line generally carry a higher gross margin than do sales of equipment within that line 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in by  or compared to the increase in was primarily the result of higher sales commissions related to increased revenues and one time costs associated with certain staff reductions  partially offset by a lower employee bonus accrual  lower sarbanes oxley costs and the negative effect of a slightly stronger us dollar on the translation of foreign costs into us dollars 
sg a expenses increased by  or in compared to this increase was primarily the result of a higher employee bonus accrual  higher sales commissions related to increased revenues  the effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of foreign costs into us dollars  and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the implementation of new software systems by the k tron process group 
research and development r d expense decreased by  or in compared to the decrease was primarily due to the second quarter layoff of one r d employee and lower prototype expenditures 
research and development expense decreased by  or in compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower prototype expenditures and a small reduction in staff  partially offset by the effect of a weaker us dollar when translating swiss r d costs into us dollars 
r d expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in there was no significant r d expense associated with the penn crusher and jeffrey businesses 
interest expense decreased by  or in compared to and by  or in compared to these decreases were the result of lower debt levels in each year  partially offset by higher interest rates on some of our debt 
in the first quarter of  one of our united kingdom subsidiaries sold its office building for  and realized a pre tax gain of  all employees were relocated to a nearby office building that is leased by another united kingdom subsidiary 
income before income taxes was  in   in and  in the changes during the periods were the net result of the items discussed above 
the income before income taxes was substantially higher than in primarily because of stronger business conditions and increased spending by our customers in the americas  especially with respect to our size reduction business line  which more than offset lower spending by overseas customers of our process business line and  to a lesser degree  the negative effect of a slightly stronger us dollar in the income before income taxes was substantially higher than in primarily because of improved business conditions in many of the markets served by our business lines and  to a lesser extent  from the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues and profits of our foreign operations into us dollars 
the  and provisions for income tax were   and  and the overall effective tax rates were in  in and in the higher effective tax rate in compared to was due primarily to a higher proportion of us income in which was taxed at higher rates and an additional fourth quarter tax provision of  arising from the one time repatriation under the american jobs creation act of of  from our swiss subsidiary  as previously described 
the tax on this repatriation added to our effective tax rate in  raising it from to 
another reason for the higher effective tax rate in compared to was that included a  tax benefit resulting from the fourth quarter reduction of a previously established tax reserve following the settlement and closure of a tax audit in germany 
the lower effective tax rate in compared with was primarily due to the  fourth quarter tax benefit described in the previous sentence  partially offset by a higher proportion of us income which was taxed at higher rates 
we have foreign and us state tax loss carryforwards of  and  which  if realized  would have an estimated future net income benefit of approximately  and  we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during the last three years 
our order backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by  or at the end of compared with year end  from  to  our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by  or at the end of compared with year end  from  to  these increases in our backlog were primarily the result of the improved business conditions in our size reduction group 
a significant part of our backlog at the end of consisted of orders that were expected to be shipped within days 
approximately  of the penn crusher backlog at the end of was for blanket orders that can be released by the customer at any time over an month period compared to approximately  of such blanket orders at the end of liquidity and capital resources penn crusher acquisition debt in connection with our acquisition of penn crusher  we borrowed  from a us bank through the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron process group  which loan was combined with an outstanding term loan from that bank to that subsidiary and resulted in a new  term loan 
monthly principal payments of  plus interest at a fixed rate of on approximately half the loan and at a variable rate of one month libor plus on the other half at december  began in february  with the final principal payment of approximately  plus interest being due in january this loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the us manufacturing subsidiary and is guaranteed by k tron international  inc at december   there was  outstanding under this term loan facility 
the term loan facility requires that k tron international comply with certain covenants relating to consolidated debt to net worth ratio  minimum annual debt coverage and minimum net worth 
at the time of the acquisition  penn crusher borrowed  from another us bank consisting of  in term debt  with a five year term and  with a six year term and  under a five year revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  the revolving credit facility provides for up to  of total availability  including the  originally borrowed thereunder 
there was nothing borrowed under the revolving credit facility as of december  quarterly term debt principal payments of  began march  and increase each year by  per quarter or  per year in the aggregate through december   with final quarterly principal payments of  in in and we prepaid  and  that was due in on the  term debt 
interest is based on one to six month libor plus to  and the to was reduced to to after penn crusher met certain financial ratios 
as of december   there was  outstanding on the five year term loan and  outstanding on the six year term loan 
in january  we prepaid the remaining  on the six year term loan 
in january  penn crusher entered into an interest rate swap related to the entire  five year term loan  remaining as of december  such that interest cannot exceed for the full term of the loan and this limit was reduced to in after penn crusher met certain financial ratios 
the interest rates on the outstanding balances under the  term loan and the  term loan were and as of december  the penn crusher debt is guaranteed by jeffrey and secured by substantially all of the assets of penn crusher and jeffrey  but it is not guaranteed by any other k tron company except by a non recourse pledge of the stock of penn crusher 
the term loans and revolving credit facility require that penn crusher comply with certain covenants relating to tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
in addition to the above borrowings  k tron international issued  of unsecured promissory notes to the former penn crusher stockholders as part of the penn crusher purchase price 
these notes were payable in three equal  annual installments beginning january on the second  third and fourth anniversaries of the january  closing date 
interest at per annum was payable quarterly 
in june  k tron international prepaid the  of unsecured promissory notes that were payable to the former penn crusher stockholders 
the prepayment of these notes was financed with a  term loan from a us bank  repayable over months  with monthly principal payments of  beginning january  monthly principal payments of  beginning january and a final principal payment of  in december interest is payable monthly at a fixed rate of per annum on a portion of the debt  as of december  and a variable rate of one month libor plus as of december  on the remaining portion  as of december  
the term loan is guaranteed by the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron process group 
other bank debt at december   our swiss subsidiary had separate credit facilities totaling  swiss francs approximately  with three swiss banks 
the company s real property in switzerland is pledged as collateral 
as of december   there were no borrowings under any of these credit facilities 
in june  the us manufacturing subsidiary of the k tron process group refinanced its year mortgage debt with a us bank for  at an annual interest rate of 
in july  the annual interest rate was reduced to and  beginning august   this loan became payable in eighty three monthly principal and interest payments of  each  with a final payment of  plus interest due on august  as of december   the principal amount owed on this borrowing was also in june  this same us manufacturing subsidiary entered into a two year secured revolving credit facility with the us bank that holds the mortgage 
as of december   there was  borrowed under this credit facility  which has now been extended through july  and  was available for future borrowings 
interest is payable monthly at the prime rate as defined and determined monthly by the bank minus one half percent 
the interest rate as of december  was 
on march   we purchased all of the outstanding stock of jmj industries  inc  which operates its business under the trade name gundlach 
the purchase price was  of which  was paid in cash and  by delivery of an unsecured  promissory note bearing interest at per annum and payable in three equal  annual installments of  on march in each of  and we also paid off all of the acquired company s bank debt  which amounted to approximately  we did not borrow any money in connection with either the acquisition or the payoff of the bank debt 
future payments under contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt  lease and purchase obligations 
the table below summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of december  for the items indicated payment due by period dollars in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total in addition to these obligations  the company has employment contracts with seven executives 
except in one case when two years advance notice is required  these contracts may be terminated by the company with one year s advance notice 
under these agreements  each individual is guaranteed minimum compensation over the contract period 
as of december   the estimated future obligation under these contracts  if all of them were to be terminated at one time  was  payable within a one year period

total debt decreased by  in  of total net debt repayments  partially offset by an increase of  due to the effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of our foreign debt 
other items at the end of and  our working capital was  and  and the ratio of our current assets to our current liabilities was and 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash from operating activities 
in and  we utilized internally generated funds and our lines of credit to meet our working capital needs 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in   in and  in the decrease in operating cash flow in compared to was primarily due to lower accrued expenses  partially offset by higher net income and lower accounts receivable 
the increase in operating cash flow in compared to was primarily due to increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
most of the changes resulted from the stronger business conditions and higher revenues discussed above 
net income and depreciation and amortization were the principal components of cash provided by operating activities in all three years 
the average number of days to convert accounts receivable to cash was days in compared to days in and days in the average number of days to convert inventory into cost of sales was days in compared to days in and days in net cash used in investing activities was   and  in  and capital expenditures were   and  in  and  which included significant expenditures for the development and implementation of customer relationship management crm and enterprise resource planning erp software systems for the k tron process group in and spending on the erp system implementation was essentially complete as of january  and a majority of the spending on the crm was also complete by that date 
funds used in to acquire penn crusher were  in the first quarter of  we sold our uk office building and received  of proceeds 
cash used in financing activities in and was for the net reduction of debt  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the  borrowed to finance the penn crusher acquisition  net of debt reduction 
cash and short term investments increased to  at the end of versus  at the end of and  at the end of shareholders equity increased  in to  of which  was from net income   was from the issuance of common stock pursuant to restricted stock grants and the exercise of stock options and  was from an unrealized gain  net of taxes  on an interest rate swap  partially offset by a reduction of  from changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the translation of swiss francs into us dollars  between the beginning and the end of forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks related to i fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and ii interest rate changes 
foreign exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the swiss franc  the us dollar versus the euro  the us dollar versus the british pound sterling  the swiss franc versus the euro and the swiss franc versus the british pound sterling 
we do not  as a routine matter  use hedging vehicles to manage foreign exchange exposures 
foreign currency debt is used as necessary in switzerland and the united kingdom where the company does business  thereby reducing our net asset value exposure 
in addition  foreign cash balances in currencies other than the swiss franc are limited in order to manage the transaction exposure caused by the marking to market of non swiss franc balances to swiss franc values on the balance sheet of our swiss subsidiary 
as of december   a unfavorable change in the foreign exchange rates affecting balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately  this hypothetical reduction on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december  actual foreign exchange rates and hypothetical rates assuming a unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates on that date 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as translation adjustments ta within shareholders equity on the balance sheet 
using the example above  the hypothetical change in ta would be calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a unfavorable change in the applicable foreign exchange rates 
the result of this calculation would be to reduce shareholders equity by approximately  or of our december  shareholders equity of interest rate risk we have several credit facilities or loans that require us to pay interest at a rate that may change periodically 
these variable rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if short term interest rates rise 
we limit our exposure to increased interest expense from rising short term interest rates by including in our debt portfolio various amounts of fixed rate debt as well as by the use of an interest rate swap 
as of year end  we had total debt of   of which was fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of   of which was subject to variable interest rates which ranged from to and  of which was variable rate debt subject to an interest rate swap with the result that the interest rate was fixed at  subject to possible reduction 
this rate was reduced in to after our penn crusher subsidiary achieved a targeted ratio of debt to ebitda 
a basis point increase in interest rates on the  of variable rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately
