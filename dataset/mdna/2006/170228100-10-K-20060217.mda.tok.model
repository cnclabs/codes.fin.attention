item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december    and the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and selected statistical information included in this report 
application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be the most critical in their potential effect on its financial position or results of operations allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses consists of two components the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge against current earnings to the provision for credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
there are three components of the allowance for loan losses specific reserves for loans considered to be impaired or for other loans for which management considers a specific reserve to be necessary  allocated reserves based upon management s formula based process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and a non specific environmentally driven allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of other qualitative factors 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly reviewed by the company for adequacy using a consistent  systematic methodology which assesses such factors as changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in portfolio credit quality  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
adverse changes in management s assessment of these factors could lead to additional provisions for credit losses 
the company s methodology with respect to the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is more fully discussed in later sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
the reserve for unfunded commitments is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses on outstanding letters of credit  merchant processing activity and unused loan credit lines 
adequacy of the reserve is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  similar to the one which analyzes the allowance for loan losses 
management must also estimate the likelihood that these commitments would be funded and become loans 
this is done by evaluating the historical utilization of each type of unfunded commitment and estimating the likelihood that the current utilization rates on lines available at the balance sheet date could increase in the future 
mortgage servicing rights msrs 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through the sale of financial assets on a servicing retained basis 
capitalized servicing rights are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated regularly for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying servicing rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates  original loan terms and whether the loans are fixed or adjustable rate mortgages 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
when the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value  an impairment reserve is recognized so that each individual stratum is carried at the lower of its amortized book value or fair value 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot 
table of contents recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
income taxes 
the company estimates its income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates to determine an appropriate expense against current pre tax earnings 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as timing of the deduction of expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   there were no valuation allowances set aside against any deferred tax assets 
interest income recognition 
interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is not accrued on loans days or more past due unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection or on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
all loans considered impaired are nonaccruing 
interest on nonaccruing loans is recognized as payments are received when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all unpaid interest previously accrued is reversed against current period interest income  therefore  an increase in loans on nonaccural status could have an adverse impact on interest income recognized in future periods 
restructuring charges 
the company recognizes restructuring charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges  which contain specific guidance regarding the types of  and circumstances under which  certain expenses can be accrued 
in general  the statements require that the company have a detailed plan in place  which has been communicated to substantially all the employees affected 
significant management judgment is required in estimating the amount of expense that is appropriate to recognize in relation to these plans 
executive overview chittenden posted net income of million  compared with million in diluted earnings per share were  an increase of from specific highlights included net interest income increased million or from this increase was driven by higher levels of interest earnings assets  which increased to million in  as well as to an increase of basis points in the net yield on earning assets to in the provision for credit losses of million was  higher than in due to continued strong loan growth 
however  both and were considered low in comparison to the recent past 
the provision for credit losses ranged from million to million in the lower levels of provision for credit losses in the last two years have been due to significantly lower net charge offs 
credit quality continued to be strong in net charge offs were very low at million in compared with million in during  net charge offs ranged from million to million 
non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned declined to basis points  the lowest level during the last five years 
total loan footings increased million  or  during the increase was attributable to continued growth across all loan categories  particularly in the commercial industrial and commercial real estate portfolios  residential real estate loans  and municipal loans 
this loan growth was more than funded by higher levels of deposits  which were up million  or  year over year 

table of contents noninterest income declined million from several categories saw declines including investment management and trust million  service charges on deposits million  gains on sales of loans  and insurance commissions 
these declines were partially offset by improved mortgage servicing million and credit card income 
these fluctuations are more fully explained on page noninterest expenses increased million or just from salaries and employee benefits increased million or 
it is important to note that in the second quarter of  the company decided to change the delivery mechanism  effective january   for its employees pension benefit by redirecting it through the company s k plan 
this decision resulted in the immediate recognition of million in deferred credits relating to previous pension plan changes made in the mid s

in addition  the company experienced growth of in its municipal portfolio and in the construction portfolio 
the primary emphasis in the construction portfolio is the financing of projects for the company s commercial 
table of contents customers  as well as individual consumer loans 
at december   the construction portfolio was comprised of approximately in individual consumer construction loans  in loans to commercial customers for owner occupied properties  for commercial customers for investor properties  and to residential developers 
the continued growth came primarily from the company s vermont  massachusetts and new hampshire markets and was not specifically concentrated in any one industry 
the following graph shows the industry diversification  which are based on naics sector codes  of the commercial loan portfolios at december  logo residential real estate loans 
residential real estate loans  comprised of family and home equity lines of credit  totaled billion at december   an increase of million from the increase is primarily attributable to the home equity lines of credit  which totaled million at december  compared with million at the end of and growth of million from the prior year end in family loans which was primarily due to the increased production of private banking loans in our vermont  massachusetts and maine markets 
approximately or million of the residential real estate loans are private banking loans  which are nontraditional interest only loans 
consumer loans 
consumer loans were million  at december   an increase of million from approximately of these loans were indirect installment loans while the remaining loans consisted of direct installment and revolving credit 
all of the company s indirect installment loans were originated from dealers within the banks operating areas 

table of contents mortgage banking operations residential mortgage sales during totaled million  compared to million during this decline was primarily due to the origination of lower volumes of fixed rate residential loans caused by gradually increasing market rates during and lower volumes of refinancing activity 
the company underwrites its residential mortgages to secondary market standards and sells substantially all of its fixed rate residential mortgage production on a servicing retained non recourse basis 
the portfolio of residential mortgages serviced for investors totaled billion at december  compared to billion at year end these assets are owned by investors other than chittenden and therefore are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the net assets relating to this servicing portfolio recorded on the company s books at december  and were million and million  respectively 
as noted under the application of critical accounting policies  the company evaluates the msr asset for impairment on a regular basis 
at december   the msr s amortized cost of million was reduced by an impairment reserve of  as compared to an impairment reserve of million at the end of nonperforming assets loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
management classifies loans as nonaccrual when they become days past due as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
in addition  loans that have not met this delinquency test may be placed on nonaccrual at management s discretion 
to the extent that certain loans classified as nonaccrual have an associated governmental agency guarantee  a separate assessment of the classification of the guaranteed portion is made 
generally  as long as interest and principal are less than days past due  the guaranteed amounts are collectible from the guarantor and therefore are not classified as nonaccrual 
in these situations  only the non guaranteed portion of the loan would be classified as nonaccrual 
in the event that a guaranteed loan were to exceed days past due  no further interest would be accrued on the guaranteed portion  as it generally would not be reimbursed by the guarantor 
consumer and residential loans are included when management considers it to be appropriate  based upon evidence of collectibility  the value of any underlying collateral and other general criteria 
generally  a loan remains on nonaccrual status until the factors which indicated doubtful collectibility no longer exist or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when its interest rate is reduced and or other terms are modified because of the inability of the borrower to service debt at current market rates and terms 
other real estate owned oreo is real estate that has been acquired through foreclosure and is recorded at the lower of the carrying amount of the loan or the fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell  at the time of acquisition

adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  which analyzes the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
in addition to evaluating the collectibility of specific loans when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management also takes into consideration other factors such as changes in the mix and size of the loan portfolio  historic loss experience  the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified  and economic trends 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific loss allocations are made against certain adversely classified loans  and general loss allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio which have similar attributes 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against current earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
while management uses available information to assess possible losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in non accrual loans  changes in economic conditions  growth in loan portfolios  or for other reasons 
any future additions to the allowance would be recognized in the period in which they were determined to be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examinations 
such agencies may require the company to record additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 

table of contents credit quality of the commercial portfolios is quantified by a corporate credit rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk 
individual loan officers monitor their loans to ensure appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis 
risk ratings and quality of commercial and consumer credit portfolios are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent credit review department 
credit review personnel conduct ongoing portfolio trend analyses and individual credit reviews to evaluate loan risk and compliance with corporate lending policies 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
consumer and residential real estate loan quality is evaluated on the basis of delinquency data and other credit data available due to the large number of such loans and the relatively small size of individual credits 
allocations for these loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses 
in each category  inherent losses are estimated based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
in addition  certain loans in these categories may be individually risk rated if considered necessary by management 
the other method used to allocate the allowance for loan losses entails the assignment of reserve amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the company will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based on internal risk ratings or non accrual status 
a specific reserve amount is allocated to an individual loan when that loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimable on the basis of its collateral value  the present value of anticipated future cash flows  or its net realizable value 
at december   impaired loans with specific reserves totaled  all of these loans were on nonaccrual status and the amount of such reserves was  the adequacy of the reserve for unfunded commitments is determined similarly to the allowance for loan losses  with the exception that management must also estimate the likelihood of these commitments being funded and becoming loans 
this is done by evaluating the historical utilization of each type of unfunded commitment and estimating the likelihood that the current utilization rates could increase in the future

table of contents management strives for directional consistency between its provision for loans losses and the quantitative and qualitative indicators of its asset quality 
in  the provision was increased approximately  primarily due to higher levels of commercial charge offs and the onb acquisition 
in  the provision was reduced by million  primarily due to improved credit quality evidenced by much lower net charge offs  which declined million 
this trend continued in when the provision declined million to million  primarily due to significantly lower net charge offs  which declined million from in  the provision increased  primarily due to continued strong commercial loan growth 
the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans has declined from at year end to at december  as a result of the sustained period of lower net charge offs and due to continued improvements in the ratios of nonperforming assets to loans plus oreo 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated to various loan categories for analytical purposes as part of the company s process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the increased allocations to these categories reflected growth in the portfolios 
the other category is the allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of historical loss experience  industry trends  and the impact of the local and regional economy on the company s borrowers that have not been captured in the specific risk classifications 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing environmental conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the company s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
prior to the company s recognition in of a separate reserve for unfunded commitments  a portion of the other category was reserved for inherent losses in the off balance sheet exposures  which are now recognized in the separate liability 
the amount of the other allocation at december  reserved for this purpose was approximately million

the frb  fdic and occ have defined leverage capital requirements  which measure tier capital as defined below against average total assets without regard to risk weighting 
additionally  these regulators have a risk based capital standard 
under this measure of capital  banks are required to hold more capital against certain assets perceived as higher risk  such as commercial loans  than against other assets perceived as lower risk  such as residential mortgage loans and us treasury securities 
further  off balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit are included for purposes of determining risk weighted assets 
commercial banking organizations are required to have total capital equal to of risk weighted assets  and tier capital consisting of common stock and certain types of preferred stock  including the tps  equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
tier capital  included in total capital  includes the allowance for possible loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 

table of contents fdic and occ regulations pertaining to capital adequacy  which apply to the banks  require a minimum leverage capital ratio for those institutions with the most favorable composite regulatory examination rating 
in addition  a tier risk based capital ratio  and an total risk based capital ratio are required for a bank to be considered adequately capitalized

on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that would retain trust preferred securities in tier capital of bank holding companies  but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer standards 
the final rule provides a five year transition period  ending march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities would be limited to percent of tier capital elements  net of goodwill 
the company has evaluated the potential impact of such a change on its tier capital ratio and has concluded that it would remain well capitalized under the new rules 
in june  the central bank governors of the member countries of the basel committee approved a revised capital adequacy framework generally known as the basel ii framework 
the basel ii framework is a three pillar capital adequacy approach versus the flat of risk weighted assets as defined currently used 
the basel ii framework also permits qualifying bank institutions to use more advanced approaches for measuring operational risk and credit risk 
in order to address competitive equity issues for community and regional banking organizations that could arise under the bifurcated regulatory capital framework following the implementation of the basel ii framework  the united states bank regulatory agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr in october  known as basel ia  which would make some aspects of the basel ii framework applicable in modified form to smaller banks 
it remains uncertain whether the rules will be adopted and  even it adopted  how closely the final basel ia rules will resemble the rules described in anpr and what the effective date of such rules will be

financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of their customers and to reduce their own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the banks are parties to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  held for purposes other than trading 
the financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument  for loan commitments and standby letters of credit  is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments  assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that collateral or other security is of no value 
the banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they do for on balance sheet loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the banks upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
commitments to originate loans  unused lines of credit  and unadvanced portions of commercial real estate and construction loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the amounts presented below do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are issued primarily to support public and private borrowing 
table of contents arrangements  bond financings  and similar transactions

the decline was a result of lower investment management and trust income  lower service charges on deposits and lower levels of gains on sales of securities  net of losses on prepayments of borrowings 
partially offsetting these declines were higher mortgage servicing and other income 
investment management and trust income declined million from primarily due to lower annuity sales

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
since the company has no trading operations  risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices are not significant 
interest rate risk  including mortgage prepayment risk  is the single most significant non credit risk to which the company is exposed 
to measure the sensitivity of its income to changes in interest rates  the company uses a variety of methods  including simulation  and gap analyses 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board of directors  which reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying exposures  quantifying them and taking appropriate actions 
the company uses simulation analyses to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a relatively short ie  within one year time horizon 
simulation analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario 
these assumptions are the basis for projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets and liabilities under various scenarios 
simulation analysis may have certain limitations caused by market conditions varying from those assumed in a model 
actual results can often differ due to the effects of prepayments and refinancings of loans and investments  as well as the repricing or runoff of deposits  which may be different from that which has been assumed 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately  up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the next twelve months should not be impacted by 
table of contents greater than 
an additional analysis is performed to review results if interest rates were to shift quarterly  ramped up or down and basis points over a twelve month period 
the results of these simulations are shown below interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  in thousands immediate net interest income ramped net interest income changes in interest rates changes in interest rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps bps policy limit policy limit as noted above  one of the tools used to measure rate sensitivity is gap analysis 
the gap is defined as the amount by which a bank s rate sensitive assets exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
this indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period 
this mismatch will improve earnings in a rising rate environment and inhibit earnings when rates decline 
conversely  when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the gap is referred to as negative 
in this case  a rising rate environment will inhibit earnings and declining rates will improve earnings 
notwithstanding this general description of the effect on net interest income of the gap position  it may not be an accurate predictor of changes in net interest income 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
the following table shows the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that reprice during the periods indicated repricing date one day to six months over six months to one year over one year to five years over five years total in thousands interest earning assets loans investment securities interest bearing cash equivalents total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap at december  cumulative gap as a of total assets cumulative gap at december  cumulative gap as a of total assets loans include loans held for sale
