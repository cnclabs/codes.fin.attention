the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s statements of operations as a percentage of total net sales 
year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill total operating expenses operating loss other income expense net loss critical accounting policies our discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from insignia popsigns ratably over the period of service  which is either a two week or four week display cycle 
we recognize revenue related to equipment  software and sign card sales at the time the products are shipped to customers 
revenue associated with maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
revenue that has been billed and not yet recognized is reflected as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors could result in materially different amounts 

table of contents income taxes 
the company records income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
at december   all of the company s net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance  which amounted to million 
the company cannot be certain that it will be more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized in future years 
accrued retailer guarantees 
the company has contracts with many retailers that provide for the retailer to be paid on a per sign basis for the services rendered by the retailer to hang the company s popsigns in their respective stores 
some of the retailer contracts provide for minimum annual payment amounts 
if those minimum levels are not met based upon the annual activity with those retailers  the company is obligated to pay the contractual difference to the retailers 
excess amounts to be paid are computed and recorded on a monthly basis and paid on either a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
these amounts are included as expense within cost of services and thus affect the company s gross profit margin 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pursuant to the provisions of apb  the company generally does not record an expense for the value of stock based awards granted to employees 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r share based payment 
sfas r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its financial statements 
sfas r will be effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal january

acquisition in december  the company acquired all of the assets comprising the valustix business from paul a 
richards  inc  a new york company par  for  in cash  plus a five year royalty based on annual net sales over a threshold amount  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement between the company and par 
the company was not successful in integrating the valustix business into the pops program during and based on a number of factors and therefore made a decision to de emphasize that business 
utilizing discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of the valustix business  the company determined that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded the fair value of the business 
as a result  the company wrote off the goodwill associated with the acquisition of  in the fourth quarter of and  second quarter of the primary factor leading to the impairment was the continued inability of the valustix acquisition to generate positive cash flow from operations 
as of december   there is no goodwill remaining associated with the valustix acquisition 
in september  the company brought a suit against par and paul richards in federal district court in minneapolis  minnesota asking that the acquisition be rescinded and all parties restored to their pre acquisition status 
an agreement in principle has been reached to settle the suit 
the company has recorded no liability at december  related to this matter and would not have a liability under the agreement in principle 
the company expects to resolve this matter in the second quarter of
