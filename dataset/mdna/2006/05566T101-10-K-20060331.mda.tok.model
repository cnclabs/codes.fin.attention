executive summary growth  expansion  and funding trends 
quality people  high growth markets  and a strict dedication to asset quality are the underlying principles of our expansion efforts 
in the first quarter of  we moved our high point loan production operation into a full service  permanent facility 
this was the first office to go from loan production office to full service facility 
the second loan production office in salisbury moved its operations to a full service banking facility during the first quarter of this model has been highly successful and very profitable for our company and shareholders  and we anticipate utilizing this model in other markets going forward 
in  we opened commercial loan production offices in winston salem and harrisburg  north carolina 
in early  we plan to open a loan production office in northern davidson county located on the outskirts of metro winston salem 
we anticipate both the harrisburg and northern davidson county offices to move into full service facilities in or early the common theme with all of our expansion efforts is finding great bankers of high character and technical skills in high growth markets 
we have looked at acquisition opportunities over the past three years  but until our proposed transaction with sterlingsouth  none had the ingredients that we require solid management  common philosophy on service  and a great market 
in early  the company announced the signing of definitive agreement to acquire sterlingsouth in greensboro  north carolina 
sterlingsouth had approximately million in assets at december   and conducts its business from three offices in the dynamic greensboro metro market 
combining the highly attractive greensboro market and a management and lending team made up of seasoned veterans  all having over years of banking experience  made this transaction a great fit strategically 
we anticipate closing this transaction in early july of trends 
beginning in  the company began expanding our footprint into new markets using loan production offices as an entry vehicle 
loan production offices were opened in high point in the second quarter of  and in salisbury in the fourth quarter of each of these offices was successful in growing their respective loan portfolios to over million in loans outstanding by the end of  and both have been converted into full service offices 
with the success of the loan production office model  the company opened loan production offices in the cities of winston salem and harrisburg  north carolina in and the company s loan portfolio has more than doubled from the million reported on december   to december   when total loans were million 
in this three year period  rates have been at historically low levels 
management has made a conscious effort to pursue variable rate pricing on a predominance of this new growth in the loan portfolio  thereby experiencing a shift in our portfolio mix from fixed at the end of  to variable at the end of as rates have risen over the past months  the rates on these variable rate loans have increased concurrently  and have contributed to a strong rise in the bank s yield on earning assets 
over the same time period  management has utilized the wholesale cd markets to attract and lock in longer term funding 
this longer term funding  terms of months to five years  carried a higher cost in the short term  but as rates have risen substantially over the past months  this strategy has helped to hold down the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
with rates at a level that is approaching neutral as defined by the federal reserve open market committee  management and the board of directors have worked to formulate and execute a strategy to reduce our company s asset sensitive position 
in the fourth quarter of  the company executed a million notional swap transaction whereby we are paying prime rate variable and received a fixed rate of for five years 
this effectively turned the interest stream on million of our prime based loan portfolio into a fixed interest stream at 
this was the first in a series of planned moves to reduce the rate sensitivity in our balance sheet now that the future direction of rates in not as clear cut as was the case in and the primary driver of our gains in net income have come from a  and growth in the loan portfolio  net of allowance for loan losses  in  and  respectively 
in addition to driving a and increase in net interest income in and  respectively  the expansion over the past three years also served to provide greater diversification of our loan portfolio into markets less dependent on manufacturing 
in  the thomasville and lexington offices accounted for of the company s total loan portfolio  compared to at the end of these markets continue to be very sound banking markets  however  with the current employment volatility in the manufacturing sectors  management is continuing to look at rapidly growing markets outside davidson county that provide diverse industries and economic drivers 
in and early  as we originated variable rate loans and funded with longer term deposits  the company s net interest margin declined from in to in however  the bank s net interest income increased  or million in compared to by accepting a slightly smaller net interest margin  the bank was able to accelerate the growth of our loan portfolio  price our loans and deposits to take advantage of future rate increases  and still report record increases in our net interest income 
each of these results was expected as part of the strategic plan implemented during in  as rates rose steadily  the investment we made in longer term funding  with the sacrifice in short term yield we experienced by stressing variable rate credits began to pay significant dividends 
in  the company s net interest margin increased to and net interest income increased by million  or 
with assets growing at a compounded annual rate of over the past three years  it was imperative that part of our on going strategic plan be devoted to capital planning 
as noted in prior reports  the company has utilized alternative forms of regulatory capital to supplement our shareholders equity in order to remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
the company has issued three blocks of year variable rate junior subordinated debentures to its wholly owned capital trusts million in april of priced at month libor  million in march of priced at month libor  and million in september of priced at month libor 
these debentures fully and unconditionally guarantee the preferred securities issued by the trusts 
these debentures are classified as long term debt on our company s financial statements 
in addition  during the second quarter of  the bank issued million of subordinated debentures priced at month libor  which is classified as tier ii capital for regulatory purposes 
during  in addition to increases in long term debt  total shareholders equity increased by million  or 
the company reported net income of million  and repurchased stock amounting to  as part of the stock repurchase plan approved by the board of directors 
the company repurchased  shares on the open market  at prices and block sizes in accordance with the provisions of the stock repurchase plan and relevant securities laws 
all capital ratios continue to place the bank in excess of the minimum required to be deemed a well capitalized bank by regulatory measures 
the bank has maintained liquidity at what it believes to be an appropriate level 
liquid assets  consisting of cash and demand balances due from banks  interest earning deposits in other banks  investment securities available for sale and fhlb stock  ended the year in the aggregate at million  or of total assets 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb  has an investment of million in fhlb stock 
the bank s investment in premises and equipment increased by million as a result of the cost of finishing our full service office in high point and the construction costs associated with our full service office in salisbury 
as part of the acquisition of independence bank  the company recorded goodwill of million  which is not amortizable 
the  in core deposit intangible associated with that transaction has a carrying balance of  at december  the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized into expense over ten years 
net interest margin trends 
with rates at historically low levels  the bank made a conscious decision to limit the growth of our fixed rate loan portfolio over the past three years 
while these fixed rate credits provide short term spread  they would have provided a less favorable impact on the company s earnings stream as the federal reserve increased short term rates over the past months 
in  the bank reported total loan growth of over million 
during the year  variable rate loans increased by million  while fixed rate loans increased by million 
as would be expected  in a rising interest rate environment  the market rate for variable rate loans adjusted each time the federal reserve increased its benchmark rates  and resulted in the bank s yield on earning assets increasing throughout the funding for the loan growth in  unlike in when funding came primarily from wholesale funding sources  was comprised of both local and wholesale funds 
in  we were actively seeking longer term funding  which was not readily available in our local markets 
for efficiency and availability of these longer term funds  we were forced to utilize the wholesale markets almost exclusively 
in  when our targeted terms for new funding changed to months or less  we were able to tap our local markets and generate local deposit growth  primarily with terms of eight months to months 
this local deposit growth was led by the opening of our full service office in high point in the first quarter  and the expanded awareness of our salisbury office during the second half of when local deposit growth was not sufficient to meet short term funding requirements  we continued to use the wholesale markets to acquire or to obtain funding with terms of six months to months 
as management and the board looks ahead to  it is uncertain how long and at what pace the federal reserve will continue to raise short term interest rates 
we are positioning our balance sheet and interest income stream to partially participate in future rate moves  while reducing our exposure to a sharp drop in rates 
these strategic initiatives now in place management believes are a prudent way to protect the long term income stream of our company 
financial condition december  and the most significant factor affecting the bank s growth in was the million increase in net loans 
this total increase was composed principally of an increase of million in loans secured by real estate other than construction  an increase of million in loans secured by construction purpose real estate and a decline of million in loans to individuals for consumer purposes 
the bank has maintained liquidity at what it believes to be an appropriate level 
liquid assets  consisting of cash and demand balances due from banks  interest earning deposits in other banks  investment securities available for sale and fhlb stock  ended the year in the aggregate at million  or of total assets 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb  has an investment of million in fhlb stock 
the bank s investment in premises and equipment increased by million as a result of the cost of completing our full service office in high point and the cost of construction of our full service office in salisbury 
as part of the acquisition of independence bank  the company recorded goodwill of million that is not amortizable 
the  in core deposit intangible associated with that transaction has a carrying balance of  at december  the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized into expense over ten years 
funding to support higher total assets held at year end was provided by an increase of million in deposit accounts  a decrease of million in short term borrowings  and an increase of million in long term debt 
the increase in deposit accounts was due to an increase of million in certificates of deposit 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased by million in  and at year end included million in large denomination certificates of deposit obtained through the wholesale markets 
these certificates had maturities ranging from six months to five years at rates at or below those being quoted in the local markets at the time of closing 
smaller denomination time deposits  which come primarily from within our local markets  increased by million 
during  total shareholders equity increased by million  or 
the company reported net income of million  and repurchased  shares of stock amounting to  as part of the stock repurchase plan approved by the board of directors 
the stock was repurchased on the open market  at prices and block sizes in accordance with the provisions of the stock repurchase plan and relevant securities laws 
all capital ratios continue to place the bank in excess of the minimum required to be deemed an adequately capitalized bank by regulatory measures

net interest income increased by million  or  in  while non interest income decreased by  or 
the net increases in income exceeded the million increase in non interest expenses  which totaled million in as compared with million in net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the primary component of earnings for the bank is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as levels of non interest bearing liabilities 
during the years ended december  and  average interest earning assets were million  and million  respectively 
during these same years  the bank s tax effected net yields on average interest earning assets were and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin from to was due primarily to two factors with the federal reserve raising short term interest rates steadily throughout  the company benefited from having of its loan portfolio with variable rate pricing 
the constant repricing of over of our loan portfolio helped to increase our yield on earning assets and ultimately increase net interest margin 
as short term rates increased  the increases were not as pronounced on rates paid on premium money market accounts 
the company had over million in premium money market balances  whose rates adjusted upwards approximately of the move in the prime rate 
this helped to control the rise in the interest expense on the company s interest bearing deposits during table and table following this discussion  average balances and net interest income and volume and rate analysis  respectively  presents an analysis of the bank s net interest income and rate volume activity for and as described above  the primary component of earnings for the bank is net interest income

with both yield on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities increasing  the bank s net interest margin increased by five basis points 
for the year ended december  the net interest margin was  while for the year ended december   the net interest margin was a slightly lower 
provision for loan losses 
the bank recorded a million provision for loan losses in  representing an increase of million from the million provision made in provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management 
in evaluating the allowance for loan losses  management considers factors that include growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors 
in both and the provision for loan losses was made principally in response to growth in loans and to cover charge offs 
net loan growth totaled million in and million in the allowance for loan losses  as a percentage of loans outstanding  declined from at the beginning of to at the end of the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  an increase of  or from the million at the end of at december  and  the bank had  and  in nonaccrual loans  respectively 
the nonaccrual balance at december  has been written down to a balance that management believes is collectible under normal market conditions 
net loan charge offs for were million or of average loans outstanding during the year 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or

the fee income from the company s mortgage origination unit decreased in to  from  in service charges on deposits and other services in were million  an increase of  or  when compared to the million in this increase was essentially growth related 
table following this discussion presents a comparative analysis of the components of non interest income 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the million reported for substantially all of this increase resulted from the bank s growth and development during and  including the opening and staffing of the full service office in high point  expanded staffing in the loan production offices in both salisbury and winston salem  and staffing of the harrisburg loan office 
personnel costs increased by  or  with the majority of this increase attributable to paying the salaries of the lenders and support staff at the new full service and loan production offices 
in addition  with the bank experiencing asset growth of for the year  the necessary support staff also increased

during the years ended december  and  average interest earning assets were million  and million  respectively 
during these same years  the bank s tax effected net yields on average interest earning assets were and  respectively 
the decline in the net interest margin from to was due primarily to two factors the company s loan portfolio  which grew by million during  had its variable rate portfolio increase by million  which carries a lower rate than comparable loans with a fixed rate of interest 
the fixed rate loan portfolio actually decline during by million 
the disadvantage associated with the lower rates on variable rate loans are weighted against the positives associated with the ability of these variable rate loans to reprice upwards as rates increase 
in order to provide future pricing mobility of these loans  considering the historically low interest rate environment in which the bank operated during  the majority of loans originated in carried variable rate pricing 
the bank experienced a flat year in terms of growth in the non interest bearing demand account balances 
this area provides the bank with interest free money to supplement and offset the costs associated with fully funding loans through time deposits 
with no growth in the non interest bearing sector  the bank was very dependent on growth from the wholesale funding sector 
the bank utilized the wholesale funding markets to increase wholesale time deposits with terms of months to months by million in  while short term advances from the fhlb that reprice daily increased by million

the fee income from the company s mortgage origination unit decreased in to  from million in the historically low rates on conventional mortgage loans during the two year period ending in the fourth quarter of caused mortgage origination income from refinancing activity to reach unsustainable levels 
mortgage origination volumes declined to more normal levels in  resulting in a significant decline in mortgage fee income 
in early  the bank began to offer sub prime mortgage products as a way of supplementing our product mix and expanding our revenue sources 
these mortgages are underwritten and approved by a correspondent bank  and the bank obtains a written commitment to sell these loans prior to relaying the commitment to the customer 
while there is generally greater risk associated with sub prime lending  since the bank is not involved in underwriting decisions and closes these loans on a pre sold basis  the risk to the bank is minimized significantly

table following this discussion presents a comparative analysis of the components of non interest income 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million over the million reported for substantially all of this increase resulted from the bank s growth and development during and  including the opening of loan production offices in both salisbury and high point  and the costs of advancing technology needed to make our branch delivery system customer friendly 
personnel costs increased by  or  with the majority of this increase attributable to paying the salaries of the lenders and support staff at the two new loan production offices opened in  and the hiring of the staff for the high point office expected to open in early in addition  with the bank experiencing asset growth of for the year  the necessary support staff also increased 
table following this discussion presents a comparative analysis of the components of non interest expenses 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million in and million in represents and  respectively  of income before income taxes 
these effective rates are lower than the blended federal north carolina statutory rate of principally due to tax exempt income from municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance 
liquidity the bank s sources of funds are deposits  cash and demand balances due from other banks  interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities available for sale 
these funds  together with loan repayments  are used to make loans and to fund continuing operations 
in addition  at december   the bank had credit availability with the fhlb of approximately million  with million outstanding at december  total deposits were million  and million at december  and  respectively 
as a result of the company s loan growth exceeding local deposit growth  the bank utilized its wholesale funding sources  such as borrowings from the fhlb and the wholesale cd market 
due to the availability of funds and a wide range of terms available in the wholesale cd market  the bank raised million in out of market time deposits in at december  and time deposits represented and  respectively  of the company s total deposits 
certificates of deposit of  or more represented and  respectively  of the bank s total deposits at december  and at december   the company had no funds from public municipalities and million in wholesale time deposits 
management believes that most other time deposits are relationship oriented 
while the bank will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
based upon prior experience  the bank anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity 
management anticipates that the bank will rely primarily upon customer deposits  loan repayments and current earnings to provide liquidity  and will use funds thus generated to make loans and to purchase securities  primarily securities issued by the federal government and its agencies  municipal securities and mortgage backed securities 
in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the bank that will require future cash outflows 
in addition there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit that may or may not require future cash outflows 
table following this discussion  contractual obligations and commitments  summarizes the bank s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  capital resources at december  and  the company s tangible shareholders equity totaled million and million  respectively 
the company s tangible equity to asset ratio on those dates was and  respectively 
these ratios are above regulatory minimums necessary to be classified as well capitalized  and show continued effort in our plan to leverage tangible equity capital to better enhance our return on average tangible equity 
the company and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements 
see part  item description of business supervision and regulation 
all capital ratios place the bank in excess of the minimum required to be deemed adequately capitalized by regulatory measures 
during  the bank s total capital to risk weighted assets ratio fell below the threshold to be considered a well capitalized institution as a result of the high concentration of cash paid in the independence transaction 
the company s wholly owned capital trust issued million in trust preferred securities during the first half of to re establish the bank s capital levels to well capitalized 
the company s capital trusts issued million of year trust preferred securities during  while the bank issued million of subordinated debentures in to augment regulatory tier i and tier ii capital 
the bank s tier i leverage ratio as of december  and was and  respectively 
note o to the accompanying consolidated financial statements presents an analysis of the company s and bank s regulatory capital position as of december  with the anticipated issuance of additional trust preferred securities or subordinated debentures  to be treated as tier ii capital  after december   management expects that the bank will remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes throughout  although there can be no assurance that the bank will not fall into the adequately capitalized classification 
asset liability management the bank s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the bank s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the bank s earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the bank maintains  and has complied with  an asset liability management policy approved by the board of directors of the bank and the company that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analysis liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
this policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the bank has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily us treasury securities  securities issued by governmental agencies  mortgage backed securities and securities issued by local governmental municipalities 
the securities portfolio contributes to the bank s  and thus the company s profits  and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability techniques to actively manage the balance sheet 
the primary objectives in the overall management of the securities portfolio are safety  yield  liquidity  asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits or as collateral for fhlb advances 
in reviewing the needs of the bank with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  the bank s management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayments on loan and loan backed assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of december   looking forward for months  the bank would expect an increase in net interest income of million if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points and a decrease in net interest income of million if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points 
when factoring in other interest sensitive revenues and costs  such as the income derived from mortgage originations  the effect of a basis point rise will produce a net increase in interest sensitive income of million  while a decline in rates of basis points will result in a reduction in interest sensitive income of million 
the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is another standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk 
the management believes that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
table following this discussion  interest rate sensitivity analysis sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are projected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
money market deposit accounts are considered rate sensitive and are placed in the shortest period  while negotiable order of withdrawal or other transaction accounts are assumed to be more stable sources that are less price elastic and have been placed in the longest period 
in making the gap computations  none of the assumptions sometimes made regarding prepayment rates and deposit decay rates have been used for any interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the table does not reflect scheduled principal payments  which will be received throughout the lives of the loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions 
table illustrates that if assets and liabilities reprice in the time intervals indicated in the table  the bank is asset sensitive within three months  liability sensitive within twelve months  and asset sensitive thereafter 
as stated above  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
for instance  while the table is based on the assumption that money market accounts are immediately sensitive to movements in rates  the bank expects that in a changing rate environment the amount of the adjustment in interest rates for such accounts would be less than the adjustment in categories of assets that are considered to be immediately sensitive 
the same is true for all other interest bearing transaction accounts 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
due to these shortcomings  the bank places primary emphasis on its income simulation model when managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
lending activities general 
the bank provides to its customers a full range of short to medium term commercial  mortgage  construction and personal loans  both secured and unsecured 
the bank also makes real estate mortgage and construction loans 
the bank s loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing its lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the types of loans that the bank seeks  target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to the bank  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the boards of directors of the bank and the company 
the bank supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by internal loan examiners and outside professionals experienced in loan review work 
the bank has focused its portfolio lending activities on higher yielding commercial loans 
table following this discussion provides an analysis of the bank s loan portfolio composition by type of loan as of the end of each of the last five years 
table following this discussion presents  at december   i the aggregate maturities or repricings of loans in the named categories of the company s loan portfolio and ii the aggregate amounts of variable and fixed rate loans that mature or reprice after one year 
commercial loans 
commercial business lending is a major focus of the bank s lending activities 
at december   the bank s commercial and industrial loan portfolio equaled million or of total loans  as compared with million or of total loans at december  commercial and industrial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital  expansion  and other business purposes 
short term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or equipment 
the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by real estate  which are categorized as real estate loans 
lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength  management and credit history of the borrower  and the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment 
commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans 
more frequent repricing means that yields on our commercial loans adjust with changes in interest rates 
real estate loans 
real estate loans are made for purchasing  constructing and refinancing one to four family  five or more family and commercial properties 
real estate loans also include home equity credit lines 
the bank offers fixed and adjustable rate options and provides customers access to long term conventional real estate loans through its mortgage loan department which makes secondary market conforming loans that are originated with a commitment from a correspondent to purchase the loan within days of closing 
residential real estate loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank s residential mortgage loans are generally secured by properties located within the bank s market area 
many of the residential mortgage loans that the bank makes are originated for the account of third parties 
such loans are classified as loans held for sale in the financial statements 
the bank receives fees for each such loan originated  with such fees aggregating  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the bank anticipates that it will continue to be an active originator of residential loans for the account of third parties 
commercial real estate loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
this lending has involved loans secured principally by commercial buildings for office  storage and warehouse space  and by agricultural properties 
generally in underwriting commercial real estate loans  the bank requires the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt 
loans secured by commercial real estate may be in greater amount and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties 
the bank originates one to four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes where the home buyer is the borrower and provides financing to builders and consumers for the construction of pre sold homes 
the company generally receives a pre arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside entity prior to financing the construction of pre sold homes 
the company lends to builders who have demonstrated a favorable record of performance and profitable operations and who are building in markets that management believes it understands and in which it is comfortable with the economic conditions 
the company also makes commercial real estate construction loans  generally for owner occupied properties 
the company further endeavors to limit its construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures 
also  the company generally requires documentation of all draw requests and utilizes loan officers to inspect the project prior to paying any draw requests from the builder 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment on construction loans 
loans to individuals 
loans to individuals include automobile loans  boat and recreational vehicle financing and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans 
consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans  even if secured  because the collateral often consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles and equipment 
repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan 
consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss  illness and other personal factors 
the bank attempts to manage the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss 
commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of business  the bank enters into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in loans receivable  net  presented on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the bank applies the same credit standards to these commitments as it uses in all its lending activities and has included these commitments in its lending risk evaluations 
the bank s exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see table and note o to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
asset quality the bank considers asset quality to be of primary importance  and employs a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to its lending policy as approved by the bank s and the company s boards of directors 
it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is credit administration s responsibility to change the borrower s risk grade accordingly 
the function of determining the allowance for loan losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
in determining the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in the bank s market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank s policy regarding past due loans normally requires a prompt charge off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review 
further efforts are then pursued through various means available 
loans carried in a non accrual status are generally collateralized and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets table following this discussion sets forth  for the periods indicated  information with respect to the bank s nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans plus loans ninety days past due and still accruing  and total nonperforming assets 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on loans  unless we place a loan on nonaccrual basis 
the bank accounts for loans on a nonaccrual basis when it has serious doubts about the ability to collect principal or interest in full 
generally  the bank s policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due days 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status in cases where management is uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
the bank accrues interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates when management anticipates that no loss of original principal will occur 
potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above  but about which management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms 
these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual  past due or restructured loans  so they are considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses 
at december   the bank had identified  in nonaccrual loans  down from  at the end of restructured loans amounted to  at year end  and loans past due and still accruing totaled million compared to  at the end of real estate owned consists of foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties 
at december  and  there were  and  respectively  in assets classified as real estate owned 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
management increases allowance for loan losses by provisions charged to operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
the allowance is reduced by loans charged off 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
in addition  on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews the loan portfolio  conducts an evaluation of credit quality and reviews the computation of the loan loss allowance 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  management considers the growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors deriving from the bank s history of operations 
in addition to the bank s history  management also considers the loss experience and allowance levels of other similar banks and the historical experience encountered by our management and senior lending officers prior to joining us 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review allowance for loan losses and may require us to make additions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
no regulatory agency asked for a change in our allowance for loan losses during or management uses the risk grading program  as described under asset quality  to facilitate evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers and reviewed by credit administration  and tested by the bank s internal auditor 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  large loans  loans that are identified as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more and still accruing  and nonaccrual loans 
the bank strives to maintain the loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the bank s market area 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the bank has no foreign loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
management follows a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected 
a reserve range of is generally allocated to these loans  depending on credit quality 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable 
a reserve of is generally allocated to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted 
this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future 
as a practical matter  when loans are identified as loss they are charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the above classification categories  the bank also categorizes loans based upon risk grade and loan type  assigning an allowance allocation based upon each category 
growth in loans outstanding has  throughout the bank s history  been the primary reason for increases in the bank s allowance for loan losses and the resultant provisions for loan losses necessary to provide for those increases 
this growth has been spread among the bank s major loan categories  with the concentrations of major loan categories being relatively consistent from through over the two year period from through  there has been an increase in the concentration of real estate construction loans and real estate loans while there has been a decline in the percentage of the portfolio made up of commercial and industrial loans 
this reflects the real estate lending background and experience of our lenders and the growth opportunities in the salisbury and high point markets 
for the four fiscal years through  the bank s loan loss experience has seen net loan charge offs in each year of range from to of average loans outstanding 
for  net charge offs were of average loans outstanding as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in charge offs in were due to several factors a change in the bankruptcy laws in the third quarter resulted in numerous borrowers filing prior to the more restrictive laws became effective  and continued softening in the archdale and thomasville economies 
this resulted in charge offs for being for the year  slightly above our five year averages 
the bank s allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans outstanding  excluding loans held for sale 
the bank s allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans outstanding  excluding loans held for sale 
this decrease in the allowance relative to our gross loans has been significantly impacted by the continued improvement in the credit quality of loans acquired in the acquisition of another financial institution during many of the loans acquired in that business combination had a history of credit issues  which increased the level of the allowance allocated to those loans 
since the business combination  the company has made a concerted effort to readdress the collateral and cash flow requirements for these loans thereby improving their classifications 
this improvement has reduced the level of the allowance necessary for these loans 
management has determined that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
the bank makes specific allowances that are allocated to certain individual loans and pools of loans based on risk characteristics  as discussed below 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our portfolio  will not require an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
no regulatory agency asked for a change in our allowance for loan losses during or in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed herein 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the bank s and the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the bank s primary markets  including the counties of davidson  guilford  randolph  forsyth  rowan and cabarrus have historically been very heavily concentrated in textile  furniture  and heavy manufacturing 
with the competition from overseas  these industries have experienced significant plant closings and layoffs in our markets 
to this point  the retraction in the manufacturing base has had a minimal impact on our loan quality  except as noted in the thomasville and archdale markets 
however  if this trend continues  it could negatively impact the bank s asset quality 
table following this discussion shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the allocation is based on an evaluation of defined loan problems  historical ratios of loan losses and other factors that may affect future loan losses in the categories of loans shown 
table following this discussion sets forth for the periods indicated information regarding changes in the bank s allowance for loan losses 
investment activities the bank s portfolio of investment securities  all of which are available for sale  consists primarily of securities issued by local governmental municipalities 
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reflected as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
securities held for indefinite periods of time include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset liability management strategy and that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates and or significant prepayment risks 
it is the bank s policy to classify all investment securities as available for sale 
table following this discussion summarizes securities available for sale 
table following this discussion summarizes the amortized costs  gross unrealized gains and losses and estimated fair values of securities available for sale at december   and table following this discussion summarizes the amortized costs  fair values and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   by contractual maturity groups 
the bank does not engage in  nor does it presently intend to engage in  securities trading activities and therefore does not maintain a trading account 
at december   there were no securities of any issuer other than governmental agencies that exceeded of the company s shareholders equity 
sources of funds deposit activities 
the bank provides a range of deposit services  including non interest bearing checking accounts  interest bearing checking and savings accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
these accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits 
during  the bank s deposit mix reshifted due to customer preferences and asset liability pricing decisions by management 
interest bearing demand accounts declined by million  or  due to customers shifting their investment funds from this liquidity instrument into cd s and other short to intermediate term investments as these rates rose faster than money market or now accounts 
the bank had net growth of approximately million in wholesale time deposits and million in local time deposits 
this compares to million of net growth in wholesale time deposits in with rates at historically low levels in through the first half of  the bank chose to extend the average term of our time deposit portfolio 
in general  investors in the local markets are not interested in time deposits with terms of two years and longer 
the wholesale markets provide a very efficient source of long term funding at rates equal to or below those quoted at the local level 
borrowings 
borrowings provide an additional source of funding for the bank 
the bank may purchase federal funds through unsecured federal funds guidance lines of credit totaling million at december  these lines are intended for short term borrowings and are subject to restrictions limiting the frequency and terms of advances 
these lines of credit are payable on demand and bear interest based upon the daily federal funds rate 
the bank had no outstanding balance on the line of credit as of december  and an outstanding balance of million at december  as an additional source of borrowings the bank utilizes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  with balances outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one day from the transaction date and are collateralized by securities issued by local governmental municipalities 
the bank also uses advances from the fhlb of atlanta under a line of credit equal to of the bank s total assets million at december  
outstanding advances totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these advances are secured by a blanket floating lien on qualifying first mortgage loans and equity lines of credit 
a more detailed analysis of the bank s fhlb advances is presented in note f and note g to the consolidated financial statements 
table following this discussion sets forth for the periods indicated the average balances outstanding and average interest rates for each major category of deposits 
table following this discussion sets forth at the dates indicated the amounts and maturities of certificates of deposit with balances of  or more at december  table following this discussion sets forth for the periods indicated information regarding the company s borrowed funds 
market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market price and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
we do not maintain a trading account nor are we subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk is monitored as part of the bank s asset liability management function

critical accounting policy allowance for loan losses 
the company s most significant critical accounting policy is the determination of our allowance for loan losses 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and requires our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
what makes these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if the mix and amount of future write offs differ significantly from those assumptions we use in making our determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on our income statement could be materially affected
