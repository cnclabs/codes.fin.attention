item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data section of this report and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
introduction we manufacture  formulate and globally distribute specialty chemicals 
we operate businesses engaged in industrial wood preservation and agrochemicals  including animal health pesticides and agricultural chemicals 
our wood preserving chemicals  penta and creosote  are used by our industrial customers primarily to extend the useful life of utility poles and railroad crossties 
our animal health pesticides are used on cattle  swine and poultry to protect these animals from flies and other pests 
our agricultural chemicals include an herbicide used primarily for weed control in cotton and sugarcane fields and along highways 
approximately of our fiscal year revenues resulted from industrial wood preservation chemicals  with approximately of those revenues attributable to creosote and attributable to penta 
agrochemicals accounted for the remaining of our fiscal year revenues  with attributable to animal health pesticides and attributable to our agricultural chemicals 
our results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including fluctuations in sales volumes  raw material pricing and availability  our ability to acquire and integrate new products and businesses  and the difference between prices received by us for our specialty chemical products and the costs to produce those products 
raw material prices have increased over the past several years  including the cost of our primary raw materials  chlorine  phenol  creosote and cosolvent 
we have not always been able to pass these price increases on to our customers 
as a result  the margins for some of our products have been reduced 
our sales volumes  especially those of our wood preserving chemicals  have increased as we have consolidated our market position and due to the continued strong demand for utility poles and railroad crossties 
we experience large fluctuations in the quarterly sales volumes of our agricultural products due to seasonal agricultural patterns 
as a result  our sales and earnings are typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half 
acquisitions a key element of our business strategy is to acquire businesses and assets that operate in segments of the specialty chemical industry exhibiting those characteristics we believe provide us with opportunities to grow our company in a manner that increases shareholder value 
the acquisitions we have completed since are summarized below 
in february  we purchased certain assets of the animal health pesticides business of boehringer ingelheim 
the assets we purchased included pesticide registrations for pesticides used on cattle  swine  poultry and livestock premises  a manufacturing and warehouse facility in elwood  kansas and related equipment 
we also purchased the insecticides finished goods  raw materials and packaging inventory on hand at closing 
the pesticides registrations acquired in the transaction are for the united states  canada  australia  mexico and several other countries in latin america  and they complement our existing animal health pesticides registrations 
the new pesticides include a leading brand of insecticidal ear tags for cattle and several liquid and dust formulations for livestock and their premises 
through the end of fiscal year  boehringer ingelheim continued to market the purchased pesticides as our sole distributor in the united states pursuant to a transition agreement with us 
the purchase price was approximately million  including million of inventory 
we financed the acquisition entirely with available cash 
in june  we purchased certain penta assets from basic chemicals company  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of occidental chemical 
the assets we purchased included product registrations and data  manufacturing equipment and certain other assets 
the product registrations we acquired in the transaction are for the united states and canada 
following this acquisition  we became the sole producer of penta in north america 
basic chemicals company acquired the penta assets from vulcan materials company immediately prior to our purchase as part of a larger purchase of the chemicals business of vulcan materials company 
the purchase price was million  payable with million from available cash at closing  and a million promissory note 
the promissory note is payable in five equal annual principal installments of million plus interest at per annum 
in fiscal year  we made three acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in december  we purchased certain penta distribution assets of wood protection products 
as part of the purchase  we also granted an option to acquire  shares of our common stock  exercisable at per share 
the acquisition included distribution and plant equipment  inventory  penta product registrations and a consulting and non compete agreement with the principal shareholder of wood protection products 
we primarily financed the cash portion of the purchase price with a million term loan 
in june  we purchased creosote product registrations from trenton sales 
in connection with our purchase  we entered into a long term supply agreement with lufkin creosoting co  an affiliate of trenton sales  under which we sell lufkin creosoting its creosote requirements for its wood treating operations 
we also assumed trenton sales long term creosote supply agreement with a mexican producer of creosote 
although we had been purchasing creosote from the same mexican creosote producer prior to the acquisition  the acquisition increased our purchases of that lower cost creosote supply 
we also purchased the ravap trade name and inventory from boehringer ingelheim in june the creosote distribution and ravap acquisitions were completed using available cash  borrowings under our revolving loan and by increasing one of our senior term loans by million 
results of operations segment data segment data is presented for our four segments for the three fiscal years ended july   and you should read the foregoing segment data in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
year ended july  amounts in thousands revenues penta creosote animal health pesticides agricultural chemicals depreciation and amortization penta creosote animal health pesticides agricultural chemicals income loss from operations penta creosote animal health pesticides agricultural chemicals includes a non cash impairment charge of approximately million in fiscal segment revenue the net sales revenues of the penta segment increased by million  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year  or a increase 
approximately million of the increase came from additional sales of penta blocks to customers of vulcan materials company  certain of whose assets we acquired from basic chemicals company late in fiscal year the balance of the penta revenue increase came primarily from increased demand for penta treated poles from utilities 
creosote segment revenues increased by million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a increase 
our creosote revenues expanded in fiscal year on price increases as volume was down about as compared with fiscal year creosote volume decreased significantly early in the fiscal year because of the disruption in operations caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
although volume rebounded strongly toward the end of the first quarter  a restricted supply of creosote from europe toward the end of fiscal year kept volume from keeping pace with strong demand for creosote 
we believe that strong demand from major railroads for crossties treated with creosote will continue in the near term 
animal health pesticides segment sales revenues increased by million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  or a increase 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to our purchase in february of certain assets of the animal health pesticide business of boehringer ingelheim and the balance came from increased volume in our other animal health products 
sales revenue in agricultural chemicals decreased by  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  or a decrease  on both lower volume and prices 
sales of our animal health and agricultural products are seasonal  and occur primarily in the second half of our fiscal year 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on our sales  particularly sales of agricultural chemicals 
the end users of some of our products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season  which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and reduce our revenues and profitability 
the combined revenues from products subject to seasonal variations represented less than of our total annual revenues 
their peak selling season is during the last two quarters of the fiscal year  and revenue and profit are concentrated in these periods 
segment income loss from operations income from operations of the penta segment increased by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  or an increase of  primarily because of higher revenue 
in fiscal year  creosote segment income from operations increased by million to million from million in fiscal year  or an increase of because of creosote price increases 
animal health pesticides segment income from operations increased by  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  or an increase of 
animal health pesticides segment volume increased  particularly from products acquired from boehringer ingelheim in february the interim marketing arrangement with the seller under a transition agreement and the increased amortization of purchased animal health intangibles held down this segment s income from operations 
the transitional agreement expired at the end of july  and in fiscal year we expect that operating margins will approximate segment historical levels 
the agricultural chemicals segment had a loss of  not including the impairment charge  due to lesser volume and prices 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year and fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales revenue and gross profit fiscal year vs 
fiscal year net sales revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  an increase of 
for fiscal year  of the increase in net sales came from our penta segment 
penta volume increased significantly in fiscal year due to the penta assets acquisition from basic chemicals company late in fiscal year approximately of our increase in net sales revenue in fiscal year came from the creosote segment  principally due to creosote price increases 
approximately of the increase in net sales revenue came from the animal health segment where we experienced increased volume  most of which was because of the effect of sales of the products acquired from boehringer ingelheim in february agricultural chemical sales decreased on decreased volume and price 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year gross profit as a percent of sales increased to of sales in fiscal year as compared to of sales in fiscal year the margin improvement in fiscal year came primarily from increased volume of sales of higher margin penta products and from increased animal health sales volume on products acquired in fiscal year because other companies may include certain of the costs that we record in cost of sales in selling  general and administrative expenses  and may include certain of the costs that we record in selling  general and administrative expenses as cost of sales  our gross profit may not be comparable to that reported by other companies 
margins will continue to be impacted in fiscal year by the high costs of raw materials used to produce penta 
penta raw material costs for chlorine and phenol remained at high levels in fiscal year as compared to average prices paid over the previous five years  increasing costs by approximately million 
in fiscal year  our cost for the solvent needed to make penta solutions increased approximately over fiscal year we expect that penta raw material costs will continue at high levels throughout fiscal year  maintaining pressure on our margins 
we also expect that our creosote raw material costs will be under increased upward pressure in fiscal year and beyond  because the supply of creosote has begun to tighten 
msma product prices and volumes improved in fiscal year over the prior year  but in fiscal year  net sales revenue for msma product declined  primarily in the fourth quarter  on both lower prices and volumes 
for the first time we experienced an operating loss in the fourth quarter  and also for the first time  our operating loss for the fiscal year exceeded depreciation and amortization for the segment 
in addition  in august the epa published its preliminary decision not to re register msma and other organic arsenical herbicides  and said that unless it changed that decision after a comment period  it would seek to cancel the registrations that allow these products to be sold in the united states 
we believe that the scientific data supports the re registration of msma 
we intend to provide scientific information to the epa and defend the re registration of our msma products 
because epa s decision is not a final action  farmers  turf managers and others may continue to use msma products for all currently registered uses and crops 
the epa s preliminary decision is expected to add significantly to the cost of maintaining the registration in the united states 
as a result of the deterioration in msma market conditions at the end of fiscal year and the epa s action  we concluded that assets related to msma are impaired  and that an impairment charge of million in fiscal year is required based on diminished future expected cash flows and a shorter expected useful life 
the net value of the long lived msma assets on our balance sheet is  after the impairment charge 
the impaired assets consist of registrations and property  plant and equipment related to the production of msma products at matamoros  mexico 
in fiscal year  the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the impaired assets was  the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the impaired assets is anticipated to be approximately  in each of fiscal years  and  their expected remaining useful life 
the impairment charge in fiscal year and resulting reductions in depreciation and amortization expense are all non cash items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year net sales revenue increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  an increase of 
increased net penta sales accounted for approximately one third of the increase 
penta volume increased significantly in fiscal year due to the penta acquisitions from basic chemicals company late in fiscal year and from wood protection products in december  which together had a positive impact of approximately million on our net sales revenue 
approximately one half of our increase in net sales revenue came from increased creosote sales  principally due to increased volume  which resulted from increased demand for wood crossties from railroads 
we also benefited from the acquisition of creosote distribution assets from trenton sales 
because we completed that acquisition in june  it did not have a significant impact on our net sales until fiscal year net sales revenue from animal health pesticides and agricultural chemicals also increased in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year we experienced increased volume in animal health pesticides sales  due to improved rabon sales and the ravap product we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross profit increased from million  or of sales in fiscal year  to million  or of sales in fiscal year the margin improvement in fiscal year resulted from increased volume of sales of higher margin penta products and from creosote price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal year vs 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  an increase of million  or  excluding the impairment charge pertaining to msma assets 
in fiscal year  our selling  general and administrative expenses included million in distribution expense  as compared to million in fiscal year in january  we transitioned sales of creosote and penta from a delivered basis to an fob plant basis  thereby reducing our distribution expense 
distribution expense in the first half of fiscal year  which ended on january   was million  but fell to million in the second half of fiscal year we also experienced increased expense for amortization of penta intangibles acquired in fiscal year  and increased expense for supply chain disruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
approximately million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expense category was due to increased amortization expense 
we temporarily lost the use of our creosote terminal near new orleans due to hurricane katrina and incurred additional expense for a substitute interim terminal 
we incurred additional expense in fiscal year of approximately  over the prior fiscal year for performance stock awards to employees  shares issued to directors and  with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  fas r  we began expensing previously issued options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our product permit fees increased approximately  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the acquisition of additional animal health products registrations and our product regulatory expense 
our expenses for testing  data submission and other costs associated with our participation in product task forces increased to approximately million in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  because of our purchase of penta registrations in june and increased costs to support our msma products registrations 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  an increase of  attributable to greater penta and creosote sales volume from acquisitions 
performance based incentive compensation and the addition of j 
neal butler  our president and chief operating officer  increased executive compensation expenses relative to fiscal year by approximately  amortization of intangibles associated with our recent acquisitions contributed approximately  to selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year  and product task force expense increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  an increase of 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal year compared with  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the increases have been due to increases in term loan borrowings to complete our acquisitions in wood preserving chemicals and animal health pesticides 
gain on sale of securities we sold marketable securities for a gain of  in fiscal year income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal year  as compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year in may  the state of texas enacted a new law that substantially changed its tax system 
the law replaced the taxable capital and earned surplus components of the current franchise tax with a new tax that is based on modified gross revenue 
this new tax is referred to as the margin tax and is effective january  we have assessed the impact of the change in tax law and do not believe it will have a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash from operating activities was million in fiscal year net income  the adjustment for depreciation and amortization and the impairment charge accounted for million of cash from operations in fiscal year accounts receivable increased by  from million in fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily a result of higher sales revenue  but we also reduced the ending balance of our bad debt allowance by  inventories increased by million from million in fiscal year  an increase of  due to animal health inventory associated with the animal health products acquisition from boehringer ingelheim in february  and due to an effort to build penta inventory in advance of the hurricane season 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we used net cash to complete acquisitions in our animal health segment in fiscal year and in the penta segment in fiscal year our acquisitions totaled million in and million in fiscal year we also used approximately million in fiscal year  primarily to improve penta production capacity and operations at our matamoros  mexico and tuscaloosa  alabama facilities 
we added million in net cash from financing activities in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we sold  shares and selling shareholders sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share net of discounts and commissions 
the net proceeds from the sale were million 
in fiscal year  we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from that sale were million 
principal repayments on indebtedness were million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year to finance our acquisition of the penta business from basic chemicals company  we incurred million in seller financed indebtedness in fiscal year the first principal payment of million was paid in june we also paid cash dividends of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year working capital we have a working capital line of credit under a revolving credit facility with wachovia bank which acquired our former lender  southtrust bank 
at the end of fiscal year  we had no borrowings under that facility 
under that credit facility  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable plus a portion of our inventory 
the amount available under the facility at the end of fiscal year was million 
the revolving credit facility contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants  including a limitation that without consent our equity investments or loans cannot exceed  the revolving credit facility also requires that we satisfy the same financial covenants as our two term loans 
the revolving credit facility expires on december  we anticipate no difficulties in renewing this facility 
long term obligations our purchase of the other supplier s penta business in fiscal year was financed in part by a million promissory note payable to the seller 
the promissory note is payable in five equal annual principal installments of million plus interest at per annum 
the first installment was paid on june   and subsequent installments are payable on the same date each year thereafter until the promissory note is paid in full 
the principal balance of the promissory note was million at the end of fiscal year our purchase of the rabon animal health pesticides business in fiscal year and our acquisitions in fiscal year were financed in part by two term loans under a senior credit facility with wachovia bank 
the aggregate principal balance of the two term loans was million at the end of fiscal year one term loan is being amortized monthly over ten years but the maturity date is december  the loan carries interest at a varying rate equal to libor plus  however  in february  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with our lender which effectively fixed the interest rate at for the remainder of the term 
the principal balance outstanding on that loan was million at the end of fiscal year our second term loan was in the original principal amount of million  but it was refinanced in june to reflect an additional million advance to fund acquisitions 
the principal amount of that loan is being repaid monthly over seven years at varying installment amounts  but the maturity date is june  the second term loan carries interest at a varying rate initially equal to libor plus 
the margin over libor is dependent upon a financial leverage ratio and can vary between and 
for fiscal year  the margin over libor for this term loan is expected to be between and 
the principal balance outstanding on the loan was million at the end of fiscal year the two term loans require us to satisfy certain financial covenants  but those covenants were amended in june the amendment eliminated minimum tangible net worth and liabilities to tangible net worth requirements  and revised our required coverage ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation 
the revised requirement is that our coverage ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation be not greater than to as of july  and october   and not greater than to as of january  and at all times thereafter 
we believe that our working capital  the seller financed indebtedness  our term loans and revolving credit facility and the net proceeds of our june stock offering adequately provide for our anticipated need for liquidity and capital resources through fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were approximately million  of which million was incurred to expand our penta production capacity in matamoros  mexico and in tuscaloosa  alabama 
in fiscal year  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were approximately  of which  was recovered through an insurance policy claim 
our capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  excluding testing  data submission and other costs associated with our product task force participation  were approximately  in fiscal year   in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year we expensed approximately million for testing  data submission and other costs associated with our participation in product task forces in fiscal year  and approximately  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increasing expense was due to increased activity in the product reauthorization process being conducted by the epa and the acquisition of additional product registrations 
we believe that total testing  data submission and other costs will be approximately million in fiscal year since environmental laws have traditionally become increasingly stringent  costs and expenses relating to environmental control and compliance may increase in the future 
while we do not believe that the incremental cost of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  we cannot assure that costs of compliance will not exceed current estimates 
contractual obligations our obligations to make future payments under contracts as of july  are summarized in the following table in thousands 
total long term debt operating leases other long term liabilities purchase obligations estimated interest payments on debt estimated payments receipts under interest rate swap post retirement benefit obligations are included 
estimated payments are based on forecast interest rates as of september outlook for fiscal year demand for utility poles treated with penta and railroad ties treated with creosote was strong in fiscal year  favorably impacting our sales for our wood treating chemicals 
we expect that strong demand will continue through fiscal year average prices for the chlorine and phenol we need to produce penta eased in recent months 
although those raw materials are still significantly above average prices for the previous five years  we expect prices may ease further on some raw materials in fiscal year the supply of creosote tightened in fiscal year creosote is a byproduct of the coal tar distillation process  and in some parts of the world coal tar distillate is now being used for fuel because of high energy prices 
coal tar distillate is also sold into the carbon black market 
consequently  creosote supply is expected to continue being tight in fiscal year  and the average price we pay for our supply is expected to be higher 
we will attempt to pass through the increasing cost of creosote to our customers  although no assurance can be given that we will be completely successful in that effort 
we have successfully integrated the animal health insecticide business that we purchased in february we continue to believe that the newly purchased business will generate over million in sales in fiscal year  and be significantly accretive to earnings 
we expect  however  that our agricultural chemicals segment will not materially affect operating income in fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities 
new accounting standards in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
permits hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation to irrevocably be accounted for at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of income 
the fair value election may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis 
sfas no 
also eliminates a restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a qualifying special purpose entity may hold 
sfas no 
is effective for those financial instruments acquired or issued after september  at adoption  any difference between the total carrying amount of the individual components of the existing bifurcated hybrid financial instrument and the fair value of the combined hybrid financial instrument will be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
we do not expect the new standard to have any material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
the standard permits an entity to subsequently measure each class of servicing assets or servicing liabilities at fair value and report changes in fair value in the statement of income in the period in which the changes occur 
sfas no 
is effective for the company as of december  we do not expect the new standard to have any material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for the company for financial statements issued subsequent to november  we do not expect the new standard to have any material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal year management is currently evaluating the requirements of fin no 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
we do not expect that the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting principles that we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following revenue recognition 
in general  we recognize revenue of our chemical products sold in the open market when risk of loss and title to the products transfers to our customers  which usually occurs at the time a shipment is made 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes inbound freight charges  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs and internal transfer costs 
in the case of products we manufacture  direct and indirect manufacturing costs and associated plant administrative expenses are included as well as laid in cost of raw materials consumed in the manufacturing process 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide an allowance for accounts receivable we believe we may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance 
accounts receivable that are written off our books decrease the allowance 
the amount of bad debt expense recorded each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period are determined using a customer by customer analyses of our accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of our future bad debt exposure 
write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically been insignificant 
inventories 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods that we hold for sale in the ordinary course of business 
we use the first in  first out method to value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
management believes we have not incurred impairments in the carrying value of our inventories 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the initial recording of goodwill and other intangibles requires estimation of the fair value of assets and liabilities using fair value measurements  which include quoted market price  present value techniques estimate of future cash flows  and other valuation techniques 
additionally  fasb statement no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets to be reviewed for possible impairment on an annual basis  or if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
determining fair value and implied fair value is subjective and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the recording of intangible assets  whether or not an impairment loss is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment loss 
our estimates of fair value are primarily determined using present value techniques of projected future cash flows 
this approach uses significant assumptions such as multi year sales projections with associated expenses 
we have performed impairment analyses on our goodwill and intangible assets of indefinite life  which indicated as of july  an impairment loss was not appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review periodically the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated for potential impairment on a product line basis 
we have concluded on the basis of our evaluation that our long lived assets are not impaired  except for certain assets related to our msma products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements we are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect us and to take advantage of the safe harbor protection for forward looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords 
from time to time  our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company 
these forward looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of our operations 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated by reference in this report that address activities  events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future  including such things as future capital expenditures  business strategy  competitive strengths  goals  growth of our business and operations  plans and references to future successes may be considered forward looking statements 
also  when we use words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  intend  plan  project  forecast  may  should  budget  goal  expect  probably or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
many risks and uncertainties may impact the matters addressed in these forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements speak only as of the date made and we will not update forward looking statements unless the securities laws require us to do so 
some of the key factors which could cause our future financial results and performance to vary from those expected include the loss of primary customers  our ability to implement productivity improvements  cost reduction initiatives or facilities expansions  market developments affecting  and other changes in  the demand for our products and the introduction of new competing products  availability or increases in the price of our primary raw materials or active ingredients  the timing of planned capital expenditures  our ability to identify  develop or acquire  and market additional product lines and businesses necessary to implement our business strategy and our ability to finance such acquisitions and development  the condition of the capital markets generally  which will be affected by interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions  cost and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims  including environmental liabilities which may not be covered by indemnity or insurance  the ability to obtain registration and re registration of our products under applicable law  the political and economic climate in the foreign or domestic jurisdictions in which we conduct business  and other united states or foreign regulatory or legislative developments which affect the demand for our products generally or increase the environmental compliance cost for our products or impose liabilities on the manufacturers and distributors of such products 
the information contained in this report  including the information set forth under the heading risk factors  identifies additional factors that could cause our results or performance to differ materially from those we express in our forward looking statements 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward looking statements are reasonable  any of these assumptions and  therefore  the forward looking statements based on these assumptions  could themselves prove to be inaccurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements which are included in this report and the exhibits and other documents incorporated herein by reference  our inclusion of this information is not a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not utilize derivative financial instruments or hedging transactions to manage that risk  however  we did enter into an interest rate swap transaction in february that effectively fixed the interest rate on one of our term loans at for the remainder of the loan s term 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not affect our earnings or cash flow over the life of the term loan because the interest rate swap serves to fix the interest rate at 
should the financial market s expectations for interest rates in the future increase  then the value of the swap  recorded as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets  would increase 
conversely  a drop in the financial market s expectations for future interest rates would cause a drop in the value of that recorded asset 
it is possible that the future expectations for interest rates could decline enough to cause the swap to be recorded no longer as an asset  but as a liability  until the swap expires in december at july  the market value of the swap was an asset of
