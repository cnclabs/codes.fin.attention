these statements include  but are not limited to  statements about anticipated market conditions  expected growth rates of revenues and expenses  planned asset dispositions  disposition pricing  planned acquisitions and developments  property financings  expected interest rates and planned capital expenditures 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included in this report on form k will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  in that they require the most subjective judgments  form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  and fair value of derivative financial instruments 
revenue recognition the company leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less 
rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned 
the company records all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with statement no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years for land improvements and buildings  years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment  and to years for computers and software  all of which are subjective determinations 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements  renovations  and replacements are capitalized 
the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company s standards are capitalized as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the company s fiscal fourth quarter  or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance  market conditions  and legal factors 
in accordance with statement  long lived assets  such as real estate assets  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
in the apartment industry  the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate 
the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property s market or submarket 
second  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of derivative financial instruments the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps and caps  during the normal course of business to manage  or hedge  the interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 
the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under statement no 
as amended requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective 
while the company s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations  the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated 
the company performs ineffectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter  through the term of the hedging instruments 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity

this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit definition 
disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s staff policy statement relating to eitf topic d concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock  the company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its ffo calculation 
the company s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting  vinyl flooring  and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties 
during the stabilization period for acquisition properties  these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties  and  thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding the company s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets 
the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets  whose value does not diminish predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits

trends property performance over the past four years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the company s markets  but has begun to show signs of improvement 
the company believes that demand by apartment renters is most impacted by household formation  which is driven by job formation 
job formation has been quite weak in many of the company s markets  and most noticeably in the larger metro areas  such as atlanta  houston and dallas 
some of the smaller and mid size markets in which the company operates  such as jackson  mississippi  jacksonville  florida  and columbus  georgia have been less impacted 
on the supply side  low interest rates encouraged over building of apartments  especially in the larger metropolitan areas 
delivery of new apartment units during this period of weakened apartment demand increased competition  reducing apartment occupancy levels  especially in the larger markets 
in addition  single family homes  which are direct competition for apartments  became even more affordable  and home ownership continued to climb in the company s markets 
in  the company began to see a turn in many of its markets  particularly in florida and georgia  where there are some signs of improving demand coupled with a slight slow down in supply 
the company s large tier markets  which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn  are beginning to show signs of absorbing the oversupply of new apartments and returning to historical occupancy and pricing levels  while the company s smaller tier and mid sized markets are benefiting from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth 
the policies of the federal reserve  which has raised short term interest rates by basis points in a short span of time  also seem to be having some early impact on the supply of new apartments 
development costs of apartments and of single family homes also appear to be rising  as are mortgage interest rates  with the likelihood that this may slightly alleviate this competition 
the company believes that the impact of higher demand from apartment renters  a reduced rate of increase in supply  and reduced competition from single family homes will contribute to better operating results in while rising interest rates will also increase the company s cost of borrowing  the company has mitigated part of the impact of this by putting in place million of forward swap  such that the interest rate on approximately of its debt has been fixed  swapped  forward swapped  or capped  compared to at the end of liquidity and capital resources net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately  to  for compared to  for mainly related to the growth of the company through acquisitions and improved operating results in net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately  to  for compared to  for mainly related to the growth of the company through the bremaac buyout and the acquisitions and acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately  from  in to  in net cash used in investing activities in was approximately  a total of approximately  was invested in to acquire properties  this compares to approximately  in  and  in capital improvements to existing real estate assets during  and totaled approximately   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately  to  in from  in and  in cash provided from credit lines and notes payable decreased approximately  from approximately  in to  in cash provided from credit lines and notes payable was approximately  in principal payments on notes payable dropped to approximately  in from  in and  in as the company had fewer refinancings in proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in to approximately  mainly related to the company s use of its drspp 
proceeds from issuances of common shares and units decreased approximately  from to as the company sold  shares of common stock to certain advisory clients of cohen steers capital management  inc and to scudder rreef real estate fund ii  inc in to partially fund the bremaac buyout and acquisitions 
the weighted average interest rate at december   for the billion of debt outstanding was compared to on billion of debt outstanding at december  the company utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance its activities 
borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and secured credit facilities 
the company utilizes fixed rate borrowings  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage its current and future interest rate risk 
more details on the company s borrowings can be found in the schedule on page at december   the company had secured credit facilities relationships with prudential mortgage capital which are credit enhanced by the federal national mortgage association fnma  fnma  federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  and a group of banks led by amsouth bank 
together  these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of billion at december   with an availability to borrow of billion 
at december   the company had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of million 
approximately of the company s outstanding obligations at december   were borrowed through facilities with or credit enhanced by fnma the fnma facilities 
the fnma facilities have a combined line limit of million  million of which was available to borrow at december  various traunches of the facilities mature from through the fnma facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security dmbs rate on the date of renewal  which has typically approximated three month libor less an average spread of over the life of the fnma facilities  plus a credit enhancement fee of to 
each of the company s secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage  and are subject to periodic re evaluation of collateral 
if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing  the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
in the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced 
moreover  if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility  after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default  accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and or foreclose on properties securing such facilities 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company

the  in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the acquisition of the lighthouse court apartments 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations  annual refurbishment of its properties  and incremental investment in new apartment properties 
the company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities  and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma  which provides credit enhancement for approximately million of the company s debt 
the interest rate market for fnma dmbs  which in the company s experience is highly correlated with three month libor interest rates  is also an important component of the company s liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness 
in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient  or the credit of fnma becomes impaired  the company would seek alternative sources of debt financing 
for the year ended december   the company s net cash provided by operating activities exceeded improvements to existing real estate assets  distributions to unitholders  and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately million 
this compares to shortfalls for the years ended december   and  of approximately million and million  respectively 
while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates  from time to time the company may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary 
any significant deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to reduce the distribution rate
