change in same restaurant guest visits is not available for ninety nine prior to as the o charley s methodology of counting guest visits was adopted subsequent to the completion of the acquisition and we are unable to recast visits using that same methodology 

table of contents the average check per guest is computed using all restaurants open at the end of the year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues during  total revenues increased million  or  to million from million in in  we averaged restaurants in operation per quarter as compared to restaurants in operation per quarter in o charley s restaurant sales increased million  or  to million during  as a result of the net addition of four new restaurants during same restaurant sales were flat for the year 
ninety nine restaurant sales increased million  or  to million during the year over year sales increase was primarily related to a same restaurant sales increase of and the addition of ten new restaurants during the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a increase in guest counts offset by a decrease in check average of 
stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or  to million during  as a result of same restaurant sales increases of 
the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a improvement in the average check and a increase in guest counts 
cost of food and beverage while our cost of food and beverage in was flat with as a percentage of sales it was higher than we anticipated  due in part to our traffic building promotions  higher distribution costs and higher costs associated with the opening of the bellingham distribution center 
reductions in poultry costs were offset by increases in produce costs resulting from weather related crop damage  and increased seafood costs 
we continue to benefit from our practice of buying ahead on volatile commodities to take advantage of predictable seasonal price fluctuations 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits increased basis points as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the same prior year period 
higher average wage and benefit rates and declines in productivity contributed to the increase as well as an increase in the hourly health care plans in as compared to restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased basis points during increases in packaging costs  higher energy costs and repairs and maintenance costs resulted in the year over year increase 
the higher packaging costs were the result of an increase in packaging material costs combined with increases in our to go sales 
the increase in energy costs were primarily associated with natural gas price increases 
advertising expenses during  our advertising costs decreased million to million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues  in the decrease in advertising expenditures as a percentage of total revenues is primarily due to the use of the same promotional calendar on a year over year basis  enabling us to utilize some print and television media which were produced in the prior years 

table of contents general and administrative expenses during  our general and administrative costs increased million to million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues  in general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to primarily because of million in severance and consulting expenses associated with the financial system conversion project 
we also incurred approximately million in severance and recruiting expenses in associated with previously announced management changes 
in  we incurred severance and related costs of approximately million associated with the organizational changes that were implemented during the third and fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization during  our depreciation and amortization costs increased million to million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues  in the increase is primarily attributable to additions of long lived assets of million during asset impairment and disposals during  we recorded impairment and disposal charges of million 
the impairment and disposal charges consisted of a million charge related to the planned closure of six under performing o charley s restaurants  million for two o charley s restaurants that remain open  million for losses relating to the o charley s store in biloxi  mississippi that was destroyed by hurricane katrina  and a million impairment charge to write down the value of a corporate aircraft  which we intend to sell  to reflect the difference between its current book value and the estimated net sale proceeds 
these charges also include net losses of approximately million on asset sales 
we expect that the sale of the aircraft will reduce future annual general and administrative expenses by approximately million per year 
pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs increased million to million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues  in the increase is due to timing of restaurant openings and the increased costs incurred for opening the first stoney river restaurant since we estimate average pre opening costs of approximately  for each new o charley s restaurant  approximately  for each new stoney river restaurant and approximately  for each new ninety nine restaurant 
interest expense during  our interest costs increased million to million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues  in the increase is due to higher short term interest rates on our variable rate debt 
interest expense during reflects million of senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of  approximately million weighted average debt outstanding on our million revolving credit facility at one month libor plus  and other debt including capitalized lease obligations and prepaid financing costs 
approximately million of the senior subordinated notes have been effectively converted through interest rate swap agreements into a variable interest rate obligation based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus 
income taxes during  our income tax expense decreased million to million  or of total revenues  compared with million  or of total revenues  in our effective tax rate of in dropped to in this decrease was primarily attributable to higher tax credits and lower pre tax earnings 

table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues during  total revenues increased million  or  to million from million in total revenues for included weeks of sales from the operations of ninety nine restaurants in the first fiscal quarter of compared to weeks of ninety nine results in the first fiscal quarter of we acquired ninety nine on january  o charley s restaurant sales increased million  or  to million during as a result of same restaurant sales increases of and the addition of restaurants during the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a increase in the number of guest visits partially offset by a decrease in our average check 
ninety nine restaurant sales increased million  or  during the year over year sales increase was primarily related to same restaurant sales increases of in and the addition of new restaurants during the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a check average increase partially offset by a decline in guest visits 
stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or  during due primarily to same restaurant sales increases of 
the same restaurant sales increase was comprised of a improvement in the average check coupled with a increase in guest counts 
cost of food and beverage during  we continued to experience higher food costs  a trend that began during the second quarter of we estimate that food cost inflation  as compared to the same prior year period  was approximately in  consisting primarily of higher poultry  pork and cheese costs 
commodity cost increases resulted in an increase in the cost of food and beverage of of restaurant sales compared to fiscal we estimate that commodity cost inflation adversely affected our diluted earnings per share by approximately in as compared to the prior year 
during and  poultry represented  on average  approximately to of our cost of food and beverage 
during  our price of purchasing poultry was approximately higher compared to the prior year 
historically  we have not entered into contracts to fix poultry prices and  accordingly  we were subject to weekly market price fluctuations during fiscal and payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits increased basis points as a percentage of restaurant sales compared to the same prior year period 
higher restaurant level bonus expense  payroll taxes and worker s compensation expenses were partially offset by lower hourly health insurance costs 
the higher restaurant level bonus expenses  and the resulting increase in payroll taxes  were related to the improving sales trends and margins at our o charley s restaurants 
the increase in worker s compensation expenses related to more favorable cost trends late in the lower hourly insurance costs were related to better than expected claims experience compared to restaurant operating costs restaurant operating costs during decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales as compared to primarily due to decreased supervisory expenses partially offset by increased rent expense from sale and leaseback transactions 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we completed sale and leaseback transactions pursuant to which we sold o charley s restaurant properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the leases that we have entered into in connection with the million sale and leaseback transactions will require us to expense on a straight line basis approximately million annually  including the amortization of the million deferred gain over the year lease term 

table of contents the reduction in supervisory expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to a reduction in the number of operational supervisory positions during the first quarter of advertising expenses during  advertising expenditures increased to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  declined to from in the prior year 
the decrease in advertising expenditures as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to economies of scale by having a higher concentration of restaurants in existing markets 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  was due primarily to increased incentive compensation expense 
during  we shifted the emphasis of our equity based compensation plans from stock options to restricted stock 
during  the expense associated with these equity based compensation plans reduced earnings by per diluted share compared to per diluted share during fiscal depreciation and amortization during  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment decreased as a percentage of total revenues 
the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately million of depreciation that was eliminated as a result of the sale and leaseback transactions completed during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of pre opening costs during  pre opening costs declined as a percentage of total revenues due primarily to fewer restaurant openings compared to the same prior year period 
interest expense interest expense decreased during compared to the prior year as a result of the reduction of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility with million of aggregate gross proceeds from the sale and leaseback of o charley s restaurant properties 
interest expense during reflected million of senior subordinated notes at a fixed rate of  approximately million outstanding on our million bank revolver accruing interest at one month libor plus  and other debt including capitalized lease obligations and prepaid financing costs that accounted for approximately million in interest expense during approximately million of the senior subordinated notes have been effectively converted through interest rate swap agreements into a variable interest rate obligation using the six month libor rate in arrears plus income taxes our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in the reduction resulted primarily from an increase in the net benefit from the fica tip and other credits from million in to million in 
table of contents outlook our management was disappointed with our financial performance in  and is taking steps that we believe will improve performance in and beyond 
management expects to focus our efforts in in the following areas strengthen the organization with a new core of talent and build a winning team 
during the first quarter of  we hired a new president for the o charley s concept 
in the third quarter of  we hired a new chief human resources officer and real estate development activities were consolidated 
our chief financial officer  who joined our company at the beginning of  was given additional responsibilities for information systems and strategic planning 
we formed a team within the o charley s concept which will focus on underperforming restaurants  and on new retrofit restaurant design 
we are also currently searching for a senior supply chain executive to lead our commissaries  and consider all alternatives for our commissary operations 
enhance guest satisfaction and intent to return by instilling a passion to serve at all levels of the organization 
in  we adopted a vision statement a passion to serve 
this statement describes our commitment to our guests  each other  our stakeholders and our communities 
our vision is to be the best of class in food and service in our segments of the restaurant industry 
we are making operational changes to improve the guest experience from the moment they walk through the door  until the moment they leave as a satisfied guest 
we are improving the screening  training  and development of team members at all levels of the organization  focusing first on those who come in contact with our guests 
we are measuring guest satisfaction and rewarding our restaurant managers on the achievement of specific targets 
improve the execution of product and labor cost management 
in april  we completed the roll out of our theoretical food cost system to our restaurants 
this system allows us to track and monitor food and prep waste inefficiencies at the restaurants by calculating and comparing theoretical food cost to actual food cost 
in addition  we are addressing the labor management issues with a back to basics approach and intend to implement a new labor scheduling system that we believe will result in increased productivity 
focus the organization on our commitment to greater profitability  with incentives for success and consequences for failing to meet our targets 
we are introducing an incentive compensation plan more closely tied to financial performance and guest satisfaction 
if store level targets are not met  we will not compensate our restaurant managers with store level bonuses 
we have reduced new restaurant development in in order to focus on improving profitability  productivity and guest experience for all of our concepts 
increase same restaurant sales through new product offerings  new marketing  and a more analytical approach to menu pricing 
we believe that we will be able to drive sales with a new marketing campaign in along with new products and menus that will be introduced at o charley s and ninety nine 
in addition  we believe that there are significant opportunities to increase check average at both o charley s and ninety nine 
those pricing decisions will be based upon a more analytical approach which analyzes the price sensitivity of demand of each menu item 
we expect this approach to result in a greater pass through of price increases to average check 
we expect to report net earnings per diluted share of between and for the week period ending april   and net earnings per diluted share of between and for the fiscal year ending december  the fiscal year is a week year 
our guidance for the full year reflects an estimated positive earnings impact from the rd week of between and per diluted share 
projected results for the full year are based upon anticipated same restaurant sales increases of between and for the o charley s and ninety nine concepts  with same restaurant sales increases expected to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half 
we expect improvement in our income from operations as a percentage of sales during the operating margin for the first quarter of is expected to be below the prior year quarter  while the operating margin for subsequent quarters is expected to show improvement compared with the prior year quarters 
we project an effective tax rate of approximately for the full fiscal year  compared with 
table of contents in  and interest expense of between million and million for the year  compared with million in the fiscal year 
our guidance does not reflect any impact for restructuring or other charges relating to decisions that we may make during fiscal as part of our turnaround efforts 
we expect to open between three and five company owned o charley s restaurants  between seven and ten ninety nine restaurants  and two or three stoney river restaurants in fiscal we expect capital expenditures in to be in the range of million to million dollars 
we continue to follow our practice of buying ahead of volatile commodities to take advantage of predictable seasonal fluctuations 
as of december   we have locked in our pricing for approximately of our estimated beef requirements and approximately of our estimated requirements for poultry and pork 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  capital leases and sales of common stock 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases and have substantial operating lease obligations 
like many restaurant companies  our working capital has historically had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to the fact that most of our sales are received as cash or credit card charges  and we have reinvested our cash in new restaurant development 
we do not believe this indicates a lack of liquidity 
we opened o charley s and ten ninety nine restaurants during unlike most restaurant companies  we have a vertically integrated supply chain in which our commissary provides distribution services to all restaurants and manufactures certain items 
as we continue to increase the amount of investment we are making in food inventory in our commissary  we expect to see a reduction in the negative working capital 
the bank credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility with a maximum principal amount of million 
at december   the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was million  which excludes approximately million in letters of credit which reduces the capacity on the credit facility 
the facility has a four year term maturing in  and bears interest  at our option  at either libor plus a specified margin ranging from to based on certain financial ratios or the base rate  which is the higher of the lender s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  plus a specified margin from to based on certain financial ratios 
as of the end of  our libor loans were priced using a margin of 
the credit facility imposes restrictions on us with respect to the incurrence of additional indebtedness  sales of assets  mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures  investments  repurchases of stock and the payment of dividends 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to comply with certain specified financial covenants  including covenants and ratios relating to our senior secured leverage  maximum adjusted leverage  minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum asset coverage and maximum capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with such covenants at december  the credit facility contains certain events of default  including an event of default resulting from certain changes in control 
all amounts owing under the facility are secured by of our equity interests in each of our existing subsidiaries and substantially all of our subsidiaries tangible and intangible assets  other than real property acquired after the date of the credit facility and equipment 
the lenders may  under certain circumstances  also require that we pledge such real estate and equipment as collateral 
from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions 
these swap agreements may effectively convert some of our obligations that bear interest at variable rates into fixed rate obligations and may effectively convert some of our obligations that bear interest at fixed rates into variable rate obligations 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  which effectively fixed the interest rate on million of our outstanding variable rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the corresponding floating rates of interest received on those notional amounts are based on one month libor rates and are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our credit facility 
the swap agreements relating to the million of our indebtedness expired in january and were accounted for as cash flow hedges at 
table of contents december  during the first quarter of  we entered into additional interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively convert a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps was million and is based on the six month libor rate in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on our senior subordinated notes due and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
these swap agreements expire in november our weighted average interest rate for the years ended december  and december  was and  respectively 
in october  we announced an authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
any repurchases will be made from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion 
to date  we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock under this authorization 
any repurchases will be funded by cash provided by operations or proceeds from short term borrowings under our credit facility 
in  net cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  new equipment and improvements at our commissary  and technological improvements at our restaurant support center 
for the year ended december   new equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations was million 
new restaurant equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations was million for capital expenditures for the years ended december  and december   excluding new restaurant equipment financed through capitalized lease obligations  were as follows december  december  in thousands new restaurant capital expenditures other capital expenditures total capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures in to be between million and million 
as part of our focus on improving results in our existing restaurants  we plan to develop and open fewer restaurants in than we opened in we expect to open between three and five new company owned o charley s restaurants  between seven and ten new ninety nine restaurants  and two or three new stoney river restaurants in the following tables set forth our capital structure and certain financial ratios and financial data at and for the fiscal years ended december  and december  at december  at december  in thousands revolving credit facility secured mortgage note payable ge capital financing arrangement capitalized lease obligations total senior debt senior subordinated notes total debt shareholders equity total capitalization adjusted total debt adjusted total capitalization

we have historically produced insufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital and capital expenditures and  accordingly  our ability to meet our anticipated capital needs is dependent on our ability to continue to access external financing  particularly borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
any acquisitions  joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing 
there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to us or that any such financing would not negatively impact our earnings

these purchase obligations are primarily fixed volume  fixed price food and beverage contracts 
in situations where the price is based on market prices  we use the existing market prices at december  to determine the amount of the obligation 
of the total unconditional purchase obligations shown  million are based on variable pricing 
this pertains to our revolving line of credit of which million is included in long term debt shown above 
in addition  we have million in letters of credit outstanding which reduces our remaining borrowing capacity under this line of credit to million 
this pertains to the financing arrangement with ge capital franchise finance corporation and represents our maximum obligation 
as of december   there were million of loans outstanding under this financing arrangement 
joint ventures and franchise arrangements in connection with our franchising initiative  we may from time to time enter into joint venture arrangements to develop and operate o charley s restaurants 
for any franchisee in which we have an ownership interest  we may make loans to the joint venture entity and or guarantee certain of its debt and obligations 
on november   we entered into a program agreement with ge capital franchise finance corporation 
under the terms of the program agreement  ge capital franchise finance corporation will provide financing to certain qualified franchisees of our o charley s restaurants typically those in which we have an ownership interest 
the program is for a maximum aggregate amount of  such financing may be used to fund the acquisition  construction and installation of the land  building and equipment for new o charley s restaurants opened by such franchisees or to fund a franchisee s acquisition from us of the land  building and equipment for existing o charley s restaurants 
under the program  financing will be provided in the maximum amount of million per location or of the total acquisition and construction costs relating to each restaurant  whichever is less 
in consideration of the lender s agreement to make financing available under the program to certain of our franchisees  we have agreed  subject to limitations  to guarantee payment to the lender of any ultimate net losses 
table of contents it may suffer in connection with loans under the program 
our maximum liability under such ultimate net loss guarantee is equal to the lesser of of the sum of the original funded principal balances of all loans under the program and million 
in addition to the ultimate net loss guarantee  we have agreed to purchase any such loans that have been declared in default by the lender if the sum of the original funded principal balances of all loans under the program is less than million 
subject to certain exceptions  our guarantee of loans under the program shall remain in effect for as long as the loans are outstanding 
to date  we have invested in two joint ventures for the development of o charley s restaurants 
on august   we invested in a joint venture for the development of ten o charley s restaurants in certain markets in southern louisiana and beaumont  texas 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement for the louisiana joint venture  ownership of the joint venture entity is shared equally between us and our joint venture partner 
the joint venture entity is managed by a board of managers composed of two individuals designated by the joint venture partner and two individuals designated by us 
the joint venture partner was required to make capital contributions in the aggregate amount of  to the joint venture entity and we agreed to make initial loans to the joint venture entity in the maximum principal amount of  the loans are secured by substantially all of the assets of the joint venture entity and are partially guaranteed by the joint venture partner 
in order to assist this first joint venture jfc enterprises  llc to open its restaurants  we decided to make additional loans to the joint venture  and as of december   we had advanced a total of million to the joint venture 
in addition  the joint venture has been given access to a million note through the above mentioned ge capital financing arrangement 
these loans funded most of the investment in the building and equipment  and the start up and operating losses incurred in the joint venture s restaurants 
although we are not obligated to do so  we are likely to fund future operating losses 
our second joint venture wi tenn restaurants  llc is in the process of developing its first restaurant in wisconsin 
under fin r  both joint ventures are variable interest entities  as we do not anticipate them having sufficient equity to fund their operations 
since we bear a disproportionate share of the financial risk associated with the joint ventures  we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the joint ventures  and in accordance with fin r  we consolidate the joint ventures in our consolidated financial statements 
on march   we entered into a development agreement with four star restaurant group  llc and michael r 
johnson

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience  outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting equity based compensation property and equipment goodwill and trademarks impairment of long lived assets tax provision and related financial statement items lease accounting on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain accounting principles relating to three aspects of lease accounting the period of time used for the amortization of leasehold improvements  the recognition of rent expense when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period of free or reduced rents commonly referred to as a rent holiday  and accounting for landlord improvement incentives to tenants 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb concludes in this fsp that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be expensed 
our policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
the lease term  for purposes of straight line rent calculations and the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated  is the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leased property or the base lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 

table of contents equity based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this standard requires expensing of stock options and other share based payments beginning in  and supersedes fasb s earlier rule the original sfas that had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only 
we have evaluated the impact of this new standard on our earnings and currently expect that the impact on fiscal earnings of adopting this new standard in will be per diluted share 
the per diluted share impact consists of per diluted share for expensing of stock options and per diluted share for expensing of the discount given to employees in our employee stock purchase plan 
furthermore  during our evaluation of this new standard on our financial statements  management made a decision that was later approved by the board of directors to accelerate the vesting of certain unvested out of the money stock options previously awarded under our employee stock plan and stock incentive plan 
the acceleration of these stock options was done to minimize future compensation expense under sfas no 
revised 
as a result of the acceleration   stock options with a range of exercise prices between and per share  of which approximately are held by named executive officers and one director  became exercisable on november  aside from the acceleration of the vesting date  the terms and conditions of the stock option agreements governing the underlying stock options remain unchanged 
the accelerated options represent approximately of the total of all outstanding options to purchase our common stock 
as a result of the acceleration  we expect to reduce the pretax stock option expense we otherwise would be required to record in connection with the accelerated options by approximately million over the original option vesting period  including million in our fiscal year 
in addition to our stock option plans  we grant restricted stock and restricted stock units as part of our equity based compensation arrangements 
many of these restricted stock plans have performance based vesting features  where the number of shares that vest each year depends upon our achievement of certain financial targets 
in some plans  the shares that do not vest in any year are forfeited  while in other plans  the shares that do not vest in any year are available to vest in future years depending upon our cumulative achievement of multi year financial targets 
the accounting for these compensation arrangements is complicated and requires significant judgment on the part of management related to the ultimate number of shares that will vest  as well as overall impact of both on the basic and diluted weighted average share calculation 
the performance based awards require variable accounting under apb no 
and fasb financial interpretation fin we believe that our accounting policy for equity based compensation provides for a reasonable and systematic means of recognizing the expense over the period of time that we derive the benefits of the team member s service 
during  the expense associated with our equity based compensation plans reduced earnings by approximately per diluted share 
we anticipate the reduction of earnings in associated with the expense of equity based awards to be to per diluted share 
property and equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until after the passage of 
table of contents time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a restaurant operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
goodwill and trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
at december   we have million in goodwill and million in indefinite life intangible assets shown on our consolidated balance sheets related to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub 
the determination of the estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to successfully integrate the ninety nine concept and to maintain the financial performance that this concept has experienced over its recent history 
we have relied on the judgments of outside valuation experts in evaluating the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets to the extent that the comparative information contained in our report is appropriate information to use in assessing whether these assets are impaired 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we completed a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including million related to trademarks  with the remaining amount of million being allocated to goodwill 
we selected the first day of each new fiscal year as the date on which we will test the goodwill and trademarks for impairment 
we completed a valuation of the goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
as of december   the first day of fiscal and our valuation showed that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
 requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a restaurant operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the restaurant efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  which is the level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 

table of contents we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in earnings on a timely basis 
during  we took an impairment charge of million for eight o charley s restaurants and a corporate aircraft 
six of those restaurants were closed in the fourth quarter and two of those restaurants remain open as of december  tax provision and related financial statement items we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on employee tip income  work opportunity and welfare to work credits  as well as estimates related to certain depreciation and capitalization policies 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
we file our income tax returns many months after our year end 
these returns are subject to audit by various federal  state and local governments several years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we then must assess the likelihood of successful legal proceedings or reach a settlement  either of which could result in material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes historical  current and future financial positions of the company 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  in accordance with sfas r  we will recognize compensation expense in our financial statements based on the fair value of all share based payments to employees team members beginning in the first quarter of we believe that the estimated impact in fiscal will be approximately per diluted share 
the per diluted share impact consists of per diluted share for expensing of stock options and per diluted share for expensing of the discount given to employees in our employee stock purchase plan 
in march  fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
the fasb issued fin to address diverse accounting practices that developed with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event 
for example  some entities recognize the fair value of the obligation prior to the retirement of the asset with the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement incorporated into the fair value of the liability 
other entities recognize the fair value of the obligation only when it is probable the asset will be retired as of a specified date using a specified method or when the asset is actually retired 
fin concludes that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
originally  the fasb proposed guidance in fasb staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  to legislative requirements on property owners to remove and dispose of asbestos or asbestos containing materials  but the fasb ultimately concluded there were additional issues that required the fasb s attention 
accordingly  the fasb withdrew the proposed fsp and issued an exposure draft  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which is the basis for fin 
table of contents as of december   we have adopted fin and the impact resulted in a charge to earnings of approximately  which we recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of income tax of approximately  in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued in exchange for employee services under fasb statement no 
r 
in this fsp  the fasb decided to defer the requirements in fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  that make a freestanding financial instrument subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other gaap when the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee 
the guidance in this fsp should be applied upon initial adoption of sfas r 
as discussed above  we will begin accounting for compensation expense in accordance with sfas r in the first quarter of in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb concludes in this fsp that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be expensed 
fasb technical bulletin ftb no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases  requires that rental costs associated with operating leases be allocated on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and ftb  accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases  starting with the beginning of the lease term 
the fasb believes there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during the construction period and the right to use that asset after the construction period 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements herein  we already apply this accounting guidance 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land  construction costs  and fuel energy costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our team members are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly team members 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our operating costs 
we also believe that increased fuel costs over the past months have had a negative impact on consumer behavior and have increased the cost of operating our commissary 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and 
table of contents variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our revolving credit facility 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving credit facility 
at december  and december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converted a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to our million senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
the total notional amount of these swaps is million and is based on six month libor rates in arrears plus a specified margin  the average of which is 
the terms and conditions of these swaps mirror the interest terms and conditions on the notes 
these swap agreements expire in november also at december  and december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converted a portion of the variable rate revolving line of credit into a fixed rate obligation 
the notional amount of these swaps was million and was based on one month libor plus a specified margin ranging from to 
the interest terms of these swaps mirrored the interest terms on the debt 
these swap agreements expired in january
