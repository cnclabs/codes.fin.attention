item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we develop  manufacture and market products for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques 
embolotherapy is the therapeutic introduction of various substances into the circulation to occlude blood vessels  either to arrest or prevent hemorrhaging or to devitalize a structure or organ by occluding its blood supply 
our core technologies consist of patented bioengineered polymers  which are chemical compounds that we create through the application to medical science of engineering principles and manufacturing methods 
these core technologies are used to produce miniature spherical beads with unique properties for a variety of applications 
typically  a procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist who injects embosphere microspheres through a catheter into the blood vessels that feed these target areas 
by selectively blocking the target tissue s blood supply  the deprived tissue will either become destroyed or devitalized  designed to result in therapeutic benefit 
in  we generated revenues primarily from product sales of our embosphere microspheres in north america and the european union 
we also generated revenues from product sales in other geographic territories  including the middle east  africa  south america  and asia 
product revenues also include the sale of accessory embolotherapy devices such as our embocath infusion catheter and our segway guidewire  as well as our other non embolotherapy products  including barium delivery kits  and other ancillary medical devices sold exclusively in europe 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues in the united states and the european union from the sale of embosphere microspheres for use in the treatment of uterine fibroids using ufe 
our principal focus is on growing our embosphere microsphere and accessory embolotherapy device business worldwide  specifically for the ufe procedure  which we believe will be a key driver to our success 
our marketing strategy is to promote the ufe procedure for patients suffering with uterine fibroids through our askufe awareness and education program and also to specifically promote our embosphere microspheres as the treatment of choice for the ufe procedure 
our success will depend upon the continued acceptance by the medical community  patients and third party payers of the ufe procedure  and our embosphere microspheres product and our other products  as safe  medically therapeutic and cost effective 
we have experienced operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
most of our expenditures to date have been for sales and marketing activities  general and administrative expenses and research and development activities 
we expect to incur operating losses in as we execute our business plan  including continuing to establish sales and marketing capabilities and conducting research and development activities 
on march   we announced that we have instituted a voluntary recall of our hepasphere microspheres in europe and japan to correct a packaging defect that we identified while conducting aging studies routinely performed on all of our product packaging 
hepasphere microspheres are contained in a prefilled vial that is in turn packaged inside a paper pouch 
we determined that a defect in the paper pouch may compromise the sterility of the outside of the vial 
if the sterility of the outside of the vial is not maintained  there is the risk that a physician s hands can become contaminated when handling the vial 
we are not aware of any adverse events resulting from the defects in the paper packaging 
sales of hepasphere microspheres outside of the united states are expected to resume once a new packaging design is produced and validated 
research and development the following table identifies each of the programs for which we have incurred research and development expenses in the years ended december   and and the current development phase of each

total research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing approximately  and of our total costs and expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our research and development functions typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  except for clinical expenses  a substantial amount of fixed research and development costs such as salary and salary related benefits  rent  equipment depreciation  utilities  insurance and maintenance are shared among various programs 
accordingly  we have not historically tracked specific costs for each of our research and development projects 
there is a risk that any medical device development program may not produce revenue 
moreover  because of uncertainties inherent in medical device development  including those factors described above under risk factors we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize the product candidates included in the table above 
we have obtained ce mark approval in the european union for our hepasphere microspheres  which are also in clinical evaluation in japan 
we have exclusive worldwide rights to the hepasphere microspheres technology under a license from dr 
shinichi hori  subject only to dr 
hori s right to conduct clinical trials on our behalf in japan  treat patients at rinku medical center and osaka medical center in japan and engage in research at osaka university 
we have submitted a k application to the fda seeking united states marketing clearance for our quadrasphere microspheres product candidate for the treatment of hypervascularized tumors and peripheral arteriovenous malformations 
our quadrasphere microspheres are identical in all respects to our hepasphere microspheres  which are marketed outside of the united states 
we are also conducting preclinical research of our mr embosphere microspheres product candidate for use in the treatment of uterine fibroids and liver cancer and of our embocath plus infusion microcatheters and sequitor steerable guidewires product candidates 
the successful development of these early stage product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medical devices  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us  future clinical trials results  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so are set forth in risk factors 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are most critical in gaining an understanding of our financial statements include policies and judgments relating to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories and deferred taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to gaining a full understanding of and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines summarized in staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists a valid purchase order from an approved customer  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
revenue from licensing agreements is recognized ratably over the period of the related agreement 
we establish reserves for potential sales returns and evaluate the adequacy of those reserves based upon realized experience 
under our current policy  only those products on a customer s initial order qualify for product satisfaction related credit returns 
to date  returns related to product satisfaction have been immaterial 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in product satisfaction and any resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
in june we entered into an exclusive five month development agreement with a third party for the use of embosphere microspheres for gerd 
in exchange for this agreement  we received a payment of  based upon the application of our revenue recognition policies and all related judgments and estimates  we recognized  as licensing revenue over the life of the contract  which concluded in november accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical payment experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
substantially all of our receivables are due from hospitals  distributors  health care clinics  and managed care systems located throughout the united states  canada  europe  asia and south america 
a significant portion of products sold  both foreign and domestic  is ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on liquidity and profitability of our customer base 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the market value for such inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities in process and on hand and record a provision for production loss and obsolete inventory based primarily on actual loss experience and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our costs of product sales at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our production process and forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in production yield or product demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue and margin overview for the years ended december  inc inc in thousands dec

total revenues costs of product sales gross margin gross margin revenues 
revenues increased million or in as compared to primarily due to the following an increase in revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in the united states of approximately million or as embosphere microsphere sales volume levels continued to increase as we execute our strategies to grow the ufe business in the united states  an increase in revenues from microspheres and delivery systems outside the united states of  or driven by an increase in embosphere microsphere sales volumes in france  germany and the united kingdom 
in april  we began a year long patient awareness program in france targeted at potential ufe patients through medical gynecologists offices  which we believe has contributed to the increase in sales volumes  and an increase in revenues from other products  which include barium delivery kits and other ancillary products  of approximately  or as a result of the timing of several hardware sales in the first quarter of offsetting these increases was a decrease in licensing revenue of  as a result of the conclusion of a five month agreement for the development of embosphere microspheres for the use in the prevention of gastroesphageal reflex disease  or gerd  which began in did not renew in cost of product sales 
cost of product sales for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  primarily due to the million write off for work in process inventory disposals due to manufacturing process improvements  and product replacements resulting from shelf life limitations that we recorded during and did not occur in the gross margin improvement of as a percentage of revenues for as compared to was primarily attributable to the additional costs in related to the inventory write off and the increase in sales in of embosphere microspheres in the united states  which provide our highest profit margins 
offsetting these improvements were costs associated with the initial production of our hepasphere microsphere product  which we introduced commercially in  and the decrease in licensing revenue 
we expect that future gross margin will be highly correlated with the following factors revenue growth  production levels  foreign exchange rate movements  terms and conditions of subcontracted manufacturer and supplier agreements  and future inventory reserve requirements 
expense overview for the years ended december  inc inc in thousands dec

research and development sales marketing general and administrative litigation costs total operating expenses research and development expense 
total research and development expense in increased  or as we increased spending by approximately  in support of our latest product  hepasphere microspheres  that we introduced commercially in europe in  and our product candidates  mr embosphere microspheres and our next generation delivery systems  which increased spending by approximately  to differentiate embosphere microspheres from competitive products 
offsetting these increases in were lower overhead costs achieved by the consolidation of space in our facility in rockland  massachusetts  at the end of the first quarter of we expect future spending for research and development to increase as we seek to provide further clinical research for our existing and future products 
sales expense 
sales expense for increased  or 
the primary reason for the increase was the higher revenue sales levels and improved performance resulting in higher incentive compensation for our sales personnel 
marketing expense 
marketing expense for decreased  or from the decrease was primarily due to the timing of spending on marketing programs over the course of as compared to in  such expenses included marketing support of an article on ufe in the wall street journal and other media coverage  including a segment in the television program these expenses did not recur at comparable levels in general and administrative and patent expense 
general  administrative and patent expenses for increased  or from the increase was primarily due to higher patent maintenance costs of approximately  higher legal costs related to the governance of our french subsidiary and employment issues of approximately  higher compensation costs for general and administrative personnel of approximately  and an increase in investor relations activities of approximately  offsetting these increases were costs related to the executive management transition  which did not occur in litigation costs 
in december  we paid damages in a lawsuit brought by terumo europe nv against our french subsidiary  biosphere medical nv terumo alleged that it suffered damages from a purported termination of the distribution contract by biosphere medical sa biosphere medical sa and terumo europe entered into a distribution agreement in january pursuant to which terumo europe became the exclusive distributor of embosphere microsphere and embogold microsphere products in certain countries of europe 
the commercial court of pontoise  france  determined that while both parties had ceased to perform their obligations under the agreement  we had not terminated the agreement in accordance with its terms 
accordingly  biosphere medical sa was required to pay terumo  in damages for breach of contract in december the  charge recorded in the fourth quarter of includes  of related accounts receivable written off in addition to the settlement payment 
interest income  net 
for the year ended december   interest income  net of interest expense  increased to  as compared to  in the increase in as compared to was due primarily to increases in the average daily invested cash balances and interest rates on available investment grade assets 
foreign exchange gains  net 
foreign exchange gains and losses primarily resulted from euro to us dollar foreign currency fluctuations on euro denominated intercompany trade accounts 
the foreign exchange losses during the year ended december  totaled approximately  compared to the foreign exchange gains realized of approximately  in the comparable period of these changes were primarily the result of fluctuation of the us dollar as compared to the euro and a decrease in euro denominated receivables 
income tax provision 
the income tax benefit of  primarily represents the realization of income tax benefits  as we recovered a portion of the taxes paid in france 
in the first quarter of  we determined that a portion of the benefit reversed in would be realized 
the income tax provision of  primarily represents the reversal of income tax benefits recorded during  as we initially determined in the fourth quarter of that we would not recover a portion of the taxes paid 
years ended december  and revenue and margin overview for the years ended december  inc inc in thousands dec 
dec 
total revenues costs of product sales gross margin gross margin revenues 
the million or increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily due to the following revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in the united states grew approximately  due to increasing market acceptance  which we believe is being fueled by increased adoption within the interventional radiologists community  increased awareness among fibroid patents due to media attention and increasing support of gynecologists  revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in europe increased approximately  due to increased market acceptance of our microspheres and delivery systems  revenues from microspheres and delivery systems in the rest of the world increased approximately  due to our renewed focus on these geographical areas during and to our obtaining approvals to sell our embocath catheter and segway guidewire products in canada and several other latin american countries  we derived  of licensing revenue from a five month agreement for the development of embosphere microspheres for use in the prevention of gerd  which concluded in the fourth quarter of  and finally  the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in accounted for approximately  of the increase 
cost of product sales 
the million or increase in cost of product sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following factors we recorded a write off of approximately  for in process embogold microsphere and embosphere microspheres inventory related to inventory produced prior to the implementation of an improved manufacturing process in our facility in france  and we recognized approximately  in costs of product sales related to product replacement of embogold microsphere and embosphere syringes 
this replacement was due to shelf life limitations of the saline solution contained within the syringes 
the gross margin decrease of  or as a percent of revenues was primarily attributable to the additional costs related to the write off of in process inventory and expenses associated with the product replaced as a result of the shelf limitations discussed above  offset by increased manufacturing efficiencies  net of foreign currency translation adjustments 
expense overview for the years ended december  inc inc in thousands dec 
dec 
research and development sales marketing general  administrative and patent litigation costs total operating expenses research and development expense 
the  or decrease in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a reduction in headcount  which decreased compensation related expenses by approximately  after the completion of development related projects in  offset by  of higher costs in france due to the stronger euro and an increase in activity on a joint project in france 
sales expense 
the  or decrease in sales expense in as compared to was due to the elimination of our national sales meeting  which decreased expense by approximately  and other savings on personnel costs  including travel and incentive compensation  which decreased expense by approximately  as selling costs were realigned with realized sales levels in the first half of offsetting these decreases were severance and hiring costs in the fourth quarter of  which totaled approximately  resulting from the departures and addition of certain senior management 
marketing expense 
the million or decrease in marketing expense in as compared to was primarily due to the reduction in expenses related to awareness and education programs associated with promoting the ufe procedure through our askufe campaign as well as a reduction in expenses relating to the promotion of embosphere microspheres  which decreased expenses by approximately million 
additional cost savings in came from reduced overall headcount  which decreased expenses by approximately  and from our decision to limit our head count presence at key trade shows as we sought to keep sales representatives focused on their key accounts in the field  which decreased expenses by approximately  general  administrative and patent expenses 
the  or increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to the executive transition and severance expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of in connection with the departure and hiring of certain executives of the company 
litigation costs 
in december  we paid damages in a lawsuit brought by terumo europe nv against our french subsidiary  biosphere medical nv as described in the previous section 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  is generally incurred in relation to capital leases 
for the year ended december   interest income  net of interest expense  was  as compared to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease in as compared to was due primarily to decreases in the average daily invested cash balances and interest rates on available investment grade assets 
foreign exchange gains  net 
foreign exchange gains and losses primarily resulted from realized euro to us dollar foreign currency fluctuations on euro denominated intercompany trade accounts 
the foreign exchange gains realized during totaled approximately  as compared to gains of approximately  realized during the  decrease was primarily due to higher average intercompany trade receivables  which are denominated in euros  offset by a decrease in the rate that the euro strengthened against the dollar during as compared to income tax provision 
the income tax provision of  primarily represents the reversal of income tax benefits recorded during as we determined in the fourth quarter of that a portion of the taxes paid would not be recovered 
the income tax provision represents minimum corporate taxes due in both france and in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of our operating loss offset by proceeds from stock option exercises by former employees and euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate changes 
we have historically funded our operations from the net proceeds provided by public and private equity offerings  net revenues  bank financing  equipment financing leases and  to a lesser extent  the exercise of stock options 
the net cash used in operating activities includes a net loss of million adjusted for  in working capital changes 
accounts receivable increased  on higher sales offset by a two day improvement in days sales outstanding  which decreased to days from days at december  during  we spent  to purchase manufacturing equipment at our facility in roissy  france to produce our michrosphere products  including  specifically to produce hepasphere microspheres  and we spent an additional  to purchase other equipment to support our existing infrastructure 
net cash provided by financing activities was  during  which included  from employee equity incentive plans and  from equipment financing offset by scheduled principal payments  such as those on existing lease arrangements  and additional costs associated with our private placement of series a preferred stock in the fourth quarter of on february   we sold  shares of the common stock at a price per share of to several investors in a private placement 
we received net proceeds of approximately million 
borrowing arrangements in september  we entered into a five year capital lease agreement for the purchase of communication equipment at our facility in rockland  massachusetts 
the amount of the lease is  payable over months  at an effective annual interest rate of 
as of december  there was  outstanding under this capital lease agreement 
we currently have a credit facility with a bank under which we may borrow up to million for general working capital and corporate purposes  subject to limitations defined in the agreement 
the credit facility was to expire in june  and in that month we entered into an agreement to extend the credit facility for an additional two years 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of december  each available   or day advance will bear interest at a per annum rate  at our option  equal to either i a variable rate as determined by the bank or ii a rate equal to the corresponding   or day libor rate as of december  plus a libor advance rate spread as determined by certain current working capital balances at the time of the advance 
in connection with the credit facility  we entered into a security agreement pursuant to which we have pledged to the bank all of our us assets  excluding our equity ownership of our subsidiaries  as collateral 
other contractual obligations as of december   we are party to two operating leases for our facilities in rockland  massachusetts and roissy  france 
the roissy  france operating lease expires in may on february   we amended the lease for the office and laboratory facility we currently occupy in rockland  massachusetts 
pursuant to that amendment  the leased premises has been increased to a total area of approximately  square feet at a monthly cost of  per month  and the term of the lease is extended from march  to february  in addition to the capital lease agreement we entered into in september  we are party to several other non cancelable capital lease agreements with various equipment financing companies  related to the acquisition of certain manufacturing and computer equipment during and the equipment leases have initial terms of to months with interest rates of to 
equipment leased under these arrangements serves as pledged capital with respect to each capital lease agreement 
future cash payments  including interest  under contractual obligations in effect as of december   are as follows period total contractual in thousands thereafter obligations operating leases capital leases other contractual obligations total we believe that the approximate million in cash and cash equivalents that we have as of december   together with anticipated proceeds from sales of our microspheres  delivery systems and other products  together with the net proceeds of approximately million from our placement of  shares of common stock  which was completed on february   will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned through in the longer term  we expect to fund our operations and sustain capital requirements through a combination of expected proceeds from product sales and capital equipment financing 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  our failure to achieve expected revenue amounts  costs associated with changes in our ufe marketing programs  anticipated research and development expenses  the scope and results of pre clinical and clinical testing  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the timing and results of fda regulatory review and the market s acceptance of any approved products  including our embosphere microspheres for ufe and hepasphere microspheres 
we may incur additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our manufacturing  laboratory and administrative functions  as well as costs relating to further market development and commercialization efforts 
we may also need additional funds for such activities and for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies 
these additional funds may be substantial and raised from time to time through additional public or private sales of equity  through borrowings  or through other financings 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that may be required  or that any such funding will be on acceptable terms 
related party transactions we did not have any related party transactions during off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we believe that the effects of inflation generally do not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment which  as revised  we refer to as sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board no 
 or apb  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
in april  the sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas r 
the sec s new rule requires companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas r as of january  we expect to use the modified prospective transition method and will not restate prior periods for the adoption of sfas r 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position and cash position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date 
however  based on our current assumptions we expect the adoption of sfas r to increase our compensation costs by approximately million in in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of accounting research bulletin  or arb  no 
 chapter  or sfas sfas is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board  or iasb  toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
the fasb and the iasb noted that arb no 
 chapter and international accounting standard no 
 inventories  or ias  require that abnormal amounts of idle freight  handling costs  and wasted materials be recognized as period costs  however  the fasb and the iasb noted that differences in the wording of the two standards could lead to inconsistent application of those similar requirements 
the fasb concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in arb no 
by adopting language similar to that used in ias no 
is consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the united states and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally 
adoption of sfas is required for fiscal years beginning after june  the provisions of sfas will be applied prospectively 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect it will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments 
however  in the future  we may consider certain financing instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  or alternative instruments  which may be considered derivative in nature 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our operations in france 
operations in france are denominated in the euro  and as of december   approximately euro  or million  remained outstanding within the inter company trade accounts 
accordingly  a hypothetical percent increase in euro to us dollar conversion rates would result in an approximate  foreign currency market to market change in the fair value of our inter company trade account balance as of december  we have not engaged in formal currency hedging activities to date  but do have a limited natural hedge in that our revenues and expenses in france are primarily denominated in the euro 
we also attempt to minimize exchange rate risk by converting non us currency to non us dollars as often as practicable 
we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries operating under a functional currency the euro other than our reporting currency the us dollar as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the other accumulated comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
because our foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material  no quantitative tabular disclosure has been provided 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in money market funds 
due to the conservative nature of our investments  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated
