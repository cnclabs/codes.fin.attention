item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and nonutility operations 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following regulatory trends and decisions  including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  adverse weather conditions  such as warmer than normal weather in our utility service territories or colder than normal weather that could adversely affect our natural gas marketing activities  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in one state  impact of environmental regulations on our business  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  our ability to continue to access the capital markets  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas  including the volatility of natural gas prices  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits  the capital intensive nature of our distribution business  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our distribution business  and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  especially in item a above  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview in fiscal  we earned million in net income or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal the nine percent year over year increase in net income was primarily attributable strong financial results in our natural gas marketing segment as it was able to capture higher margins in a volatile natural gas market and favorable unrealized mark to market gains 
additionally  pipeline and storage net income increased percent compared with the prior year 
these positive results helped overcome the adverse effects on our utility segment of weather adjusted for wna that 
table of contents was percent warmer than normal  the adverse effect of hurricane katrina on our louisiana division and a non recurring  noncash charge to impair certain assets 
our utility operations contributed million per diluted share or percent to fiscal results 
our nonutility operations  comprised of our natural gas marketing  pipeline and storage and other nonutility segments  contributed million per diluted share or percent to fiscal results 
key financial and other events for fiscal include the following our utility segment net income decreased million during the year ended september  compared with the year ended september  the decrease primarily resulted from the impact of weather  as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather normalized rates  that was two percent warmer than the prior year period and percent warmer than normal  coupled with higher operating expenses 
utility segment results also reflect a million net of tax charge associated with the impairment of the west texas division s irrigation assets 
during fiscal  our louisiana and mid tex divisions received wna in their rate designs that will go into effect in fiscal after receiving wna in these two jurisdictions  we will have weather protection for over percent of our residential and commercial meters for the winter heating season 
our natural gas marketing segment net income increased million during the year ended september  compared with the year ended september  the increase in natural gas marketing net income primarily reflects an increase in our unrealized margin of million and increased realized margins due to our ability to capture higher margins in a volatile natural gas market 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses and increased interest charges resulting from increased short term borrowings to fund working capital needs 
our pipeline and storage segment net income increased million during the year ended september  compared with the year ended september  increased gross profit margin resulting from higher transportation and related services margins coupled with increased throughput on our atmos pipeline texas system and atmos pipeline storage  llc s ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads in its asset management contracts were partially offset by higher operating expenses 
our capitalization ratio at september  was percent compared with percent at september  reflecting the impact of increased short term debt borrowings to fund working capital needs partially offset by current year net income 
for the year ended september   we generated million in operating cash flow compared with million for the year ended september   reflecting the adverse impact of high natural gas costs on our working capital 
capital expenditures increased to million from million primarily reflecting increased capital spending for various pipeline expansion projects in our atmos pipeline texas division 
our financial performance is discussed in greater detail below in results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly 
actual results may differ from estimates 

table of contents regulation our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement requires cost based  rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements 
we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable 
regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulators and are subject to refund 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments  but they do provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 
energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
derivatives and hedging activities in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility customers against gas price volatility 
table of contents during the winter heating season 
the financial derivatives we use in our utility segment are accounted for under the mark to market method pursuant to sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the valuation of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts  the maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions 
however  because the costs of financial derivatives used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates  current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives 
the changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 
our natural gas marketing risk management activities are conducted through our natural gas marketing segment 
this segment is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas  which we manage through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
option contracts provide the right  but not the requirement  to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price 
swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date 
the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies  which are monitored for compliance daily 
we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives  we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
under sfas  natural gas inventory is designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge by aem and atmos pipeline and storage llc 
this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
effective october  we changed the index used to value our physical natural gas from inside ferc to gas daily to better reflect the prices of our physical commodity 
this change had no material impact on our financial position on the date of adoption 
costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred 
we recognize revenue and the carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility 
derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change 
the difference in the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedges nymex are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
we continually manage our positions and seek to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change 
we elect to exclude the differential between the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair value hedges 
similar to our inventory position  we attempt to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with our fixed price contracts with minimum volume requirements through the use of various offsetting derivatives 
prior to april  these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas because they naturally locked in the economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the contract 
the fixed price forward and offsetting derivative contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
the unrealized gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixed price contract and the derivatives settled 
to the extent that the 
table of contents unrealized gains and losses of the fixed price forward contracts and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly  our earnings experienced some volatility 
at delivery  the gains and losses on the fixed price contracts were offset by gains and losses on the derivatives  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
effective april  we elected to treat our fixed price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales 
as a result  we ceased marking the fixed price forward contracts to market 
we designated the offsetting derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions 
as a result of this change  unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts have been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
additionally  we utilize storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
although the purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities  these derivative instruments have not been designated as hedges 
accordingly  these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included in revenue in our natural gas marketing segment 
during fiscal  we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of million of long term debt 
we designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
these treasury lock agreements were settled in october with a net million payment to the counterparties 
this realized loss is being recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangements 
the fair value of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges  prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods 
changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined our reporting units to be each of our utility divisions and wholly owned subsidiaries 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in 
table of contents these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june measurement date 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately million

for service areas that have weather normalized operations  normal degree days are used instead of actual degree days in computing the total number of heating degree days 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  utility segment our utility segment has historically contributed to percent of our consolidated net income 
however  during fiscal  our utility segment contributed approximately percent of our consolidated net income primarily due to the adverse effect of significantly warmer than normal weather  the adverse effect of hurricane katrina and a non recurring  noncash charge to recognize the impairment of our irrigation assets 
the primary factors that impact the results of our utility operations are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas sales to residential  commercial and public authority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
accordingly  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  we typically experience higher levels of accounts receivable  accounts payable  gas stored underground and short term debt balances during the winter heating season due to the seasonal nature of our revenues and the need to purchase and store gas to support these operations 
utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive 
changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers 
accordingly  we believe gross profit margin is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve or  in the case of industrial customers  to use alternative energy sources 
higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt 
table of contents expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
the effects of weather that is above or below normal are substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments in most of our service areas 
wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 
accordingly  in our wna service areas  our gross profit margin should be based substantially on the amount of gross profit that would result from normal weather  despite actual weather conditions that may be either warmer or colder than normal 
during fiscal  we received wna in our two most weather sensitive jurisdictions the louisiana and mid tex divisions 
with the addition of wna in these two jurisdictions  we will have weather protection for over percent of our residential and commercial meters for the winter heating season 
prior to these decisions  there was limited weather protection in these jurisdictions 
the louisiana division had previously benefited from a higher base customer charge 
however  this rate structure was not as beneficial during periods where weather was significantly warmer than normal 
in may  the lpsc approved a settlement that provided for a modified wna which provides a partial decoupling mechanism to stabilize this jurisdiction s margins 
the approved wna will cover a period from december to march 
prior to october   the mid tex division  which is our largest utility division and contains almost percent of our approximately million distribution customers  had benefited from a rate structure that combined a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmer than normal weather on revenue 
the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provided for the recovery of a significant portion of our fixed costs for such operations under average weather conditions 
however  this rate structure was not as beneficial during periods where weather was significantly warmer than normal 
in july  in connection with the mid tex division rate proceeding the rrc approved an interim and a permanent wna effective october  for the mid tex division 
the wna covers the period from october through may 
the interim wna is based on years of weather history  and the permanent wna will be modified or adjusted to conform to the rate design that the rrc ultimately approves in the rate proceeding  which proceeding is described in greater detail under recent ratemaking activity 
in the pending rate proceeding before the rrc  we are seeking for our mid tex division additional annual revenues of approximately million and several rate design changes including revenue stabilization and recovery of the gas cost component of bad debt expense 
while the outcome of the mid tex division s pending rate proceeding before the rrc cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that we have adequately demonstrated to the rrc that the mid tex division is entitled to receive an increase in annual revenues and that the remaining rate design changes should be implemented 
however  if the rrc were to deny an increase in the mid tex division s rates or not allow new rate design changes the mid tex division has requested  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the future 
operating income utility gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our utility business was bcf during the current year compared to bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit  despite lower throughput  primarily reflects higher franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes  which are paid by utility customers and have no permanent effect on net income 
additionally  margins increased approximately million due to rate increases received from our fiscal and fiscal grip filings and the recognition of million that had been previously deferred in louisiana following the lpsc s ratification of our agreement in may these increases were partially offset by approximately million due to the impact of significantly warmer than normal weather  particularly in our mid tex and louisiana divisions 
for the year ended september   weather was 
table of contents percent warmer than normal  as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather normalized operations and two percent warmer than the prior year 
in the mid tex and louisiana divisions  which did not have weather normalized rates during the winter heating season  weather was percent and percent warmer than normal 
additionally  utility gross profit decreased approximately million compared with the prior year in the louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina 
service has been restored in some areas affected by the storm  however  it is not likely that service will be restored to all of the affected service areas 
as more fully described under recent ratemaking activity  we implemented new rates in september that reflect the impact of hurricane katrina 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase reflects a million increase in taxes  primarily related to franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes  both of which are calculated as a percentage of revenue  and are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills 
although these amounts are included as a component of revenue in accordance with our tariffs  timing differences between when these amounts are billed to our customers and when we recognize the associated expense may affect net income favorably or unfavorably on a temporary basis 
however  there is no permanent effect on net income 
operation and maintenance expense  excluding the provision for doubtful accounts  increased million primarily due to higher employee costs associated with increased headcount to fill positions that were previously outsourced to a third party  higher medical and dental claims and increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal costs 
increased line locate  telecommunication and facilities costs also contributed to the overall increase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in third party costs for outsourced administrative and meter reading functions that were in sourced during fiscal operation and maintenance expense for the year ended september  was also favorably impacted by the absence of million of merger and integration cost amortization associated with the merger of united cities gas company in july  as these costs were fully amortized by december the provision for doubtful accounts increased million to million for the year ended september   compared with million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased collection risk associated with higher natural gas prices 
in the utility segment  the average cost of natural gas for the year ended september  was per mcf  compared with per mcf for the year ended september  additionally  during the first quarter of fiscal  the mpsc  in connection with the modification of our rate design described in recent ratemaking activity  decided to allow the recovery of million in deferred costs  which it had originally disallowed in its september decision 
this charge was originally recorded in fiscal this ruling decreased our depreciation expense during the year ended september  this decrease was offset by increased depreciation expense associated with the placement of various capital projects into service during the fiscal year 
operating expenses were also impacted by million noncash charge to impair our west texas division s irrigation assets 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  we determined that  as a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with our agricultural customers shift from gas powered pumps to electric pumps  the west texas division s irrigation assets would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from operations to recover the net investment in these assets 
therefore  the entire net book value was written off 
we will continue to operate these assets until we determine a plan for these assets as we are obligated to provide natural gas services to certain customers served by these assets 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our utility segment operating income for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  
table of contents miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million compared to miscellaneous income of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income on intercompany borrowings to our natural gas marketing segment to fund its working capital needs 
this increase was partially offset by a million charge recorded during the fiscal second quarter associated with an adverse ruling in tennessee related to the calculation of a performance based rate mechanism associated with gas purchases 
interest charges interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding short term debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices coupled with an approximate basis point increase in the interest rate on our million unsecured floating rate senior notes due due to an increase in the three month libor rate 
these increases were partially offset by million of interest savings arising from the early payoff of million of our first mortgage bonds in june natural gas marketing segment our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
to facilitate this process  we utilize proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products 
as a result  our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 
to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control  we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts  we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
operating income gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of marketing activities  which represent the utilization of proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  and storage activities  which are derived from the optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets 

table of contents our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the year ended september  and year ended september in thousands  except physical position storage activities realized margin unrealized margin total storage activities marketing activities realized margin unrealized margin total marketing activities gross profit net physical position bcf our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was million for the year ended september  compared to gross profit of million for the year ended september  gross profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september  included an unrealized gain of million compared with an unrealized loss of million in the prior year 
natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intersegment sales volumes  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin opportunities partially offset by warmer than normal weather across our market areas 
our storage activities generated million in gross profit margin for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  lower realized margins in our storage operations were primarily due to the realization of less favorable arbitrage spreads compared with the prior year coupled with increased storage fees 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the unrealized loss associated with these operations due to a favorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and our fixed price forward contracts 
these decreases were also favorably impacted by positive basis ineffectiveness resulting from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and the delivery location specified in the derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge 
these results were magnified by a bcf increase in our net physical position at september  compared to the prior year 
we continually seek opportunities to increase the amount of our storage capacity 
to the extent we obtain and utilize new capacity and experience price volatility  the amount of our unrealized storage contribution could increase in future periods 
our marketing activities generated million in gross profit margin for the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  this increase reflects increased realized margins coupled with a favorable unrealized margin variance compared with the prior year 
the increase in our realized marketing operations was primarily attributable to successfully capturing increased margins in certain market areas that experienced higher market volatility 
the favorable unrealized margin variance was primarily due to favorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward natural gas prices associated with financial derivatives used in these activities and positive basis ineffectiveness on those financial derivatives 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the 
table of contents year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 
the improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  interest charges interest charges allocated to the natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices 
pipeline and storage segment our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage  llc aps  which were previously included in our other nonutility segment 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of inventory on hand 
these operations represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central  northern and eastern texas  extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas 
this pipeline system provides access to nine basins located in texas  which are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the nation s remaining onshore natural gas reserves 
aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana 
we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 
similar to our utility segment  our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas transportation requirements are affected by the winter heating season requirements of our customers 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
further  as the atmos pipeline texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our mid tex division  the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division 
as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

table of contents operating income gross profit margin for our pipeline and storage segment primarily consists of transportation margins earned from our mid tex division and from third parties  other ancillary pipeline services and asset management fees earned by aps 
our pipeline and storage segment s gross profit margin was comprised of the following components for the year ended september  and year ended september in thousands mid tex transportation third party transportation asset management fees storage and park and lend services unrealized gains losses other gross profit pipeline and storage gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intersegment transportation volumes  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased third party throughput and ancillary services  coupled with increased margins on aps asset management contracts 
increased third party throughput on atmos pipeline texas was primarily attributable to increases in the electric generation market due to the warmer than normal temperatures during the summer of  increased demand for through system transportation services due to a widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline s hubs and the impact of atmos pipeline texas north side loop and other compression projects that were placed into service in june storage and parking and lending services on atmos pipeline texas also increased during fiscal as a result of the widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline s hubs  which increased the attractiveness of storing gas on the pipeline and our ability to obtain improved margins for these services 
the increases on atmos pipeline texas system were partially offset by a decrease in margins earned from intercompany transportation services to our mid tex division due to the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced during fiscal additionally  these increases were partially offset by the absence of inventory sales of million realized in the prior year 
increases in aps margins due to its ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads on its asset management contracts also contributed to this segment s improved gross profit margin 
these improved margins reflect an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with these contracts 
during fiscal  favorable movements in the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against the physical inventory underlying these contracts resulted in an unrealized gain compared with an unrealized loss in the prior year 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  due to higher employee benefit costs associated with the increase in headcount  increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal costs  higher facilities costs and higher pipeline integrity costs 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our pipeline and storage segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  
table of contents other nonutility segment our other nonutility businesses consist primarily of the operations of atmos energy services  llc  and atmos power systems  inc through aes  we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations  other than the mid tex division 
these services  which began april  include aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices 
the revenues of aes represent charges to our utility divisions equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 
through atmos power systems  inc  we have constructed electric peaking power generating plants and associated facilities and have entered into agreements to lease these plants 
operating income for this segment primarily reflects the leasing income associated with two sales type lease transactions completed in and and was essentially unchanged for the year ended september  compared with the prior year 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  utility segment operating income utility gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our utility business was bcf during the current year compared to bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the mid tex division resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of million and bcf 
the million increase in the gross profit generated from our other utility operations primarily reflects rate increases in our mississippi and west texas divisions that were absent in the prior year coupled with the recognition of a million refund to our customers in our colorado service area in the prior year 
offsetting these increases was a million reduction in gross profit in our louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina 
gross profit margins  particularly in louisiana  were also adversely impacted by weather as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather normalized operations that was five percent warmer than normal and one percent warmer than the prior year period 
additionally  gross profit margin was adversely impacted by the lack of cold weather in patterns sufficient to encourage customers to increase their heat load consumption and lower irrigation throughput in our west texas and colorado kansas divisions 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily as a result of the addition of the mid tex division 
excluding the impact of the mid tex division  operating expenses for our other utility operations increased million primarily due to million associated with the effects of hurricane katrina  a million increase in taxes  other than income  a million increase in operation and maintenance expense  including the provision for doubtful accounts  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization 
included in taxes other than income taxes are franchise and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills 
although these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings  timing differences between when the expense is incurred and is recovered may impact our net income on a temporary basis 
however  there is no permanent effect on net income 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our utility segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income earned 
table of contents on higher cash balances during the current year compared with the prior year partially offset by the recognition of a million gain on the sale of a building during the year ended september  interest charges interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to the interest expense associated with the issuance of long term debt to finance the acquisition of the mid tex division in october on june   we repaid million in principal on five series of our first mortgage bonds prior to their scheduled maturities 
the early repayment of these bonds resulted in savings of million in interest expense in fiscal natural gas marketing segment operating income our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the years ended september  and year ended september in thousands  except physical position storage activities realized margin unrealized margin total storage activities marketing activities realized margin unrealized margin total marketing activities gross profit net physical position bcf our natural gas marketing segment s gross profit margin was million for the year ended september  compared to gross profit of million for the year ended september  gross profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september  included an unrealized loss of million compared with an unrealized loss of million in the prior year 
natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intersegment sales volumes  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes primarily was attributable to successfully executed marketing strategies into new market areas 
the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a gain of million for the year ended september  compared to a loss of million for the year ended september  the million improvement primarily was attributable to a million increase in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september  compared to the prior year due to more favorable arbitrage spread opportunities during the current year  partially offset by increased storage fees associated with bcf of newly contracted storage capacity during the third quarter of fiscal annual demand charges for this new storage approximate million 
we may further increase the amount of our storage capacity in the future  therefore  the impact of price volatility on our unrealized storage contribution could become more significant in future periods 

table of contents a million decrease in the unrealized storage contribution resulted from an unfavorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments combined with greater physical natural gas storage quantities at september  compared to the prior year also 
our marketing activities contributed million to our gross profit for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to million of unrealized marked to market losses associated with basis swaps that were put in place to capture margins in certain volatile market areas 
the increase in unrealized marked to market losses was partially offset by an increase in our realized marketing margins due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin customers and successfully entering into new market areas 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to an increase in labor costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 
the increase in gross profit margin  combined with higher operating expenses  resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  pipeline and storage segment operating income pipeline and storage gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the year ended september  compared with bcf for the prior year 
excluding intersegment transportation volumes  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the current year 
the increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the atmos pipeline texas division resulting in an increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin and total transportation volumes of million and bcf 
also contributing to atmos pipeline texas division s results were higher transportation and related services margin due to significant basis differentials at its three major texas hubs 
the million decrease in the gross profit generated by aps primarily reflects a decrease in asset management fees received during fiscal operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  due to the addition of million in operating expenses associated with the atmos pipeline texas division 
as the atmos pipeline texas division is a regulated entity  franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no permanent effect on net income 
included in operating expense was million associated with taxes other than income taxes  of which million was associated with our atmos pipeline texas division 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our pipeline and storage segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  interest charges interest charges allocated to this segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to the interest expense associated with the issuance of long term debt to finance the acquisition of the atmos pipeline texas division in october 
table of contents other nonutility segment operating income for our other nonutility segment primarily reflects the leasing income associated with two sales type lease transactions completed in fiscal and the increase in operating income during the year ended september  reflects the absence of a one time charge of million associated with the wind down of a noncore business during fiscal miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million compared with million for the year ended september  the million decrease was attributable primarily to the recognition of a million pretax gain on the sale of all remaining limited partnership interests in heritage propane partners  lp during fiscal liquidity and capital resources our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditure and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds  borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets 
we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal these facilities are described in greater detail below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capitalization the following presents our capitalization as of september  and september in thousands  except percentages short term debt long term debt shareholders equity total capitalization  including short term debt total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to an increase in our short term debt borrowings to fund our working capital needs partially offset by current year net income 
our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements 
within three to five years  we intend to reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of to percent through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets 
cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors 
cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily attributable to working capital changes within our utility segment resulting from the impact of weather  the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 
for the year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

table of contents year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices 
year over year  unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by million 
partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections million and reduced payments for natural gas inventories million 
additionally  favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in a margin account and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by million 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the effects of a million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices 
working capital management efforts  which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  favorably affected operating cash flow by million 
however  these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by million  primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices  and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a percent year over year increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels  which reduced operating cash flow by million 
operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities  which resulted in a net liability for the segment 
accordingly  under the terms of the associated derivative contracts  we were required to deposit million into a margin account 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows were favorably impacted by several items 
improved customer collections during fiscal  compared with the prior year  resulted in a million increase in operating cash flow 
further  cash used for natural gas inventories decreased by million compared with the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to lower injections of natural gas into storage  partially offset by higher prices 
the reduction in the lag between the time period when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow by million 
changes in cash held on deposit in margin accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of million 
this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities 
the favorable change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of financial instruments held by aem represented a net asset position at september   which eliminated the need to place cash in margin accounts 
finally  other working capital and other changes improved operating cash flow by million 
these changes primarily related to various increases in deferred credits and other liabilities  other current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior year 
cash flows from investing activities during the last three years  a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions and growth projects  our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems 
our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  to expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets  to enhance the integrity of our pipelines and  more recently  to expand our intrastate pipeline network 
in executing our current rate strategy  we are directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a return on our investment timely 
currently  our mid tex  louisiana  mississippi and west texas utility divisions and our atmos pipeline texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 
for the year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended 
table of contents september  the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal primarily reflects increased spending associated with our dallas fort worth metroplex north side loop project and other pipeline expansion projects in our atmos pipeline texas division  which were completed during the fiscal third quarter 
increased capital spending in our mid tex division for various projects also contributed to the increase in our capital expenditures 
our cash used for investing activities for the year ended september  reflects the billion cash paid for the txu gas acquisition including related transaction costs and expenses 
cash flow from investing activities for the year ended september  reflects the receipt of million from the sale of our limited and general partnership interests in usp and heritage propane partners  lp and from the sale of a building 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended september   our financing activities provided million in cash compared with billion and million provided for the years ended september  and our significant financing activities for the years ended september   and are summarized as follows in october  we sold million shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of million shares  under a shelf registration statement declared effective in september  generating net proceeds of million 
additionally  we issued billion of senior unsecured debt under our shelf registration statement with an initial weighted average effective interest rate on these notes of percent 
the net proceeds from these issuances  combined with the net proceeds from our july common stock offering were used to finance the acquisition of our mid tex and atmos pipeline texas divisions and settle treasury lock agreements  into which we entered to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with million of the billion long term debt we issued in october to fund the acquisition 
during the years ended september  and  we increased our borrowings under our short term facilities by million and million whereas during the year ended september   we repaid a net million under our short term facilities 
net borrowings under our short term facilities during fiscal and reflect the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices than in prior years 
we repaid million of long term debt during the year ended september  compared with million during the year ended september  and million during the year ended september  fiscal payments reflected the repayment of million of our first mortgage bonds 
in connection with this repayment we paid a million make whole premium in accordance with the terms of the agreements and accrued interest of approximately million 
in accordance with regulatory requirements  the premium has been deferred and will be recognized over the remaining original lives of the first mortgage bonds that were repaid 
the early repayment of these bonds resulted in interest savings of million and million in fiscal and during the year ended september   we paid million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of million and million for the years ended september  and the increase in dividends paid over the prior year reflects an increase in the dividend rate from per share during the year ended september  to per share during the year ended september  combined with new share issuances under our various plans 
during the year ended september  we issued million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  we granted million shares of common stock under 
table of contents our long term incentive plan to directors  officers and other participants in the plan 
the following table shows the number of shares issued for the years ended september   and for the year ended september shares issued direct stock purchase plan retirement savings plan long term incentive plan long term stock plan for mid states division outside directors stock for fee plan october offering july offering total shares issued shelf registration in december  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue  from time to time  up to million in new common stock and or debt 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec in january in july  we sold million shares of our common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option  which exhausted the remaining availability under this registration statement 
in august  we filed a registration statement with the sec to issue  from time to time  up to billion in new common stock and or debt  which became effective in september in october  we sold million common shares  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of million shares  under this registration statement  generating net proceeds of million before other offering costs 
additionally  we issued billion of senior unsecured debt under the registration statement 
after issuing the debt and equity in october  we had approximately million of availability remaining under this registration statement 
however  we are no longer allowed to issue securities under that registration statement by applicable state regulatory commissions since we are in the process of securing their approval to issue a total of million in securities under a new shelf registration statement  including the remaining million of capacity carried over from the currently effective registration statement 
we intend to file this new registration statement with the sec in the near future 
credit facilities as of september   we maintained three short term committed credit facilities totaling million 
we also maintain one uncommitted credit facility totaling million and  through aem  a second uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to million 
borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a when and as needed basis at the discretion of the banks 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder winter months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
our cash needs for working capital have increased substantially as a result of the significant increase in the price of natural gas 
in october  our million day committed credit facility expired and was replaced with a million three year revolving credit facility 
in addition  in november  we entered into a new million day revolving credit facility with substantially the same terms as our million credit facility 

table of contents in november  we renewed our million day revolving credit facility and were in the process of replacing our three year million facility with a five year million revolving credit facility 
both facilities are being renewed with substantially the same terms as their predecessor facilities 
in april  our million committed unsecured credit facility was renewed for one year with no material changes to its terms and pricing 
at september   million was outstanding under this facility 
as of september   the amount available to us under these credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit  was million 
we believe these credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our increased working capital needs 
these facilities are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  aem amended its uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to increase the amount of credit available from million to a maximum of million 
in march  aem amended and extended this uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to march at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risks associated with our utility and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate

our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
debt covenants we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september  if we do not comply with our debt covenants  we may be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand  provide additional collateral or take other corrective actions 
our two public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures  as well as both our revolving credit agreements  each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of million to in excess of million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity 
in addition  aem s credit agreement contains a cross default provision whereby aem would be in default if it defaults on other indebtedness  as defined  by at least thousand in the aggregate 
additionally  this agreement 
table of contents contains a provision that would limit the amount of credit available if atmos were downgraded below an s p rating of bbb and a moody s rating of baa except as described above  we have no triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price  nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other triggering events 
additional information concerning our debt covenants and how we complied with those covenants is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance  or in the case of floating rate debt  the rate that was in effect as of september  gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract  adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of september  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our natural gas marketing and other utility segments 
contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our utility segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms

represents liabilities for natural gas commodity derivative contracts that were valued as of september  the ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the derivative contracts are settled 
represents expected contributions to our postretirement benefit plans 
aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts 
at september   aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year  bcf between one to three years and bcf after three years under indexed 
table of contents contracts 
aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 
with the exception of our mid tex division  our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september  are reflected in the table above 
in may  we announced plans to form a joint venture with a local natural gas producer to construct a natural gas gathering system in eastern kentucky that will originate in floyd county  kentucky  and extend north approximately miles to interconnect with the tennessee gas pipeline in carter county  kentucky 
tennessee gas pipeline s interstate system delivers natural gas to the northeastern united states  including new york city and boston 
referred to as the straight creek project  the new system is expected to relieve severe gas gathering and transportation constraints that historically have burdened natural gas producers in the area and should improve delivery reliability to natural gas customers 
more than a dozen other producers have signed memoranda of understanding to commit gas volumes to the new system and to enter into agreements on commercially reasonable terms 
as currently designed  the project is expected to cost between million to million 
in october  ferc issued a declaratory order finding that the straight creek project will be exempt from ferc jurisdiction 
upon receiving all required regulatory approvals  construction is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal  with operations expected to begin in fiscal final terms of the joint venture are still being negotiated  however  we anticipate that we will have the ability to consolidate the joint venture 
risk management activities we conduct risk management activities through our utility  natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments 
in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the derivatives being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
in our natural gas marketing segment  hedge ineffectiveness resulting from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments referred to as basis ineffectiveness for both fair value and cash flow hedges was an unrealized gain of approximately million for the year ended september  and an unrealized loss of approximately million and million for the years ended september  and actual hedge ineffectiveness resulting from the timing of settlement of physical contracts and the settlement of the derivative instruments referred to as timing ineffectiveness resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately million and million for the years ended september  and and an unrealized loss of approximately million for the year ended september  in our pipeline and storage segment  timing ineffectiveness resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately million and less than million for the years ended september  and and an unrealized gain of approximately million for the year ended september  finally  during fiscal  we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of million of long 
table of contents term debt 
these treasury lock agreements were settled in october with a net million payment to the counterparties 
approximately million of the million obligation is being recognized as a component of interest expense over a five year period from the date of settlement  and the remaining amount  approximately million  is being recognized as a component of interest expense over a ten year period from the date of settlement 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative 
substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices

aem purchases physical natural gas and then sells financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in a gross profit margin 
aem is able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
effective october   we changed the index used to value our physical natural gas from inside ferc to gas daily to better reflect the prices of our physical commodity 
this change had no material impact to the company on the date of adoption 
derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory  which are designated as fair value hedges  are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income 
over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  therefore  the economic gross profit aem captured in the original transaction remains essentially unchanged 

table of contents aem continually manages its positions to enhance the future economic profit it captured in the original transaction 
therefore  aem may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective 
aem monitors the impacts of these profit optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit that it captured and expects to collect through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives  which we refer to as the economic gross profit 
the economic gross profit  combined with the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in the financial statements in prior periods  provides a measure of the gross profit that could occur in future periods if aem s optimization efforts are fully successful 
the following table presents aem s economic gross profit and its potential gross profit for the last three fiscal years 
associated net economic unrealized potential net physical gross profit loss gross profit period ending position bcf in millions in millions in millions september  september  september  as of september   based upon aem s derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule  the economic gross profit was million 
in addition  million of net unrealized losses were recorded in the financial statements as of september  therefore  the potential gross profit was million 
this potential gross profit amount will not result in an equal increase in future net income as aem will incur additional storage and other operational expenses to realize this amount 
the economic gross profit is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules  and the realization of the economic gross profit is contingent upon the execution of this plan  weather and other execution factors 
since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position  it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot assure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of september  will be fully realized in the future or in what time period 
further  if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions  our earnings could be adversely impacted 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ended september   our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was million  compared with million and million for the years ended september  and all of these costs are recoverable through our gas utility rates  however  a portion of these costs is capitalized into our utility rate base 
the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with the prior year primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june  the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
in the period leading up to our june  measurement date  these interest rates were declining  which resulted in a basis point reduction in our discount rate to percent 
this reduction increased the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses 
additionally  we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points to percent  which also increased our pension and postretirement benefit cost 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects an increase in our service cost associated with the increase in the number of employees 
table of contents covered by our plans due to the txu gas acquisition 
although we did not assume the existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of txu gas  for purposes of determining our annual pension cost we agreed to give the transitioned employees credit for years of txu gas service under our pension plan 
with respect to our postretirement medical plan  we received a credit of million against the purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical plan 
the million credit approximated the actuarially determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to the past service of the transferred employees on the acquisition date 
in addition to the increased number of employees covered by the plans  we changed the assumptions used to determine our fiscal benefit costs  which resulted in an increase in our net periodic pension and postretirement costs 
we increased the discount rate by basis points and we reduced our expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points 
these assumption changes decreased the service cost and interest cost and reduced the expected return components of our pension and postretirement benefits costs 
pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
during fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees 
the current year contribution achieved a desired level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding requirements while maximizing the tax deductible contribution for this plan for plan year during fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million to the master trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation 
we made the contribution because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our june  measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities 
we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by our regulators 
outlook for fiscal high grade corporate bond yields increased in the period leading up to our june  measurement date 
therefore  we increased the discount rate for determining our fiscal pension and benefit costs by basis points to percent 
however  we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points to percent 
the effect of these assumption changes  coupled with the effects of updating our annual valuation should not significantly affect our fiscal net pension and postretirement costs compared to fiscal we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal  nor  at this time  do we intend to make voluntary contributions during however  we anticipate contributing approximately million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 

table of contents recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments 
in our utility segment  we use a combination of storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper  the issuance of floating rate debt in october and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk utility segment we purchase natural gas for our utility operations 
substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
however  our utility operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our non regulated energy services customers at fixed prices 
for our utility segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixed price non regulated sales 
based on these projected non regulated gas sales  a hypothetical percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september  three month market strip  would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately million in fiscal natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our natural gas marketing segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had less than a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 

table of contents additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
because we recognized risk management liabilities as of september   we placed million in escrow to collateralize these liabilities 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during we also assess market risk for our fixed and floating rate long term obligations 
we estimate market risk for our long term obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease  the fair value of our long term obligations would have increased by approximately million 
as of september   we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
