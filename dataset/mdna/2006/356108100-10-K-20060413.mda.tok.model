executive summary throughout  fred s continued to focus our merchandising and store direction on maintaining a competitive differentiation within the shopping trip 
our unique store format and strategy combine the attractive elements of a discount dollar store  drug store and mass merchant 
in comparison  the discount dollar stores average and chain drugs and mass merchants average in the range of per transaction 
our stores operate equally well in rural and urban markets 
our product selection is enhanced by a private label program and opportunistic buys 
our everyday low pricing strategy is supplemented by promotional circulars per year 
in the fourth quarter  we invested in more aggressive television and radio advertising to help drive sales in our highly competitive markets 
in  the company continued the strategic growth direction to grow its store base 
we opened new stores and new pharmacies in we closed seven stores and three pharmacies during the year 
the majority of the new store and pharmacy openings were in alabama  georgia  texas  and north carolina 
we have now entered into oklahoma with the opening of one new store in the company s selling space increased to million square feet at the end of this year  as compared to million square feet at the end of last year 
a new initiative in was the addition of our new refrigerated foods program  which has added a totally new merchandise category in our stores 
the rollout of the coolers was completed on time and under budget 
this rollout greatly enhanced the convenience of our stores 
the program is seen as a sound traffic generator while lifting our comparable store average customer transaction amount 
stores equipped with the refrigerated foods program accept government assistance cards 
inventory initiatives during resulted in a per store average reduction of year over year 
overall increases in inventory levels related to elevated levels at the distribution centers to support new allocation and sorting programs 
improvements in purchasing and more effective inventory systems have helped to minimize inventory throughout the stores  resulting in better cash flow and inventory turnover and store labor expense leveraging 
at the end of  long term indebtedness was million compared with million at the prior year end  a reduction of million 
inventory turns improved from to times 
in  store labor expense improved by 
over the prior year 
during the year  the company saw continued payback on key technology initiatives we implemented 
these initiatives include store point of sale systems upgrades  allocation system upgrades  and radio frequency devices in the stores to facilitate scanning in store deliveries and correct inventory counts 
in  while the company made important strides internally on productivity initiatives  the external economic environment in which we operate was very challenging 
we experienced a continued product mix shift toward basic and 
table of contents consumable products because customers changed their shopping habits as they adapted to reduced discretionary income due to rising energy costs 
the pharmacy department business was affected by two key events 
on august   the state of tennessee initiated significant cuts to its tenncare medicaid program  eliminating approximately  recipients and reducing the allowed prescriptions for all other enrollees from an unlimited number to just five per month 
this action has had a dramatic impact on the pharmacy sales of our almost stores in the state 
the impact of this sales loss to earnings was approximately two cents per diluted share in each of the third and fourth quarters 
on january  the medicare part d program  which impacts eligible seniors and disabled customers  became effective which required those covered by medicaid programs to move to that new  lower margin program 
the movement of prescriptions transferred was greater than expected and reduced earnings by an additional one cent post tax per diluted share in the fourth quarter 
additionally  in hurricanes katrina and rita impacted the gulf coast  affecting a large part of our service area 
the storms caused the temporary closure of up to stores for up to days at the peak of hurricane katrina  and resulted in the complete destruction of stores 
the most significant losses caused by the storms were inventory and fixed assets  in the form of store fixtures and improvements 
these losses were partially offset by insurance proceeds  and the company expects to record additional insurance proceeds as they are received 
while business interruption was experienced during the storms  the company did not receive and did not record any business interruption insurance proceeds as revenue and will not do so until the business interruption claims are substantially settled 
in  the company plans to open new stores and new pharmacies  with the net effect being an increase in selling space in the range of to 
increased selling space will help drive increases in total sales  while comparable store sales increases will be driven by our continued focus on merchandising  with initiatives such as our merchandise refresher program 
additionally  our newly implemented cooler program will continue to drive increases in comparable store sales 
the company will continue in with capital investment in infrastructure  including new store expansion  distribution center upgrades and further development of our information technology capabilities 
key factors that will be critical to the company s future success include managing the growth strategy for new stores and pharmacies  including the ability to open and operate effectively  maintain high standards of customer service  maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  and increasing the operating margin through improved gross profit margin and leveraging operating costs  and generating the adequate cash flow to fund the company s expansion 
in  other factors that will affect company performance include the managing the impacts of the implementation of medicare part d which has a negative effect on gross margin with a partial positive offset from increasing part d scripts  implementation of the federally approved change in pricing of generic pharmaceuticals to average manufacturer s price amp which could negatively affect gross margin and the implementation of financial accounting standard no r  share based payments which increases compensation expense

critical accounting policies 
table of contents the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements and the most critical accounting policies are as follows inventories 
warehouse inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the fifo first in  first out method 
retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method rim 
under rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
also  it is recognized that the use of the rim will result in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markups  markdowns  and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate cost figures 
based upon our historical information we have not experienced any significant change in our cost valuation for the years and management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which are approximately million and million at january  and january   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the rim method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at january  and million at january  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million  million  and million  during   and  respectively 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement  whichever is lesser 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years 
table of contents assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed the estimated lives of certain store fixtures from five to ten years 
based on the company s historical experience  ten years is a closer approximation of the actual lives of these assets 
the change in estimate was applied prospectively 
expenses for the fourth quarter of were favorably impacted by approximately million pretax 
per diluted share as a result of this change 
expenses for were favorably impacted by approximately million pretax 
per diluted share as a result of this change 
vendor rebates 
the company receives vendor rebates for achieving certain purchase or sales volume and receives vendor allowances to fund certain expenses 
the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf is effective for arrangements with vendors initiated on or after january  eitf addresses the accounting and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor s products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor s products 
the eitf concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold  unless specific criteria are met qualifying the consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific  identifiable incremental costs 
the provisions of this consensus have been applied prospectively 
during the quarter ended october   the company renewed its contract with its primary pharmaceutical wholesaler  amerisourcebergen corporation 
as noted in prior public filings  the renewal of this contract would  and did impact the company s financial statements because of the application of the provisions of eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
the effect on the financial statements  which occurred during the third quarter  was a deferral of the associated rebates against cost of sales of million pretax estimated at per diluted share  after tax 
this change in timing had no effect on cash flow for the quarter 
while the contract was not due to mature until january   the renewal terms were positive to overall earnings and will benefit the company through better pricing 
for vendor funding arrangements that were entered into prior to december  and have not been modified subsequently  the company recognizes a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses or cost of goods sold when earned 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on known claims and estimates for future claims cost and incurred but not reported claims 
estimates for future claims costs would include costs and other factors such as the type of injury or claim  required services by providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claim  and governmental regulations 
if future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns  the company may be required to record additional expense or expense reductions which could be material to the company s results of operations 
additional insurance coverage exists for excessive or catastrophic claims 

table of contents stock based compensation 
the company grants stock options having a fixed number of shares and an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant to certain executive officers  directors and key employees 
through january  the company had accounted for stock option grants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is generally not recognized for plans in which the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and the number of shares subject to exercise is fixed 
had compensation cost for the company s stock based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
 net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table in thousands  except per share amounts net income as reported less pro forma effect of stock option grants pro forma basic earnings per share as reported pro forma diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
the fasb concluded that companies can adopt the new standard in one of two ways the modified prospective transition method  in which the company would recognize share based employee compensation from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the effective date and to any awards that were not fully vested as of the effective date  or the modified retrospective transition method  in which a company would recognize employee compensation cost for periods presented prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  pursuant to which a company would recognize employee compensation cost in the amounts reported in the pro forma disclosures provided in accordance with sfas no 
the company will adopt sfas no 
r during the first quarter of fiscal and will use the modified prospective transition method 
the company also periodically awards restricted stock having a fixed number of shares at a purchase price that is set by the compensation committee of the company s board of directors  which purchase price may be set at zero  to certain executive officers  directors and key employees 
the company also accounts for restricted stock grants in accordance with apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 the company calculates compensation expense as the difference between the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and the purchase price  if any  and recognizes such amount on a straight line basis over the period in which the restricted stock award is earned by the recipient 
the company recognized compensation expense relating to its
