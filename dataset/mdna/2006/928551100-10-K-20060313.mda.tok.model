the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included in item of part ii of this form k 
overview vivus  inc is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products to restore sexual function in women and men 
our product pipeline includes four clinical stage product candidates  each of which targets an estimated existing or potential market in excess of billion annually 
evamist  currently in phase development  is our product candidate to alleviate symptoms associated with menopause 
avanafil  which recently completed phase trials  is our phosphodiesterase type  or pde  inhibitor product candidate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
alista  currently in phase b trials  is our product candidate for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder 
testosterone mdts  which recently completed a positive phase trial  is our product candidate to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder 
in  we launched muse alprostadil in the united states and  together with our partners in  internationally 
we market muse as a prescription product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
for international markets  we have entered into supply and distribution agreements with established pharmaceutical companies to market and distribute muse in various foreign countries 
muse was the first minimally invasive therapy for erectile dysfunction available at a time when only more invasive therapies existed 
developing and bringing muse to the market provided us with experience in clinical and regulatory matters when the market for erectile dysfunction was in its infancy 
we have funded operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and through product sales 
we expect to generate future net losses due to increases in operating expenses as product candidates are advanced through the various stages of clinical development 
as of december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of million and expect to incur operating losses in the near future 
our product pipeline we currently have four research and development programs targeting female and male sexual health product indication status patent expiry and number evamist estradiol mdts menopausal symptoms phase ongoing us  alista topical alprostadil female sexual arousal disorder fsad phase b ongoing us  testosterone mdts hypoactive sexual desire disorder hsdd phase completed us  avanafil pde inhibitor erectile dysfunction ed phase completed us  our corporate strategy our goal is to become a leader in the development and commercialization of innovative proprietary products for the treatment of female and male sexual health 
we intend to achieve this by capitalizing on our clinical and regulatory expertise and experience in the field of sexual health to advance the development of product candidates in our pipeline  establishing strategic relationships with marketing partners to maximize sales potential for our products that require significant commercial support  and licensing complementary clinical stage products or technologies with competitive advantages from third parties for new and established markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  rebates and sales reserves  research and development expenses  doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventories and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product returns we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information and data obtained from external sources 
we record reserves for anticipated returns of expired or damaged product in the united states 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of product returns can be made based on historical experience 
revisions in returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
there is no right of return on product sold internationally subsequent to shipment  thus  no returns reserve is needed 
we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust the reserves accordingly 
for example  in the quarter ended june   we reduced our product returns reserve by  based on a decrease in historical returns experience 
if actual product returns are greater than our estimates  additional reserves may be required 
rebates and sales reserves we have estimated reserves for government chargebacks for goods purchased by certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  medicaid rebates to states for goods purchased by patients covered by medicaid  other rebate programs and cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information and data obtained from external sources 
in estimating government chargeback reserves  we analyze actual chargeback amounts and apply historical chargeback rates to estimates of the quantity of units sold subject to chargebacks 
in estimating medicaid and other rebates  the historical rebate percentage is used to estimate future rebates 
effective january   muse will no longer qualify for medicaid reimbursement  which we do not believe will have a significant impact on our business 
for qualified customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
allowances for cash discounts are estimated based upon the amount of trade accounts receivable subject to the cash discounts 
we routinely assess our experience with cash discounts  medicaid and other rebates and government chargebacks and adjust the reserves accordingly 
if actual government chargebacks  medicaid rebates  rebate and cash discounts are greater than our estimates  additional reserves may be required 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses include license fees  related compensation  contractor fees  facilities costs  administrative expenses and clinical trials at other companies and research institutions under agreements which are generally cancelable  among other related r d costs 
all such costs are charged to r d expense as incurred 
we review and accrue clinical trials and other r d expense based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on patient enrollment  completion of studies and other events 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a research agreement or clinical trial can be made 
accrued clinical costs and other r d expenses are subject to revisions as work progresses to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for all periods presented  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we have also recorded income taxes payable for estimated current tax liabilities 
we monitor these estimated liabilities and adjust them as conditions warrant 
restructuring in  we experienced a significant restructuring and recorded restructuring related reserves for severance and employee costs  inventory obsolescence  raw material purchase commitments  property and related commitments  marketing commitments and other commitments 
we monitor the adequacy of these liabilities and have made periodic adjustments as conditions have changed 
on december   we purchased from our landlord our principal manufacturing facility  which was previously leased  for million 
the purchase price was funded in part by million  which was being held by the landlord as cash collateral for renovations to the facility upon the termination of the lease and the remainder with cash 
as a result  the million restructuring reserve  which was related to the restoration liability on this facility  was eliminated and recorded as an adjustment against the purchase price of the building in december inventories we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during the quarter ended september   we established significant reserves against our inventory to align with new estimates of expected future demand for muse 
vivus had built up its inventory level prior to and after the launch of viagra and had not anticipated the impact that viagra would have on the demand for muse 
as of december   the remaining inventory reserve balance is million relating to raw materials and components 
some portion of the fully reserved inventory was used in production in  and in the fourth quarter of  we stopped using the fully reserved raw materials inventory in production and determined that we would not likely use this inventory in future production 
in the first quarter of  we determined that we likely would continue to use some portion of the fully reserved component parts in production 
to the extent that this fully reserved inventory was used in production in  and  it was charged to cost of goods sold at a zero basis  which had a favorable impact on cost of goods sold 
available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt securities that are stated at fair value 
we restrict our cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p or better 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts which are recognized as adjustments to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
our policy is to record investments in debt securities as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
any gains and losses on the sale of debt securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
available for sale securities with original maturities beyond one year from the balance sheet date are classified as non current 
contingencies and litigation we are periodically involved in disputes and litigation related to a variety of matters 
when it is probable that we will experience a loss  and that loss is quantifiable  we record appropriate reserves 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or net loss per share  during the same period in the increased net loss in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to lower product revenues both in the united states and internationally offset by lower research and development costs in as compared to for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or net loss per share as compared to a net loss of  or no net loss per share  during the same period in the net loss was higher in as compared to primarily due to lower product sales of muse in the united states and internationally and higher research and development expenses including an aggregate million in one time charges for licensing and milestone payments associated with three of our development programs  increased clinical trial and project activity for alista  avanafil  evamist and testosterone mdts  as well as the lack of the million in other revenue resulting from the settlement of the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration claim 
we anticipate continued losses over the next several years because we expect muse sales to remain constant  and we plan to continue to invest in clinical development of our current research and development product candidates to bring those potential products to market 
revenue in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change increase decrease united states product  net international product other revenue total revenues worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in product revenue in the united states for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  international product revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period last year 
domestic sales of muse were lower in the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  mainly due to destocking of inventory at the wholesale level that occurred prior to the fourth quarter of  a decline in the demand for muse  decreased purchases made by wholesalers in advance of the december price increase as compared to purchases in advance of the december price increase  and new us government pricing which results in higher chargebacks 
similar to prior years  wholesalers made purchases in the fourth quarter that were greater than demand 
based on the fourth quarter demand for muse  we estimate purchases made by wholesalers in the fourth quarter of represent approximately four months of excess demand 
as a result of the fourth quarter purchases by wholesalers  we expect our sales in the first half of will be reduced as experienced in the first half of and demand for muse  as measured by independent third party prescription data  has begun to stabilize but is down from the demand in international revenue also decreased as a result of lower shipments of muse to our international distribution partners in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  however  of the shipments made in to our international partners took place in the fourth quarter of product revenue from the sales of muse in the united states for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  a decrease of million 
international product revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to worldwide product revenues from the sales of muse were million in  a decrease of million  or  from the worldwide sales of muse in the change in revenues was mainly due to decreased demand for muse 
the launch of new pde inhibitors and the associated direct to consumer advertising and aggressive sampling opportunities for all pde inhibitors contributed to the decline in demand for muse 
in addition  based on the fourth quarter demand for muse  as measured by independent third party prescription data  we estimate purchases made by wholesalers ahead of our annual price increase in the fourth quarter of  represented approximately months of excess demand 
given the stabilization of demand and the strategic buying in the fourth quarter of  we anticipate worldwide revenues of muse in will remain consistent with those seen in cost of goods sold and manufacturing 
in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change increase decrease cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold and manufacturing cost of goods sold in the year ended december  decreased  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we expensed approximately million of manufacturing overhead costs in the year ended december   as compared to million during the same period in as period costs because of excess manufacturing capacity at our new jersey facility 
this accounting treatment is based on the determination made during the restructuring that the manufacturing capacity of the new jersey plant far exceeds the level of production required to meet estimated future market demand 
additionally  in accordance with gaap  in we reduced the carrying cost of alprostadil  the active ingredient in muse  and its component parts to zero due to excess quantities on hand at that time 
although the cost basis for alprostadil was reduced to zero  we continued to use this active ingredient as allowed by the fda in the production of muse in by utilizing the inventory that had previously been written down to zero  we lowered our cost of sales for the year ended december  by  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that we would likely not use the fully reserved raw materials inventory in future production 
in the year ended december   we used component parts of this fully reserved inventory resulting in a favorable impact on our cost of goods sold of  we anticipate that cost of goods sold in will remain consistent with costs 
cost of goods sold for was million  as compared to million for  an increase of  as mentioned above  in  we reduced the carrying cost of alprostadil  the active ingredient in muse  to zero due to excess quantities on hand at that time 
we lowered our cost of sales for and by  and million  respectively  by utilizing this previously written down inventory 
the increase in cost of goods sold in as compared to was primarily due to use of recently purchased alprostadil that was expensed at its full cost of acquisition 
research and development 
in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change increase decrease research and development research and development expenses in the year ended december  were million  as compared to million in the year ended december  increased clinical trial and project activity for alista and evamist resulted in incremental spending for these projects of million in the year ended december   as compared to the same period last year 
this increase was more than offset by a decrease of million in avanafil  testosterone mdts and other related clinical trial and project spending  a decrease of million in non project related research and development expenses  primarily lower compensation expense due to reduced headcount  and million in milestone and licensing fees which were incurred in during  we entered into exclusive licensing agreements with a subsidiary of acrux under which we will develop and commercialize  in the united states  an estradiol spray now known as evamist for the alleviation of the symptoms of menopause and a testosterone spray for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women 
during the year ended december   we expensed a total of million of licensing fees incurred under the terms of the agreements 
in addition  during the year ended december   we initiated a phase clinical trial with avanafil  which we completed in under the terms of our development  licensing and supply agreement with tanabe  we expensed a million licensing fee obligation to tanabe in the year ended december  we intend to pay the entire obligation to tanabe  totaling million with imputed interest  in march research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  as compared to million for the same period in during  we expensed a total million of licensing fees under the terms of the exclusive licensing agreements with a subsidiary of acrux mentioned above 
in addition  under the terms of our development  licensing and supply agreement with tanabe  we expensed a million milestone obligation to tanabe in the expenses associated with the avanafil phase clinical trials in resulted in an additional million expense 
increased clinical trial and project activity for alista  evamist and testosterone mdts resulted in incremental spending for these projects of million during as compared to additionally  salary  benefit and consulting expenses increased in support of our ongoing projects 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease in  however  based upon results of clinical trails or other new information  results of obtaining additional funding or as a result of entering into a collaborative arrangement  we may decide to increase research and development expenses at any time to pursue additional projects or studies 
we do not expect to recognize revenue from sales of any new product candidates being developed through our research and development efforts for several years 
selling  general and administrative 
in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change increase selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in the twelve months ended december  of million were  higher than the same period last year due to several factors 
in the first quarter of  two of our largest wholesalers commenced charging us a distribution service fee based upon either the quantity of product purchased or sold by the respective wholesaler 
we recorded expense of  for this distribution service fee in the year ended december  to selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect that these distribution service fees will continue into the future 
in addition  we recorded  of incremental accounting and audit fees expense and  in other professional consulting fees in the year ended december  primarily related to compliance with the requirements of sarbanes oxley 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in muse advertising and promotion related expenses in the twelve months ended december  as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses for were million as compared to million for  a million increase 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in spending for investor and public relations activities and marketing programs  as well as the absence of the reimbursement of previously incurred legal fees and other expenses related to the settlement of the janssen pharmaceutica arbitration claim in the third quarter of we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in due to sales and marketing efforts related to muse 
interest income and expense 
interest income for was million  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in our cash balances and related investment yields from the year ended december  to december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  during the same period last year 
this interest expense is related to the acrux milestone liabilities and tanabe license fees and loan 
the increased interest expense is primarily due to a higher loan balance outstanding for the tanabe loan 
interest income for was  as compared to  for declining balances of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities contributed to the reduction in interest income 
interest expense of  in was related to the acrux and tanabe milestone liabilities 
we did not have any interest expense in liquidity and capital resources cash 
unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the use of cash for operations and the purchase of our principal manufacturing facility  which was previously leased  partially offset by the march  sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which provided us with net proceeds of million 
since inception  we have financed operations primarily from the issuance of equity securities and revenues 
through december   we raised million from financing activities and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  available for sale securities 
we focus on liquidity and capital preservation in our investments in available for sale securities 
we restrict our cash investments to direct obligations of the united states treasury  federal agency securities which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  and corporate securities  including commercial paper  rated a p or better 
the weighted average maturity of our portfolio is not to exceed months 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million  as compared to million at december  the decrease in the accounts receivable balance at december  is primarily due to decreased revenue and therefore receivables in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in currently  we do not have any significant concerns related to accounts receivable or collections 
as of february   we had collected of the december  accounts receivable 
liabilities 
total liabilities were million at december    lower than at december  the change in total liabilities is primarily due to the elimination of the million accrued restructuring reserve as a result of our december  purchase of our previously leased manufacturing facilities in lakewood  new jersey partially offset by a million increase in notes payable due to increased borrowings on the tanabe line of credit 
we have entered into manufacturing agreements with suppliers to purchase raw materials 
as of december   our remaining commitment under these agreements is to purchase a minimum of million of product from through should our inventory of raw materials exceed our future production needs  it may be necessary to write off any excess inventory 
operating activities 
our operating activities used and million of cash during the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   our net operating loss of million was partially offset by a million reduction in our accounts receivable  due to the collection of monies owed to us  and non cash depreciation expense of million 
the cash used in can be attributed to our net operating loss of million and a million increase in our accounts receivable balance  partially offset by million in increased accrued research  clinical and licensing fees primarily due to million related to the future payment of milestone and licensing fees to acrux and tanabe  and million in non cash depreciation expense 
investing activities 
our investing activities provided million and million in cash during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations from period to period are due primarily to the timing of purchases  sales and maturity of investment securities and the purchase of land and buildings for million offset by the release of restricted cash of million in financing activities 
financing activities provided cash of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts include the proceeds from the march  sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  providing us with net proceeds of million in the year ended december   as well as the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  employee stock purchase plan espp purchases and borrowings under note arrangements in the year ended december  and in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement for a line of credit with tanabe  allowing us to borrow up to million to be used for the development of avanafil 
the secured line of credit may be drawn upon quarterly and each quarterly borrowing will have a month term and will bear interest at the annual rate of 
as of december   we had a long term notes payable balance of million and million remaining available on the credit line 
we borrowed an additional million under this credit line during on december   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  which allows us to offer and sell up to an aggregate of million of common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the terms of any such future offering would be established at the time of such offering 
on february   we filed a prospectus supplement with the sec relating to an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock under the existing shelf registration statement and supplement thereto 
on march   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  providing us with net proceeds of million 
on december   we purchased from our landlord our principal manufacturing facility  which was previously leased  for million 
the purchase price was funded in part by million  which was being held by the landlord as cash collateral for renovations to the facility upon the termination of the lease and the remainder with cash 
on january   we obtained a million loan from crown bank  na crown  secured by the land and buildings  among other assets  located at our principal manufacturing facility and a  certificate of deposit held by crown 
the loan is payable over a year term and the interest rate will be fixed at  which is the prime rate plus at the time of funding and then will be adjusted annually to a fixed rate for the year equal to the prime rate plus with a floor of 
the funding necessary to execute our business strategies is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is also important to note that if a clinical candidate is identified  the further development of that candidate can be halted or abandoned at any time due to a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  funding constraints  lack of efficacy or safety or change in market demand 
the nature and efforts required to develop our product candidates into commercially viable products include research to identify a clinical candidate  preclinical development  clinical testing  fda approval and commercialization 
this process is very costly and can take in excess of years to complete for each product candidate 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical studies  including  among others  the following we or the fda may suspend trials  we may discover that a product candidate may cause harmful side effects or is not effective  patient recruitment may be slower than expected  and patients may drop out of the trials 
for each of our programs  we periodically assess the scientific progress and the merits of the programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and lack of prospects for ultimate commercialization 
as such  the ultimate timeline and costs to commercialize a product cannot be accurately estimated 
our product candidates have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results in later clinical trials 
it is possible for a candidate to show promising results in clinical trails  but subsequently fail to establish safety and efficacy data necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we may also be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other areas of our business 
in particular our future capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and costs of our research and development programs  the scope  timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  patient recruitment and enrollment in current and future clinical trials  the costs involved in seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the costs involved in filing and pursuing patent applications and enforcing patent claims  the establishment of collaborations and strategic alliances  the cost of manufacturing and commercialization activities and arrangements  the results of operations  demand for muse  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  ongoing determinations of the potential commercial success of our products under development  the level of resources devoted to sales and marketing capabilities  and the activities of competitors 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources combined with anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to support our operating needs into however  we anticipate that we will require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  to conduct preclinical studies and trials  for operating expenses  to pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending our patent claims  if any  and we may require additional funding to establish additional manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
in particular  we expect to make other substantial payments to acrux and tanabe in accordance with our agreements with them in connection with the licensing of certain compounds 
these payments are based on certain development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in addition  we are required to make royalty payments on any future product sales 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
the sale of additional equity securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms 
we cannot assure you that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others 
this may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates 
to the extent that we are unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  we expect that increased expenses will result in increased losses from operations 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop our products under development or that our products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable us to earn a profit 
overview of contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchases notes payable other long term liabilities total we purchased our previously leased manufacturing facilities in lakewood  new jersey on december  in january  we entered into a seven year lease for our corporate headquarters in mountain view  california  which expires in january in november  we entered into a manufacturing agreement to purchase raw materials from a supplier beginning in and ending in our remaining commitment under this agreement is to purchase a minimum total of million of product from through in  we purchased  of product  and in we purchased  of product from this supplier 
in january  we entered into a manufacturing agreement to purchase raw materials from an additional supplier beginning in and ending in in february  we amended the terms of this agreement to require the purchase of a minimum total of million of product from through in we purchased  of product and in  we purchased  of product 
in the first quarter of  we signed an agreement for a secured line of credit with tanabe  allowing us to borrow up to million to be used for the development of avanafil 
the secured line of credit may be drawn upon quarterly and each quarterly borrowing will have a month term and will bear interest at the annual rate of 
there are no financial covenants associated with this secured line of credit 
under certain conditions  at our option  payments on this secured line of credit may be made  in whole or in part  in common stock 
as of december   we have million of available credit under this agreement 
other long term liabilities includes million for a licensing fee obligation  due under the terms of our development  licensing and supply agreement with tanabe related to a phase clinical trial with avanafil initiated in the first quarter of and completed in we intend to pay this obligation in march recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement is meant to eliminate any differences existing between the fasb standards and the standards issued by the international accounting standards board by clarifying that any abnormal idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges 
this statement is required to be adopted by vivus in the first quarter of  however  early application is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or cash flows as we currently do expense a portion of our manufacturing overhead as period cost due to excess capacity 
in december  the fasb issued revised statement no 
fas r  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
in april  the sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amended the compliance dates for fas r 
the accounting provisions of fas r will now be effective for the first quarter of fiscal we will adopt the provisions of fas r using a modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  fas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
further compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under fas the impact of the adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will be depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under fas r is similar to fas  with minor exceptions 
the impact on the results of operations and earnings per share had vivus adopted fas  is described in the stock option plans section of note to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r s fair value method will have a material impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
fas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature
