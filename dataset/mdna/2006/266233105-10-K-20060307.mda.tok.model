we also report an all other category to include our other subsidiaries below the quantitative threshold for disclosure 
these subsidiaries provide corporate administrative functions  financing  and insurance services for our various affiliates 
note to the consolidated financial statements shows the financial results of each principal business segment in tabular form 
following is a discussion of these results 
electricity delivery business 
in our continued effort to provide a stable  reliable source of electric energy for our customers  we have embarked on a significant investment program to upgrade both our transmission infrastructure and our distribution infrastructure 
capital expenditures related to the program were approximately million in and we expect to spend an additional to million through the cost of these infrastructure investments is to be funded through operating cash flows  equity infusions from holdings  bank debt and the possible sale of low cost pollution control revenue bonds pcrbs in as part of our overall financing plan 
in addition  effective january  we successfully integrated our transmission operations into those of pjm as a part of our commitment to ensuring reliability 

table of contents the net income from our regulated electricity delivery business was lower in  as expected  due to higher operating costs related to customer assistance programs  increased labor costs and the realignment of certain revenues and expenses related to ancillary energy services that are now reflected in our supply segment 
these changes more than offset the increased revenue generated from favorable weather conditions during in we expect to file a distribution rate case with the puc and a transmission rate case with the ferc to recover our increased costs of service and to receive a fair return on our investments 
duquesne light last filed such rate cases in supply business 
the factors impacting the duquesne light supply business segment have significantly changed when compared to prior periods 
from the time that duquesne light sold its generation assets in april through december   the default energy supply requirement for all customers had been met through a full requirements contract with one supplier 
from the time that duquesne light completed its stranded cost recovery different by each rate class  but generally during the to time period through december   duquesne light had earned a margin on each megawatt hour mwh supplied 
effective january   residential and small commercial customers remaining on polr service saw an average increase of above their polr ii generation rates  reflecting the increase in market energy prices in the time since the polr ii rates were established 
despite this increase in rates  residential and small commercial customer retention has increased to in from in also effective january   duquesne light has been meeting its polr iii energy supply requirements for residential and small commercial customers through duquesne power s portfolio of energy and capacity supply contracts with multiple investment grade counter parties as well as through transactions with pjm 
this change in energy supply strategy is designed to provide the opportunity to earn a larger margin in the supply business 
while taking on increased commodity price risk  we have decreased our supplier credit default risk 
the increased commodity price risk has been managed at a prudent level through the portfolio of energy commodity contracts 
because some of these contracts are not settled at the duquesne light zone  the normal exemption is not applicable and they are accounted for on a mark to market basis  with changes in the fair value of these contracts recorded currently in earnings unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met 
during the year ended december   earnings were positively impacted by a million after tax increase in the fair value of mark to market derivative energy contracts  whose duration varies  but extends no later than december  while it is impossible to determine how the value of these contracts will change during and  the fair value of these contracts will be zero by the latest expiration date of december  contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges differ from those accounted for as mark to market  in that the fair value of these contracts is generally not recognized currently in earnings  but rather as the contracts are settled 
while previously duquesne light s margin on residential and small commercial customers was a fixed dollar amount per mwh  beginning in the margin has an element of seasonality 
revenues per mwh  while fixed on an annual basis through  are lowest in the first and fourth quarters reflecting the discount rate offered to electric heating customers in the november through april heating season 
the revenues per mwh are then higher in the remaining months 
similarly  costs per mwh are expected to have a seasonal element  being higher in the first and third quarters reflecting the peak energy consumption in the heating and cooling seasons 
as a result  margins on residential and small commercial customer energy supply are anticipated to be higher in the second and fourth quarters 
for large business customers  effective january   the polr energy supply product is a fluctuating hourly priced service 
additionally  through may   duquesne light offers a fixed price service whose rate reflects the results of a competitive wholesale request for proposal 
in january  duquesne light requested and received approval from the puc to extend the fixed price service offering for an additional year 
this offering will be subject to the results of another competitive wholesale request for proposal to be conducted 
duquesne light continues to meet its polr energy supply requirement for large customers through interactions with pjm and with full requirements contracts  now with two investment grade suppliers 
because of the uncertainty inherent in hourly priced polr service and the increase in the fixed price rates  polr retention for large commercial and industrial customers has decreased from in to in as of december   the polr retention rate for large commercial and industrial customers was less than  and is expected to remain at approximately this level throughout 
table of contents under the polr ii arrangement that ended december   duquesne light earned a margin on each mwh sold to its large commercial and industrial customers 
during the twelve months ended december   duquesne light earned net income of million in the supply business related to sales to its large commercial and industrial customers 
under the polr iii arrangement that became effective january   duquesne light no longer earns a margin in the supply business on these sales 
in response to the change in large customer polr service  dle has begun to offer competitive electric generation egs service to customers in the duquesne light service territory 
duquesne power manages the dle supply requirements together with the duquesne light residential and small commercial customer polr iii supply requirements 
supply business realignment 
effective december   duquesne power was transferred from duquesne light to another holdings subsidiary 
the operations of duquesne power will only be reported as part of the holdings electricity supply segment beginning january  the transfer of duquesne power was completed to strategically align our unregulated businesses outside of duquesne light in order to provide flexibility to capitalize on future supply opportunities 
the transfer will effectively eliminate the net income included in duquesne light s supply segment 
if this transfer had taken place on january   the net effect to duquesne light s earnings would have been an increase of million in and million in earnings in would have decreased million 
in  duquesne power was just being formed and had minimal activity 
the increase would have been caused by a decrease in other operating and maintenance expense 
the increase would have been caused by the removal of the acquisition termination cost associated with the cancelled sunbury acquisition and other costs 
the decrease would have been caused primarily by the removal of some revenue and an increase in operating expenses  the effect of which would eliminate duquesne power s margin on its sales to duquesne light and dle 
changes to the balance sheets would have been immaterial in and there would be no change to the balance sheet as the transfer took place at close of business on december  landfill gas business 
our landfill gas business a part of our financial business segment is comprised of investments in landfill sites around the country and the ownership of waste energy technologies  llc wet  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of wet has provided landfill gas collection system engineering  design and construction services to the landfill business for over years 
our sites are comprised of three that currently produce pipeline quality gas sold at market rates  five sites where unprocessed landfill gas production is currently sold at significantly lower unit prices than pipeline quality gas  but due to lower operating costs and capital requirements  still provide the opportunity to earn modest returns  and passive investment sites we do not project to be involved with beyond due to the scheduled expiration of section tax credits 
we have made small  strategic capital investments to maximize our existing production capacities and improve the throughput of the landfill gas processing sites we expect to continue to operate  and have focused our efforts to streamline and minimize our operating costs 
these sites also have sufficient quantities of available gas to remain viable beyond the expiration of section tax credits on december  we are a significant producer of pipeline quality landfill gas in the united states 
the majority of our earnings from our landfill gas business are derived from the three pipeline quality production sites 
our contract at one of these sites located in new york city is scheduled to terminate on june   our earnings for included million related to this site 
we expect to operate our other two pipeline quality landfill gas sites for approximately more years 
in december  we have also entered into a price swap agreement for approximately of our anticipated pipeline quality landfill gas sales in order to lock in the recent unprecedented increases in natural gas prices 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand this business 
in december  we entered into a joint venture agreement to develop a liquefied natural gas application at one of our five fixed price sites  while at another of these sites we reached agreement for the expansion of our existing gas rights and extended the agreement through we will continue to invest in new landfill gas sites  or expand at existing sites that meet our investment criteria 

table of contents energy solutions business 
the primary operations of this business segment in will be the operation and maintenance of synthetic fuel facilities for a single customer  from which we earn fees based on production 
given that synthetic fuel qualifies for section tax credits  which are set to expire on december   we expect our operation and maintenance of the synthetic fuel facilities to cease at that time 
in addition  section tax credits are subject to a phase out provision that could reduce tax credits if the average annual wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil increases into an inflation adjusted phase out range 
as such  it is possible that operations at these facilities could be curtailed or terminated prior to december  asset divestitures 
we continue to divest businesses that we have determined not to be in line with our core business strategies 
in and our financial business segment sold all or portions of tax advantaged limited partnership investments to generate current cash benefits instead of increasing holdings significant tax credit carryforward position 
we also sold investments in two leveraged lease transactions 
in  our energy solutions business segment entered into agreements to ultimately sell our investments in five energy facility management projects 
we have closed on three of the projects in and anticipate closing the remaining two in early these energy facility management projects did not significantly contribute to the earnings of the energy solutions business segment

duquesne light s earnings available for common stock were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
earnings from duquesne light s supply business segment increased million from the prior year  primarily as a result of a million after tax increase in earnings resulting from certain changes in the fair value of the derivative energy contracts at duquesne power since december   and a million after tax charge included in the results related to the termination of the acquisition of the sunbury generation station 
earnings from the electricity delivery business segment decreased million from the prior year  primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses  which includes million of additional after tax administrative expenses previously borne by holdings prior to the sale of several non complementary businesses 
earnings from continuing operations at holdings were also affected by the following des earnings increased million  primarily as a result of million in after tax gains on the sale of investments in three energy facility management projects during  partially offset by million of charges related to another energy facility management project

our earnings from continuing operations available for common stock were million  or basic earnings per share  in  compared to million  or basic earnings per share  in duquesne light s earnings available for common stock were million in  compared to million in the million decrease in earnings at duquesne light is primarily due to the million after tax charge for the write off of deposits and deferred costs related to the termination of the sunbury acquisition 

table of contents earnings from continuing operations at holdings were also affected by the following earnings from dqe financial decreased million from  primarily due to a million decrease in earnings from structured lease investments primarily as a result of the irs settlement and a million after tax gain  recognized in  on the sale of an investment in a natural gas operating partnership 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in earnings related to our landfill gas business

earnings from dqe communications increased million primarily due to revenue growth from new and existing customers 
the loss from discontinued operations was million  or zero basic earnings per share  compared to income of million  or basic earnings per share  in the income included a million tax benefit related to the use of capital losses generated in connection with the sale of the aquasource subsidiaries and an million after tax gain related to the increase in fair value of aquasource s investor owned utilities as a result of the sale of these utilities to aqua america  inc see note results of operations by business segment compared to electricity delivery business segment 
this segment reported million of earnings in  compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to increased operating expenses in operating revenues are primarily derived from the delivery of electricity  including related excise taxes 
sales to residential and commercial customers are primarily influenced by weather conditions 
warmer summer and colder winter seasons lead to increased customer use of electricity for cooling and heating 
commercial sales also are affected by regional development 
sales to industrial customers are influenced by national and global economic and competitive conditions 
the following table sets forth the mwh delivered to electric utility customers 
mwh delivered in thousands change residential commercial industrial operating revenues decreased million  or  compared to the decrease was primarily due to ancillary services revenue being reported in the duquesne light supply segment in this reclassification of ancillary revenue million in offset the million of revenue collected in to recover seca charges 
it also offset the increased delivery revenues to residential and commercial customers resulting from the higher megawatt hour mwh sales in due to the warmer summer weather as compared to operating expenses consist primarily of costs of operation and maintenance of the transmission systems and distribution systems  meter reading  billing and collection  customer service  administrative expenses  and non income taxes such as gross receipts  property and payroll taxes 
operating expenses increased million  or  compared to following the sale of several of holding s non complementary businesses  approximately million of additional costs were borne by this segment in compared to included in this amount was million related to insurance 
rising energy prices in placed a strain on the budgets of the elderly and low income customers 
duquesne light attempted to balance this impact with sound business practices through increased participation in customer assistance programs 
this had the effect of a million increase in uncollectible accounts expense 
in addition  million of increased labor costs were incurred in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the costs of ancillary services  because the majority of this cost is now being reported in the duquesne light supply segment as a result of the polr iii arrangement 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation on property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangibles 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  compared to the increase was primarily due to million of amortization expense recognized in relating to seca  as discussed in the revenue section above 

table of contents dividends on preferred and preference stock reflect the annual payments made to preferred and preference shareholders 
preferred dividends increased million  or  compared to the prior year due to the million of preferred stock issued in april dividends on all issues of duquesne light s preferred stock are included in interest and other charges in the holdings presentation of the electricity delivery business segment 
duquesne light supply business segment 
as previously discussed  the factors impacting this segment in have changed significantly compared to the prior year 
the following table summarizes the earnings from this segment 
earnings in millions change residential and small commercial large commercial and industrial derivative energy contracts acquisition termination cost total earnings under the polr ii arrangement in  the margin on sales to residential and small commercial customers was a fixed dollar amount per mwh supplied  while under the polr iii arrangement in  the margin on these customers is no longer fixed 
the million increase in the earnings from the residential and small commercial customers reflects the higher polr iii rates 
under the polr ii arrangement  duquesne light earned a margin per mwh on sales to large commercial and industrial customers 
however  there is no margin under the polr iii arrangement associated with these customers  which accounts for a million decrease in earnings from in addition  some of the energy contracts entered into by duquesne power are derivative instruments  the accounting for which results in certain changes in the fair value of these contracts being recorded currently in earnings 
as shown above  there was a million increase in earnings in resulting from certain changes in the fair value of these energy contracts since december  the results for included the million after tax charge related to the termination of the sunbury acquisition 
operating revenues are derived primarily from the supply of electricity to polr retail customers 
retail energy requirements fluctuate as the number of customers choosing alternative generation suppliers changes 
energy requirements for residential and commercial customers are also influenced by weather conditions  temperature extremes lead to changes in customer use of electricity for cooling and heating 
commercial energy requirements are also affected by regional economic development 
energy requirements for industrial customers are primarily influenced by national and global economic conditions 
in addition  operating revenues include  to a lesser extent  the supply of electricity to wholesale customers 
beginning in  these sales are primarily comprised of sales to dle by duquesne power under its full requirements energy supply contract 
in  these sales primarily consisted of short term sales to other utilities that were made at market rates  and resulted primarily from excess daily energy deliveries to duquesne light s electricity delivery system

this was augmented by an approximate million increase in retail revenue from increased mwh sales due to the warmer summer weather that occurred in and an increase in the number of customers being served under the polr iii arrangement 
in addition  there was an approximate million increase in wholesale sales of electricity in  due primarily to sales to dle 
as shown in the tables above  there has been a significant decrease in the mwh supplied to large commercial and industrial customers as a higher percentage of these customers chose an alternative generation supplier in this resulted in an approximate million decrease in operating revenues compared to in  operating expenses consisted of i costs to obtain energy and capacity for duquesne light s polr service and to supply dle  ii certain changes in the fair value of derivative energy contracts  iii administrative expenses at duquesne power  and iv gross receipts tax 
in  operating expenses consisted primarily of costs to obtain energy for our polr service and gross receipts tax  both of which fluctuated directly with operating revenues 
beginning in the third quarter of  operating expenses also included administrative expenses at duquesne power

as a result  a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs a regulatory asset if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase in future rates 
accordingly  duquesne light defers certain costs  which will be amortized over future periods 
to the extent that collection of such costs is no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation or competitive position  the associated regulatory assets are charged to expense 
see note unbilled electricity revenues 
holdings and duquesne light record revenues related to the sale of electricity when delivery is made to customers 
however  the determination of such sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which duquesne light reads on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  holdings and duquesne light estimate the amount of electricity delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading based on actual daily meter reads or  alternatively  estimated daily use based on rate specific  statistically estimated  hourly consumption patterns 
unbilled revenues are estimated each month based on the rate class specific unbilled electricity sales and the corresponding average retail rate 
impairment of long lived assets and investments 
we evaluate long lived assets including other intangibles of identifiable business activities and investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  these computations use judgments and assumptions inherent in management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to determine recoverability of the assets 
it is possible that a computation under a held for sale situation for certain of these long lived assets could result in a significantly different assessment because of market conditions  specific transaction terms or a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
for investments  we considered our investee s cash on hand  financing abilities  customers  contracts and overall ability to continue as a going concern 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions 
we provide pension benefit plans covering substantially all of our full time employees 
we also provide postretirement benefits for some retired employees 
the retiree medical benefits terminate when retirees reach age we account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we record amounts related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and health care cost trend rates 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
changes in these assumptions could have a significant effect on our non cash pension income or expense or on our postretirement benefit costs 
the effect of changes in these assumptions is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
we discounted our future pension and other postretirement plan obligations using a rate of as of december   compared to as of december  the discount rate is determined by i considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments and ii using an outside advisor to produce a yield curve model that represents the yields on high quality corporate bonds 
when applied to our projected future benefit payments  this model determines the weighted 
table of contents average discount rate 
both the pension and other postretirement plan obligations and related expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets in the pension plans is the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the type of investments held by the plans 
as the expected rate of return on plan assets increases  the pension plan expense decreases  however the postretirement plan expense is unaffected as this plan has no assets 
for  the assumed rate of return on plan assets in the pension plans was 
we revised this assumption to for both and to more closely align with our actual and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
due to changes in health care costs over recent years  the health care trend assumption used in the development of the fiscal expense will be adjusted to better reflect the current and future cost environment 
the health care trend assumption reflected in the december   sfas no 
year end disclosure  which will also be used in the development of fiscal expense  is  decreasing per year to an ultimate rate of reached in 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on our prior experience  market conditions  and the advice of plan actuaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about these assumptions  actual performance  amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for the past three years 
as of december   the fair value of the pension plan assets of million represented approximately of the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans 
our pension gain for was million and our expected pension cost for is million 
our expense or gain for actual pension benefits in future periods will depend upon actual returns on plan assets and the key assumptions we use for future periods 
we were not required to make cash contributions to our pension plans in  nor will we be required to do so in  due to a sufficient credit balance as determined by actuarial valuations 
in accordance with current funding rules  this credit balance can be applied against the minimum funding requirements 
in january  duquesne light met its obligation  pursuant to the january  puc order regarding duquesne light s final generation asset sale proceeds accounting  by contributing million to the pension plans 
also  in january and february of  duquesne light made aggregate discretionary contributions of million to the pension plans 
income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we use the liability method in computing deferred taxes on all differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these book tax differences occur when events and transactions recognized for financial reporting purposes are not recognized in the same period for tax purposes 
the deferred tax liability or asset is also adjusted in the period of enactment for the effect of changes in tax laws or rates 
our overall effective tax rate is significantly reduced by the income tax credits generated from our synthetic fuel  landfill gas and affordable housing investments 
we file a consolidated us federal income tax return with our subsidiaries  all of whom participate in an intercompany tax sharing arrangement which generally provides that taxable income for each subsidiary be calculated as if it filed a separate return 
duquesne light recognizes a regulatory asset for deferred tax liabilities that are expected to be recovered through rates 
the difference in the provision for deferred income taxes related to depreciation of electric plant in service and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles is deferred and included in regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
see note derivative instruments 
in the normal course of business  we have entered into various contracts to mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in market prices of electricity supply  pipeline quality landfill gas sales and interest rates that are accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
the contracts are in compliance with a board approved risk management policy that permits transactions for the prudent management of market related risks  and precludes any speculative transactions 
the contracts that are determined to fall within the scope of sfas no 
 and that are required to be recorded at fair value  are included as derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value  except those related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  are accounted for using mark to market accounting and are included currently in earnings in 
table of contents each reporting period until the contracts are ultimately settled 
management s expectations and intentions are key factors in determining the appropriate accounting for a derivative instrument  and as a result  such expectations and intentions are formally documented at inception 
management continues to evaluate these initial expectations and intentions as they relate to the underlying contract on an ongoing basis 
cash flow hedge accounting treatment may be used for contracts used to buy or sell a commodity at a fixed price for future delivery corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchases or to lock in current interest rates on existing or planned debt issuances 
fair value hedge accounting may be used to hedge the risk that the fair value of specific assets and liabilities or specific firm commitments may change between inception and anticipated delivery date 
to the extent that the hedge is fully effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact on earnings prior to settlement of the hedge 
in addition  we apply the normal purchases and sales exemption  provided by sfas no 
 to certain contracts 
the normal purchases and sales exemption provides that no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until the settlement of the contract 
the fair values of contracts are estimated through the use of valuation models using quoted market prices  when available 
such estimates require significant judgment as to assumptions and valuation methodologies deemed appropriate by management 
actual future results may vary from those assumptions utilized in the valuation models 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments 
contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when it is management s assessment that a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon management s assumptions and estimates  advice of legal counsel  or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
should additional information become known  or circumstances change with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss indicating that the ultimate outcome will differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be recognized in income in that period 
such contingent liabilities include  but are not limited to  restructuring liabilities see note  income tax matters see note  and other commitments and contingencies see note 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and temporary cash investments increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  duquesne light had a million investment in the dqe capital cash pool at december   exited the cash pool during  and as of december   had cash of million

duquesne light received million from holdings as repayment of an intercompany note during  and exited the dqe capital cash pool 
cash flows from financing activity 
during august  holdings issued million of senior notes due august  and million of senior notes due august  proceeds 
table of contents were used to repay the million intercompany loan with duquesne light and approximately million of variable rate borrowings under holdings credit facility 
the remaining balance was used for general corporate purposes 
as of december   holdings had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
duquesne light used the proceeds received from the repayment of holdings intercompany loan plus available cash to purchase at par upon mandatory tender million of variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds pcrbs with maturity dates ranging from to this purchase was in accordance with sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and is presented on duquesne light s balance sheet as an extinguishment of debt  because duquesne light is the primary obligor of the pcrbs 
duquesne light plans to sell all of the pcrbs at future dates to refinance higher cost securities  fund infrastructure investments  and for general corporate purposes 
holdings paid cash dividends on common and preferred stock of million  million and million in   and these amounts are net of the cash received back from our shareholders who participate in our dividend reinvestment plan 
duquesne light paid cash dividends on common and preferred stock of million  million  and million in  and during  duquesne light embarked on a significant capital expenditure program  and began retaining more of its earnings than in prior years 
also during  holdings contributed million to duquesne light company in support of the capital expenditure program 
financing plan we estimate that for the period from through  duquesne light s capital expenditures will be approximately to million for electric utility construction related to transmission and distribution infrastructure 
during through  holdings is expected to spend approximately million to million  primarily related to investments in the keystone and conemaugh power stations including acquisition costs and landfill gas facilities 
we plan to issue debt and equity securities and to borrow under our credit facilities to provide equity contributions to duquesne light and to fund our investments 
duquesne light plans to use a combination of parent equity contributions  sale of debt securities and credit facility borrowings to fund its capital expenditures and cash needs 
on october   we filed a shelf registration statement for up to million of preferred stock  common stock  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units  warrants and debt securities  to be issued from time to time 
our ability to issue such securities will depend on  among other things  market demand  interest rates  and corporate strategy 
we expect to use a substantial portion of the registered securities during to fund our planned expenditures 
liquidity we believe that cash on hand  access to debt and equity capital markets  and bank borrowing capacity continue to provide sufficient resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements  capital expenditures and investments 
available cash at all subsidiaries  including duquesne light  has historically been deposited in the dqe capital cash pool 
duquesne light s investments in or withdrawals from this cash pool have been reflected as cash flows from investing activities on its consolidated statements of cash flows 
duquesne light began investing its cash outside of the cash pool during the fourth quarter of bank credit facilities 
prior to july  holdings and duquesne light maintained unsecured credit facilities prior revolvers expiring in september  holdings for million and duquesne light for million 
on july  the prior revolvers were amended and extended to july revolvers 
holdings revolver was for million and duquesne light s revolver was for million 
both revolvers permit borrowings at interest rates of libor plus a margin of to or an alternate base rate  as defined in the credit facilities 
both revolvers have commitment fees applicable to the remaining available amount 
interest rates and commitment fees are based on the borrower s then current senior unsecured credit rating 
both revolvers are subject to cross default if the borrower or any of its subsidiaries defaults on any payment due under any indebtedness exceeding million 
undrawn amounts under both revolvers are fully available for the issuance of letters of credit 
under our prior revolvers and revolvers  we are subject to financial covenants requiring each of holdings and duquesne light to maintain a debt

current maturities of long term debt 
none of duquesne light s long term debt is scheduled to mature before the holdings current maturities represent scheduled principal payments on other long term debt 
ratings triggers 
holdings and its subsidiaries do not have material liquidity exposures caused by a ratings downgrade below investment grade that would accelerate the due dates of borrowings or cause collateral to be posted under duquesne power s power purchase agreements 
under one of its surety bond agreements  holdings has a requirement to post letters of credit in the event its debt ratings fall below investment grade 
at december   the letters of credit posting requirement would have been approximately million if our ratings had been below investment grade

rate matters distribution rate case and transmission rate case as a regulated utility  duquesne light may only change its distribution rates or transmission rates by applying  through the rate case process  to the puc or the ferc for approval 
the goal of a rate case is to establish customer rates such that the utility i recovers its costs of providing the service  ii recovers its costs of investing in the transmission and or distribution infrastructure  and iii earns a reasonable and fair return on that investment 
during a rate case  the utility must prove that its proposed rate increase is needed by showing its costs during a given test year 
the utility s costs and expenditures are reviewed and challenged during this process 
a rate case also considers a utility s rate of return on its investment  as well as its costs of financing  in order to derive its annual revenue requirement 
the rates ultimately set are intended to give the utility a reasonable chance to achieve its revenue requirement 
since customer choice was instituted in pennsylvania in  rate caps have prevented recovery of any new investment in transmission and distribution 
the last duquesne light rate case involving transmission and distribution costs dates back to our transmission and distribution rate freeze expired at the end of duquesne light expects to file a request for a distribution rate increase with the puc in march the puc has nine months from the date of the filing to render a decision 
if approved  the new distribution rates are expected to go into effect in january duquesne light cannot predict the amount of the rate increase that will ultimately be approved by the puc 
we also plan to file a transmission rate case with the ferc later in seams elimination charge adjustment see item a 
risk factors  our financial obligations under the seams elimination charge adjustment remain uncertain 
forward looking statements the preceding sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements  the results of which may materially differ from those implied due to known and unknown risks 
table of contents and uncertainties  some of which are discussed below 
cash flow  earnings  earnings growth  capitalization  capital expenditures and dividends will depend on the performance of holdings subsidiaries  and board policy 
demand for and pricing of electricity and landfill gas  changing market conditions  and weather conditions could affect earnings levels 
duquesne light s earnings will be affected by the number of customers who choose to receive electric generation through polr iii  by our ability to negotiate appropriate terms with suitable generation suppliers  and by the performance of these suppliers 
projected polr supply requirements will depend on polr customer retention  which in turn may depend on market generation prices  as well as the marketing efforts of competing generation suppliers 
distribution rate base and earnings will depend on the ultimate structure of our distribution rate case  which in turn will be subject to puc review and approval 
transmission rate base and earnings will depend on the ultimate structure of our transmission rate case  which in turn will be subject to ferc review and approval 
earnings will also be affected by rate base  equity and allowed return levels 
rto rules and ferc mandated transmission charges could affect earnings 
changes in electric energy prices could affect earnings as the fair value of our energy commodity contracts fluctuates 
the amount and timing of any debt reduction or refinancing will depend on the availability of cash flows and appropriate replacement or refinancing vehicles 
the amount and timing of any securities issuance debt or equity will depend on financial market performance and the need for funds 
the credit ratings received from the rating agencies could affect the cost of borrowing  access to capital markets and liquidity 
changes in synthetic fuel plant operations owned by a single customer could affect des earnings 
competition  operating costs and gas prices could affect earnings and expansion plans in our landfill gas business  as well as the anticipated operating life of our landfill gas sites 
earnings with respect to synthetic fuel operations  landfill gas and affordable housing investments will depend  in part  on the continued availability of  and compliance with the requirements for  applicable federal tax credits 
the availability of synthetic fuel and landfill gas tax credits depends in part on the average well head price per barrel of domestic crude oil 
demand for dark fiber will affect dqe communications earnings 
the final resolution of proposed adjustments regarding state income tax liabilities which could depend on negotiations with the appropriate authorities could affect financial position  earnings  and cash flows 
overall performance by holdings and its affiliates could be affected by economic  competitive  regulatory  governmental and technological factors affecting operations  markets  products  services and prices  as well as the factors discussed in holdings sec filings made to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of financial loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
both holdings and duquesne light have potential market risk exposures to interest rate risk and credit default risk 
holdings also faces the risks related to commodity prices and the potential of section tax credit phase out 
holdings and duquesne light have risk management procedures to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and may use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures 
interest rate risk 
currently  neither holdings nor duquesne light have any variable interest rate debt outstanding 
as of december   the variable interest rate debt for holdings and for duquesne light was million  which represented approximately of both holdings and duquesne light s long term debt 
this variable rate debt was low cost  tax exempt debt with an average variable interest rate of for the year ended december  a increase in interest rates would have affected both holdings and duquesne light s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  we manage our interest rate risk by retiring and issuing debt from time to time and by maintaining a range of maturity dates 
a reduction in interest rates would have increased the market value of fixed rate debt by approximately million for holdings and million for duquesne light as of december  and approximately million for both holdings and duquesne light as of december  such changes would not have had a significant near term effect on our future earnings or cash flows 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to commodity price risk arising from market price fluctuations in electricity supply and for sales of pipeline quality landfill gas 
we manage these risks by entering into various fixed price contracts as part of our overall board approved risk management strategy 

table of contents electricity supply 
we mitigate this risk by entering into energy commodity contracts  principally through duquesne power  for anticipated electricity supply obligations within a range of probabilities based on historical customer retention rates and switching trends along with projected forward energy prices 
the energy commodity contracts have primarily been structured to begin and end during the polr iii time period 
the net result of these transactions is that  as of december   duquesne power had secured a substantial portion of the combined expected load obligation for its full requirements contracts with duquesne light and dle 
if duquesne power does not enter into contracts for the remaining portion of its anticipated obligations  it will acquire the necessary supply through spot market purchases  and will therefore be exposed to market risk 
assuming duquesne power were to make such spot market purchases  we performed a sensitivity analysis using a hypothetical change in the projected forward market prices of electricity supply in our valuation model 
the analysis indicated that such market movements would change the projected cost of acquiring electricity supply by approximately million as of december  and approximately million as of december  for the polr iii period through the projected forward market prices used in our valuation model are derived from broker quotes for the applicable delivery points for both on peak and off peak power 
our valuation model seasonalizes annual or quarterly prices based on historical trends 
actual costs in the future may differ significantly from our analysis  however  based on changes in the timing and amount of commodity price fluctuations and our actual exposures 
the fair value of the sale contracts and certain purchase contracts that are classified as derivative instruments  is recorded as derivative assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the derivative energy contracts are exposed to commodity price risk based on price changes in the forward energy market 
therefore  as the forward market prices change  so will the fair value of these contracts 
a hypothetical change in the projected forward market prices of electricity supply would increase or decrease the fair value of our derivative energy contracts by approximately million including million related to our mark to market energy contracts as of december  and approximately million all mark to market energy contracts as of december  the amounts related to our mark to market energy contracts would also result in an increase or decrease to purchased power expense 
as a result of fixed polr prices for our residential and small commercial customers through december   and customers being able to initiate switches to and from polr service  we have an additional risk of loss 
specifically  customers could opt for polr service in a period of high energy prices or leave polr service for an alternative generation supplier in a period of low energy prices 
significant changes in customer switching behavior could cause duquesne power s energy supply portfolio to be disproportionate to its full requirements obligations to duquesne light and dle 
accordingly  duquesne power could be required to purchase or sell power in periods of high or low prices which could result in a loss 
during the third quarter of  one alternative supplier notified duquesne light that their customers would be returning to polr service beginning in the fourth quarter of had these customers been served under the polr arrangement during  the polr retention for residential and small commercial customers would have increased approximately one percentage point 
now that these customers have returned to polr service  one alternative supplier serves essentially all of the residential customers that are not currently on polr service 
this supplier recently announced a significant increase in its rates 
should all of these residential customers return to polr service  the polr retention for residential and small commercial customers would increase approximately ten percentage points 
landfill gas sales 
revenues from our pipeline quality landfill gas operations are based on current market prices of natural gas as calculated by the terms of the individual contracts 
recent increases in natural gas prices over historical levels have resulted in the realization of increased profits from this line of business 
in order to mitigate this exposure to fluctuations in market prices of natural gas  during we entered into a cash flow hedge for a portion of our anticipated sales 
for the remaining anticipated sales  a hypothetical change in the projected forward market prices of natural gas in our valuation model would not materially change projected revenues from pipeline quality landfill gas for the forward market prices used in our valuation model are derived from quoted market prices for the applicable pricing points 
actual costs in the future may differ significantly from our analysis  however  based on changes in the timing and amount of commodity price fluctuations and our actual exposures 
credit default risk 
our credit risk is the exposure to the possibility of economic loss that would occur as a result of 
table of contents nonperformance by counter parties of their contractual obligations 
duquesne power has entered into fixed price energy contracts and unforced capacity credit agreements 
as of december  all of the suppliers are investment grade 
as of december   duquesne power has contracted to purchase from one supplier approximately and of the notional values of the energy commodity contracts for the years ended december  and duquesne power has also contracted to purchase from one additional supplier approximately of the notional value of the energy commodity contracts for no other supplier represents as much as for each of the respective years 
duquesne power s energy commodity contracts contain certain provisions designed to mitigate potential losses by requiring collateral to be posted by either party depending on changes in energy or capacity prices 
as of january   no collateral was required to be posted under these contracts 
duquesne light purchases energy and capacity  beginning january   under a full requirements contract from two investment grade suppliers for sale to its large commercial and industrial customers receiving fixed price polr iii service 
duquesne light s contracts only require collateral to be posted by the counter party 
as of january   no collateral was required to be posted under these contracts 
in addition to collateral postings  supplier default risk is further mitigated by accelerated damage payment terms 
if a supplier fails to deliver the contracted power  we may exercise our right to force the supplier to compensate us for the difference between the market price and the contracted price of power 
if such supplier would fail to make the accelerated damage payments  the supplier would be in default and we would be permitted to apply any funds due that supplier against our excess energy costs 
other than large commercial and industrial polr iii customers on hourly priced service  duquesne light is obligated to serve its polr iii customers at fixed rates 
duquesne power is also contractually obligated to serve its customers  duquesne light and dle  at fixed rates 
if an energy supplier to duquesne light or duquesne power were to default on its contract  we could potentially be acquiring energy and or capacity at a cost in excess of our revenues  resulting in a loss  if the collateral provisions were not sufficient to cover such excess 
if this would occur it is uncertain  under the current puc approved polr iii arrangement  that duquesne light could pass any additional costs related to these energy and capacity purchases on to its customers 
tax credit phase out 
section tax credits are subject to a phase out provision that reduces tax credits as the average annual wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil increases into an inflation adjusted phase out range 
the phase out range will be calculated using inflation rates published in by the irs  but based on the average wellhead price to date we do not anticipate that there will be a phase out of tax credits in there was no phase out in if domestic crude oil prices stay at a high level in and or  the estimated annual tax credits to be generated from dqe financial s landfill gas operations and investment in a synthetic fuel partnership of approximately million  as well as duquesne energy solutions estimated annual after tax earnings of approximately million from its synthetic fuel facilities management contract may be substantially reduced or eliminated 
however  due to significant levels of tax credit carry forwards existing at holdings  the potential phase out of dqe financial s tax credits in and would not adversely impact our cash flow in those years 
based upon our evaluation  we have thus far determined not to enter into hedging arrangements to reduce this potential exposure 
in addition  as of december   we have certain tangible and intangible assets related to dqe financial s landfill gas operations with a net book value of approximately million that may become impaired if domestic crude oil prices continue to increase in the future 
as of december   we have no net book value related to synthetic fuel assets or investments
