the defense segment also received additional funding for the c maintenance training devices and funding for phase ii for the lightweight small arms technology program 
the increase in the energy segment s funded backlog was primarily due to an increase in orders received during compared to the company believes the increase in orders results primarily from increased prices for oil and gas 
backlog represents products or services that the company s customers have committed by contract to purchase from the company  but the company has not yet delivered

critical accounting policies application and use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the company s reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could be material 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important in estimating final contract costs for long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting and in developing the company s projected liabilities for pension and other post retirement benefits 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with legal matters 
the company applied its critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented in its consolidated financial statements and the company s management has discussed these policies with the audit committee 
commitments and contingencies the company recognizes a liability for legal indemnification and defense costs when it believes it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the liabilities are developed based on currently available information 
the accruals are recorded at undiscounted amounts if the company cannot reliably determine the timing of the cash payments  and the amounts are classified as non current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company also has insurance that covers certain losses and records receivables to the extent that claims can be reasonably estimated and realization is deemed probable 
the receivables are recorded at undiscounted amounts to coincide with the related accruals  and the amounts are classified as non current receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition the company follows the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term contracts 
sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
alternatively  certain contracts provide for the production of various units throughout the contract period  and sales and gross profit on these contracts are accounted for based on the units delivered 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
incentives or penalties  estimated warranty costs and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
when adjustments in contract value or estimated costs are determined  any changes from prior estimates are reflected in earnings in the current period 
anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
although management believes that the profits are fairly stated and that adequate provisions for losses on certain of the fixed price contracts have been recorded in the financial statements  revisions to such estimates do occur and at times are material to the company s results of operations and financial position 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
inventoried costs associated with long term contracts include costs and earnings of incomplete contracts not yet billable to the customer 
these amounts represent the difference between the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term contracts used to record operating results by the company s defense segment and the amounts billable to the customer under the terms of the specific contracts 
estimates of final contract costs and earnings including earnings subject to future determination through negotiation or other procedures are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
income taxes the company files income tax returns and estimates income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
the company is subject to tax audits in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in changes to the estimated taxes 
the amount of these changes would vary by jurisdiction and would be recorded when known 
management has considered future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets at december   and concluded that no allowance was required at that time 
the company has recorded liabilities for tax contingencies for open years 
the company does not expect the resolution of tax matters for these years to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

the amount of contingent interest payable in respect of any six month period will equal of the average market price of the convertible senior notes for the specified period referred to above

foreign currency a portion of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions  and some of these transactions are denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have a significant impact on the balance sheet or results from operations
