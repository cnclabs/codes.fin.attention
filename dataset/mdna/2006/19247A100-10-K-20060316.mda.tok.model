liquidity and capital resources our investment advisory business does not require us to maintain significant capital balances 
our current financial condition is highly liquid  with the majority of our assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our cash flows are generally created as a result of the operating activities of our business segments  with investment advisory and administrative fees a significant contributor 
cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and marketable securities available for sale were and of total assets as of december  and  respectively 
net cash from operating activities increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the change from to is primarily attributable to an increase in accrued compensation as year end bonuses for were paid in january year end bonuses for were paid in december we expect that cash flows provided by operating activities will continue to serve as the principal source of working capital in our near future

we have consistently maintained net capital in excess of the regulatory requirements for our broker dealers  as prescribed by the sec 
at december   our regulatory net capital exceeded the minimum requirement by approximately million 
the sec s uniform net capital rule c imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the sec for certain withdrawals of capital 
we believe that our cash flows from operations will be more than adequate to meet our anticipated capital requirements and other obligations as they become due 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our non cancelable operating lease agreements for office space and capital leases for office equipment 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and after total operating leases  net    capital lease obligations total contractual obligations    off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support  or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a thorough understanding of our accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
our management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of these and additional accounting policies  see note of the notes to the annual audited consolidated financial statements 
investments management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re evaluates such determination at each statement of financial condition date 
marketable securities classified as available for sale are primarily comprised of investments in our sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds as well as highly rated debt and preferred instruments 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss  or impairment  to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 
if we believe an impairment on a security position is other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our audited consolidated statement of income 
minor impairments that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 
long lived assets property and equipment are recorded at historical cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is recognized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the lease 
deferred commissions consist of commissions paid in advance to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain shares of company sponsored open end load mutual funds and are capitalized and amortized over a period not to exceed six years 
all long lived assets are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may be impaired 
if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value of such asset exceeded its fair value 
goodwill and intangible asset the intangible asset is amortized over its useful life 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of an acquired company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value to carrying amount  including goodwill 
investment advisory and administration fees we earn the majority of our revenue by providing asset management services to our sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds and to institutional separate accounts 
this revenue is earned pursuant to the terms of the underlying advisory contract and is based on a contractual investment advisory fee applied to the assets in the portfolio 
we earn revenue from administration fees paid by certain sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds  based on the average daily net assets of such funds 
this revenue is recognized as such fees are earned 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires public companies to recognize expense in the income statement for the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments granted to employees 
expense is recognized over the period during which employees are required to provide service 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future years 
deferred liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable income in future years

fsp eitf  distribution fees by distributors of mutual funds that do not have a front end sales charge  when cash for the right to future distribution fees for shares previously sold is received from third parties 
fsp eitf did not materially impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to the risk of interest rate  securities market and general economic fluctuations which may have an adverse impact on the value of our marketable securities 
at december   approximately million was invested in our sponsored equity funds 
we had approximately million invested in us treasury and us government agency securities  million invested in preferred securities and million invested in foreign and domestic equities as of december  in addition  a significant majority of our revenue approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  is derived from investment advisory agreements with our clients 
under these agreements  the investment advisory and administration fee we receive is typically based on the market value of the assets we manage 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  and real estate securities in particular  may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees  or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  which would also result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 
in addition  market conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closed end mutual funds 
a significant portion of our recent growth in the assets we manage has resulted from public offerings of the shares of closed end mutual funds 
the market conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future  which could adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and realize higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
the returns for reit common stocks have demonstrated little correlation with interest rates over longer periods of time 
however  an increase in interest rates could have a negative impact on the valuation of reits and other securities in our clients portfolios  which could reduce our revenue 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could negatively impact our ability to increase open end mutual fund assets and to offer new mutual funds
