item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview for a further discussion 
electric operations og e general the electric utility segment generates  transmits  distributes and sells electric energy in oklahoma and western arkansas 
its operations are conducted through og e 
og e furnishes retail electric service in communities and their contiguous rural and suburban areas 
during  five other communities and four rural electric cooperatives in oklahoma and western arkansas purchased electricity from og e for resale 
the service area  with an estimated population of million  covers approximately  square miles in oklahoma and western arkansas  including oklahoma city  the largest city in oklahoma  and fort smith  arkansas  the second largest city in that state 
of the communities that og e serves  are located in oklahoma and in arkansas 
og e derived approximately percent of its total electric operating revenues for the year ended december  from sales in oklahoma and the remainder from sales in arkansas 
og e s system control area peak demand as reported by the system dispatcher during was approximately  mw s on july  og e s load responsibility peak demand was approximately  mw s on july   resulting in a capacity margin of approximately percent 
as reflected in the table below and in the operating statistics on page  there were approximately million megawatt hour mwh sales in as compared to approximately million in and million in mwh sales to og e s customers system sales increased approximately percent in primarily due to warmer weather during sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales remained flat in variances in off system sales are due in large part to the changing supply and demand needs on og e s generation system and the market for off system sales 
variations in mwh sales for the three years are reflected in the following table increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease system sales a off system sales a total sales a sales are in millions of mwh s 
og e is subject to competition in various degrees from government owned electric systems  municipally owned electric systems  rural electric cooperatives and  in certain respects  from other private utilities  power marketers and cogenerators 
oklahoma law forbids the granting of an exclusive franchise to a utility for providing electricity 
og e is currently in negotiations regarding the renewal of its oklahoma city franchise and og e currently expects the franchise to be renewed for a year term later this year 
besides competition from other suppliers or marketers of electricity  og e competes with suppliers of other forms of energy 
the degree of competition between suppliers may vary depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the potential impact on competition from federal and state legislation

the issuance of certain securities by og e is also regulated by the occ and the apsc 
og e s wholesale electric tariffs  short term borrowing authorization and accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc 
the secretary of the department of energy has jurisdiction over some of og e s facilities and operations 
for the year ended december  approximately percent of og e s electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the occ  nine percent to the apsc and four percent to the ferc 
the occ issued an order in authorizing og e to reorganize into a subsidiary of the company 
the order required that  among other things  i the company permit the occ access to the books and records of the company and its affiliates relating to transactions with og e  ii the company employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect against subsidization of non utility activities by og e s customers  and iii the company refrain from pledging og e assets or income for affiliate transactions 
in addition  the energy policy act of enacted the public utility holding company act of  which in turn granted to the ferc access to the books and records of the company and its affiliates as the ferc deems relevant to costs incurred by og e or necessary or appropriate for the protection of utility customers with respect to jurisdictional rates 
regulatory matters gas transportation and storage agreement as part of the settlement of an og e rate case in november the settlement agreement  og e agreed to consider competitive bidding as a basis to select its provider for gas transportation service to its natural gas fired generation facilities pursuant to the terms set forth in the settlement agreement 
because the required integrated service was not available in the marketplace from parties other than enogex  og e advised the occ that  after careful consideration  competitive bidding for gas transportation was rejected in favor of a new intrastate integrated  firm no notice load following gas transportation and storage services agreement with enogex 
this seven year agreement provides for gas transportation and storage services for each of og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
og e will pay enogex annual demand fees of approximately million for the right to transport specified maximum daily quantities mdq and maximum hourly quantities mhq of gas at various minimum gas delivery pressures depending on the operational needs of the individual generating facility 
in addition  og e supplies system fuel in kind for its pro rata share of actual fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas on the transportation system 
to the extent og e transports gas in quantities in excess of the prescribed mdq s or mhq s  it pays an overrun service charge 
during the years ended december   and  og e paid enogex approximately million  million and million  respectively  for gas transportation and storage services 
on july   the occ issued an order in this case approving a million annual recovery 
the occ order disallowed the recovery by og e of the amount that enogex charges og e for the cost of fuel used  or otherwise unaccounted for  in providing natural gas transportation and storage service to og e 
over the last three years  this amount has ranged from million to million annually 
this amount was approximately million in and is projected to be approximately million in the occ s order required og e to refund to its oklahoma customers the difference between the amounts collected from such customers in the past based on an annual rate of million for gas transportation and storage services and the million annual rate authorized by the occ s order 
based on the order  og e s refund obligation was approximately million 
og e began refunding this obligation in september through its automatic fuel adjustment clause 
the balance of the refund obligation was approximately million at december  for further information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the enogex gas transportation and storage agreement  og e has also recorded a refund obligation in arkansas 
og e expects to meet with the apsc in early to determine the amount of the refund 
og e estimated its refund obligation to be approximately million at december  to arkansas customers assuming the arkansas refund obligation is calculated consistent with the oklahoma calculation 
og e oklahoma rate case filing on may   og e filed with the occ an application for an annual rate increase of approximately million to recover  among other things  its investment in  and the operating expenses of  the mcclain plant 
as a result of the mcclain plant acquisition completed on july   and consistent with the settlement agreement with the occ  og e had the right to accrue a regulatory asset  for a period not to exceed months subsequent to the acquisition and operation of the mcclain plant  consisting of the non fuel operation and maintenance expenses  depreciation  cost of debt associated with the investment and ad valorem taxes 
og e s rate case application included an estimate of million related to the mcclain plant regulatory asset 
at december   the actual incurred expenses included in the mcclain plant regulatory asset were approximately million 
such costs will be recovered over a four year time period as authorized in the occ rate order beginning in january the occ also authorized approximately million of the million regulatory asset to be included in og e s rate base for purposes of earning a return 
the application also included  among other things  implementation of enhanced reliability programs in og e s system  increased fuel oil inventory  the establishment of a separate recovery mechanism for major storm expense  the establishment of new rate classes for public schools and related facilities  the establishment of a military base rider  the establishment of a new low income assistance tariff and the proposal to make the guaranteed flat bill pilot tariff permanent for residential and small business customers 
on september   several parties filed responsive testimony reflecting various positions on the issues related to this case 
in particular  the testimony of the occ staff recommended that og e be entitled a rate increase of approximately million  one seventh the amount requested by og e in its may  application 
the recommendations in the testimony of the attorney general s office and the oklahoma industrial energy consumers recommended a rate decrease of approximately million and million  respectively 
hearings in the rate case began on october  and concluded on october  on november   the referee appointed by the occ for this proceeding issued a report recommending an estimated rate increase of approximately million for og e 
on december   the occ issued an order providing for a million increase in rates and a percent return on equity  based on a capital structure consisting of percent equity and percent debt 
the new rates became effective in january also included in the order  among other things  are new depreciation rates effective january and a provision which modified og e s mechanism for the recovery of over or under recovered fuel costs from its customers to allow interest to be applied to the over or under recovery

southwest power pool og e is a member of the southwest power pool spp  the regional reliability organization for all or parts of oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  new mexico  mississippi  missouri and texas 
the regional state committee  which is comprised of commissioners of the applicable state regulatory commissions  finished its process of formulating a methodology for funding transmission expansion in the spp control area by allocating costs of transmission expansion to the spp members who benefit 
the spp board of directors adopted this plan and filed it with the ferc on february   docket no 
er the ferc conditionally accepted the plan on april  with an effective date of may  the spp made a second compliance filing on october  on various minor issues associated with the plan 
on january   the ferc conditionally accepted the compliance filing  but required the spp to make minor wording changes within days 
the spp filed these minor wording changes on february  also  the spp filed on june   docket no 
er  to create a real time  offer based imbalance energy market which will require cash settlements for over or under generation 
market participants  including og e  will be required to submit resource plans and can submit offer curves for each resource available for dispatch 
in addition  the filing contains provisions allowing the spp to order certain dispatching of generating units and a market monitoring plan which provides a clear set of rules  the potential consequences if the rules are violated and the areas in which an independent market monitor will examine and report 
the scheduled implementation date of the imbalance energy market is may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
regulatory assets and liabilities og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain actual or anticipated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
og e records certain actual or anticipated costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable  based on regulatory orders or other available evidence  that the cost or obligation will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates 
at december  and  og e had regulatory assets of approximately million and million  respectively  and regulatory liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that was to restructure the electric utility industry in those states 
the arkansas legislation was repealed and implementation of the oklahoma restructuring legislation has been delayed and seems unlikely to proceed during the near future 
yet  if and when implemented  this legislation could deregulate og e s electric generation assets and cause og e to discontinue the use of sfas no 
with respect to its related regulatory balances 
the previously enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation would not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and og e believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory balances is appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain regulatory matters including the gas transportation and storage contract between og e and enogex  og e s rate case order  security enhancements  national energy legislation and state legislative initiatives 
rate activities and proposals since  og e has had several different customer programs and rate options 
the guaranteed flat bill gfb option for residential and small general service accounts allows qualifying customers the opportunity to purchase their electricity needs at a set price for an entire year 
budget minded customers that desire a fixed monthly bill may benefit from the gfb option 
the gfb option received occ approval for permanent rate status in og e s recently concluded rate case 
a second tariff rate option provides a renewable energy resource to og e s oklahoma retail customers 
this renewable energy resource is a wind power purchase program and is available as a voluntary option to all of og e s oklahoma retail customers 
oklahoma s availability of wind resources makes the renewable wind power option a possible choice in meeting the renewable energy needs of our conservation minded customers 
a third rate offering available to commercial and industrial customers is levelized demand billing 
this program is beneficial for medium to large size customers with seasonally consistent demand levels who wish to reduce the variability of their monthly electric bills 
another program being offered to og e s commercial and industrial customers is a voluntary load curtailment program 
this program provides customers with the opportunity to curtail on a voluntary basis when og e s system conditions merit curtailment action 
customers that curtail their usage will receive payment for their curtailment response 
this voluntary curtailment program seeks customers that can curtail on most curtailment event days  but may not be able to curtail every time that a curtailment event is required 
the previously discussed rate options coupled with og e s other rate choices provide many tariff options for og e s oklahoma retail customers 
og e s rate choice flexibility  reduction in cogeneration rates  acquisition of additional generation resources and overall low costs of production and deliverability are expected to provide valuable benefits for our customers for many years to come 
the revenue impacts associated with these options are indeterminate in future years since customers may choose to remain on existing rate options instead of volunteering for the new rate option choices 
there was no overall material impact in or associated with these rate options  but minimal revenue variations may occur in the future based upon changes in customers usage characteristics if they choose these programs 
in  the gfb pilot customers continued to renew at the renewal rate of over percent 
as part of the rate order issued by the occ in december  og e received occ approval for the creation of two new rate classes  public schools demand and public schools non demand 
these two classes of service will provide og e flexibility to provide targeted programs for load management to public schools and their unique usage patterns 
another item approved in the order was the creation of service level fuel differentiation which allows customers to pay fuel costs that better reflect energy losses on a service level basis 
the occ order also approved a military base rider which demonstrates oklahoma s continued commitment to our military partners 
og e s highly successful wind program was authorized to lower its cost on a per kwh basis  which provides subscribing customers the increased incentive to hedge against future natural gas prices 
the order also enables og e s low income qualified customers to receive relief on their summer electric bills by waiving the customer charge on their monthly bills from june to september of each year 
also included in og e s rate case application  but not approved  was the establishment of a separate recovery mechanism for major storm expense 
fuel supply during  approximately percent of the og e generated energy was produced by coal fired units and percent by natural gas fired units 
of og e s  total mw capability reflected in the table under item properties  approximately  mw s  or percent  are from natural gas generation and approximately  mw s  or percent  are from coal generation 
though og e has a higher installed capability of generation from natural gas units  it has been more economical to generate electricity for our customers using lower priced coal 
a slight decline in the percentage of coal generation in future years is expected to result from increased usage of natural gas generation required to meet growing energy needs 
over the last five years  the weighted average cost of fuel used  by type  per million british thermal unit mmbtu was as follows coal natural gas weighted average the increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in and in was primarily due to increased natural gas prices and increased amounts of natural gas being burned 
the increase in the weighted average cost of fuel in as compared to was primarily due to increased natural gas prices in partially offset by a lower amount of natural gas burned in the decrease in the weighted average cost of fuel in as compared to was primarily due to lower natural gas prices in partially offset by a higher amount of natural gas burned in a portion of these fuel costs is included in the base rates to customers and differs for each jurisdiction 
the portion of these fuel costs that is not included in the base rates is recoverable through og e s regulatorily approved automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
coal all of og e s coal fired units  with an aggregate capability of approximately  mw s  are designed to burn low sulfur western coal 
og e purchases coal primarily under long term contracts expiring in years and during  og e purchased approximately million tons of coal from the following wyoming suppliers kennecott energy company  arch coal inc triton coal company  peabody coal sales company and foundation coal west  inc the combination of all coal has a weighted average sulfur content of less than percent and can be burned in these units under existing federal  state and local environmental standards maximum of lbs 
of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu without the addition of sulfur dioxide removal systems 
based upon the average sulfur content  og e s coal units have an approximate emission rate of lbs 
of sulfur dioxide per mmbtu  well within the limitations of the provisions of the federal clean air act discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
og e has continued its efforts to maximize the utilization of its coal fired units at its sooner and muskogee generating plants 
see environmental laws and regulations in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of environmental matters affecting og e 
coal shipment disruption in july  og e received notification from union pacific railroad union pacific that  in may  union pacific and bnsf railway bnsf experienced successive derailments on the jointly owned rail line serving the southern powder river basin coal producers 
according to union pacific  these two derailments were caused by track that had become unstable from an accumulation of coal dust in the roadbed combined with unusually heavy rainfall 
bnsf  which maintains and operates the line  concluded that a significant part of the line needed to be repaired before normal train operations could resume 
while the repairs were taking place  union pacific was unable to operate at full capacity from the powder river basin 
in november  union pacific notified og e that the south powder river basin joint line force majeure condition that was declared in may had ended 
on december   bnsf completed the enhanced joint line maintenance program which opened the way for a return to normal operating conditions 
it is expected that as rail traffic improves  og e will be able to increase its level of coal inventories 
at december   og e had slightly more than days of coal supply for each of its coal fired units at its sooner and muskogee generating plants 
natural gas og e utilized a request for bid rfb to acquire approximately percent of its projected annual natural gas requirements for all of these contracts are tied to various gas price market indices and most will expire in december additional natural gas supply for the summer of will be secured through a new rfb issued in the first quarter of og e will meet additional natural gas requirements with monthly and daily purchases as required 
in  og e began utilizing a natural gas storage facility that allowed og e to maximize the value of its generation assets  which storage services are now provided by enogex as part of enogex s gas transportation and storage contract with og e 
at december   og e had approximately million mmbtu s in natural gas storage that it acquired for approximately million 
wind during  og e contracted with fpl energy for mw s of electricity generated at a wind farm near woodward  oklahoma 
after more than one year of marketing wind power to og e s residential and business customers  almost  subscribed for all or part of their electricity usage 
as of january   og e s current wind program is fully subscribed 
since og e last requested bids to determine the cost of adding wind to its system  natural gas prices have continued to rise and federal renewable energy tax credits have been extended 
on december   the company issued a press release announcing that og e had entered into a non binding letter of intent to purchase a mw wind farm planned for construction in northwestern oklahoma 
invenergy wind development oklahoma llc invenergy llc would develop the new wind power generation facility to be owned and operated by og e 
the wind farm  north of woodward in harper county  is expected to cost approximately million  including the cost of transmission interconnection facilities 
a definitive agreement to engineer  procure and construct wind generation energy system epc contract was reached on february   subject to various conditions 
those conditions include agreement by the parties as to certain exhibits to the epc contract  approval of the epc contract by the og e board of directors and approval of the epc contract by the manager of invenergy llc  all of which have to be completed on or before march  in addition  days subsequent to the occurrence of these events  og e or invenergy llc have the unilateral right to terminate the epc contract if certain additional events have not occurred  including the following i occ approval of the terms of the epc contract and of a recovery rider providing og e the opportunity to recover all costs associated with the wind facility  including transmission interconnection and transmission upgrade costs  ii completion by the spp of all necessary transmission studies  iii invenergy llc s acquisition of certain land agreements  iv invenergy llc s execution of a contract acceptable to og e with a balance of work contractor  and v invenergy llc s acquisition of certain permits 
if all of these conditions are met  the new wind farm is expected to be constructed and producing power on or before december  occ hearings are expected to occur in april see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
natural gas pipeline operations enogex overview the operations of the natural gas pipeline segment are conducted through enogex and consist of three related businesses i the transportation and storage of natural gas  ii the gathering and processing of natural gas and iii the marketing of natural gas 
enogex s focus is to utilize its gathering  processing  transportation and storage capacity to execute physical  financial and service transactions to capture margins across different commodities  locations or time periods 
the vast majority of enogex s natural gas gathering  processing  transportation and storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of oklahoma 
enogex and its subsidiaries operate approximately  miles of intrastate gas gathering and transportation pipelines 
prior to october   enogex owned  through a percent interest in noark  a controlling interest in and operated ogt  a ferc regulated interstate pipeline that extends from southeast oklahoma through arkansas to southeast missouri 
on october   enogex sold its interest in eapc  which held the noark interest 
also  during the third quarter of  enogex compression sold it majority interest in enerven  a joint venture focused on the rental of natural gas compression assets 
the eapc and enerven businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements and are discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
strategy the transportation  storage and gathering assets of enogex provide og e strategic access to natural gas supplies  and flexible and reliable delivery terms that are required to fuel og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
natural gas generation peaking units require the ability to quickly change their status  to meet both the peak and off peak demands of the retail load particularly when coal units have an unscheduled outage 
the gathering assets access major wellhead supply sources primarily located across oklahoma  and the integrated transportation and storage assets provide the ability to regulate the receipt and delivery of natural gas to match the instantaneous needs of these generation units 
natural gas fired generation units contribute their highest value when they have the capability to provide load following service to the customer ie  the ability of the generation unit to regulate generation to respond to and meet the instantaneous changes in customer demand 
while the physical characteristics of natural gas units are known to provide quick start up and on line functionality  and while their ability to efficiently provide varying levels of electric generation relative to other forms of generation is further acknowledged  their ultimate effectiveness is contingent upon having access to an integrated pipeline and storage system that can respond in a short term fashion to meet the corresponding fluctuating operational fuel requirements 
the combination of these assets is critical to a generator s ability to provide reliable generation service at reasonable prices to the consumer 
not only is enogex providing service to og e  but enogex s same assets provide firm and interruptible services to a significant portion of the other natural gas fired generation loads in oklahoma 
enogex understands the needs of generators  and more importantly has the appropriately sized pipelines  compression and integrated storage assets necessary to meet their requirements 
through enogex s gathering and processing assets  enogex aggregates gas supplies for its markets and also for those markets accessible via its numerous intrastate and interstate pipeline connections 
it aggressively pursues new supplies from wells drilled by producers primarily in the anadarko and arkoma basins 
oklahoma ranks second in the nation in onshore natural gas production and ranks second in the nation as a natural gas exporting state 
the system capacity  due to its large diameter gathering pipelines and its natural gas processing plants  is capable of adapting to the varying pressure and quality requirements of mid continent production 
enogex is able to provide low pressure service to extend the production life of older wells as well as meeting the high pressure requirements of new exploration 
enogex  through its processing plants  is also able to remove natural gas liquids from the wellhead gas streams  which is necessary for such gas to meet quality specifications of the downstream marketplace 
besides the core activities described above  the transportation capabilities and markets of enogex s pipeline assets provide other business opportunities 
these include the ability of enogex to use its pipeline system and storage assets as a market hub 
at december   enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipeline interconnect points providing access to markets in the western united states  the midwest  northeast  and gulf coast in addition to oklahoma and adjoining states 
as a result  enogex s assets sit in a key geographic region of the united states  with sufficient capacity to provide crosshaul transportation and storage services to a variety of utility and industrial customers that need to access mid continent natural gas supply for their own needs  or to suppliers from other regions seeking to provide gas to on system markets which enogex serves 
enogex s marketing business provides products and services that support the market hub concept and are an important element in the company realizing the full value of its transportation and storage assets 
the marketing business offers the company real time and longer term price discovery and valuation of energy commodities natural gas and associated natural gas liquids associated with the company s assets 
the marketing business is instrumental in providing increased liquidity for these energy commodities  by focusing on developing supplies and markets that can access the enogex systems either directly or via interconnections with intrastate and interstate pipelines 
the marketing business also provides the company the capability to provide risk management services to its customers 
the company intends to continue to build upon the foundation of services and products that these assets can provide 
in addition  the company expects to generate additional margins by improving its ability to aggregate gas  maximize the operational capabilities of its assets and utilize commercial information available from the marketplace 
on november   enogex announced that it had entered into a letter of intent with el paso corporation el paso that is designed to accelerate el paso s continental connector project 
the letter of intent contemplates arrangements by which el paso or an affiliate would execute an initial lease of up to  decatherms per day dth day of capacity on the enogex pipeline system  with an option to expand up to million dth day  so that the leased enogex pipeline capacity would become an integral part of the continental connector project 
the letter of intent also contemplates a commitment by enogex to secure up to  dth day of capacity subscriptions for the project 
these arrangements would significantly reduce the amount of new mainline construction required for the project  resulting in less environmental disturbance and an earlier in service target date of winter under the letter of intent  the continental connector project will use existing or expanded el paso pipeline systems to transport capacity constrained natural gas from rocky mountain and mid continent supply regions to custer  oklahoma 
at custer  this gas and local mid continent production will be transported on existing and expanded enogex systems for continental connector under a long term lease arrangement for re delivery in the vicinity of bennington  oklahoma 
from there  gas will be transported on new el paso pipeline facilities through the perryville  louisiana  hub to a termination with tennessee and southern natural pipelines at pugh  mississippi 
enogex intends to work with el paso to determine whether to advance this project 
however  the commitments and obligations under the letter of intent are subject to various conditions  including definitive documentation and boards of directors and regulatory approvals and there can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied 
pending satisfaction of these conditions  enogex does not expect to incur material expenditures 
dispositions beginning in  enogex evaluated  redesigned and reorganized its internal work processes and senior management structure in order to achieve cost reductions  revenue enhancements and strategic leadership within its businesses 
as a part of this process  enogex implemented a number of steps intended to maximize the value of its assets 
processing and compression assets 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million in the natural gas pipeline segment related to enogex natural gas processing and compression assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million related to these natural gas compression assets 
during the year ended december   the company sold certain of its compression and processing assets for approximately million and recognized an after tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of these assets 
the carrying amount of the remaining assets that were the subject of the impairment charges in the fourth quarters of and was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as discussed below  for any remaining assets that were the subject of the impairment charges in the fourth quarters of and  the company either contributed the assets to the joint venture described below or reclassified these assets from held for sale to held and used as of december  during the third quarter of  enogex entered into a joint venture arrangement with a third party and contributed certain of its natural gas compression assets with a carrying amount of approximately million to the joint venture 
the objective of the joint venture was to derive value from the assets by renting the natural gas compressors 
enogex compression was created to act as the participating entity in the joint venture 
enogex compression held a majority ownership in the joint venture  although the actual ownership percentages fluctuated based on the relative capital contributions of enogex compression and the third party member 
the third party acted as the manager and conducted the daily operations of the joint venture 
in april  enogex compression received an unsolicited offer to buy its interest in enerven 
after evaluating this offer  enogex compression sold its interest in enerven for approximately million in august enogex compression recognized an after tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of this business 
during the third quarter of  the company reclassified an asset from assets held for sale to assets held and used 
this asset had a carrying amount of approximately million at the time the asset was reclassified 
in october  the company reclassified a large electric driven compressor that was previously classified as assets held for sale to assets held and used 
this compressor had a carrying amount of approximately million at september  in december  the company reclassified several compressors and processing plants that were previously classified as assets held for sale to assets held and used 
these assets had a carrying amount of approximately million at december  transportation and storage 
during september  enogex received notification from a customer that a transportation agreement involving four of enogex s non contiguous pipeline asset segments located in west texas and used to serve the customer s power plants would be terminated effective december  in response to this notification  the company recognized  during the third quarter of  a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million in the natural gas pipeline segment related to enogex natural gas pipeline assets that were used to provide service to this customer 
in december  the company received notification that all of this customers plants in west texas were shut down and service was no longer required 
the company is currently evaluating other commercial opportunities for these assets as well as contacting other parties that may be interested in acquiring any of these assets 
in january  ogt recognized a gain of approximately million and approximately million in minority interest expense related to the sale of approximately miles of transmission lines of its pipeline 
enogex regularly evaluates the long term stability  profitability and core competency of each of its businesses within the regulatory and market framework in which each business operates 
based on these evaluations  in september  enogex announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its interest in eapc  which held the noark interest 
this sale was completed on october  the company received approximately million cash proceeds and recognized an after tax gain of approximately million from the sale of this business in the fourth quarter 
enogex used approximately million of the proceeds to repay principal and accrued interest on long term debt and approximately million to pay taxes associated with eapc 
the balance of the proceeds of approximately million will be used to invest  over time  in strategic assets to diversify its asset base 
capital expenditures  improvement projects 
in  enogex completed a major upgrade of its information systems that began in enogex believes that these upgrades will be a major step towards obtaining the data required to allow it to capture available economic opportunities on its assets  provide improved customer service and enable management to better determine the earnings potential of its various assets and service offerings 
one information system implemented provided a single system for pipeline equipment control  data collection  management and measurement of gas volumes and pressures  which has improved enogex s access to critical data for daily system management decisions 
another information system implemented  together with the company s primary enterprise wide general ledger software  has been used to accumulate and analyze financial data used in financial reporting 
this change in information systems was made to eliminate previous stand alone systems and integrate them into one system 
on a company wide basis  the company is the process of implementing an enhanced digital asset mapping technology for both og e and enogex and expects to complete the implementation of this new technology by may the new system is expected to support a significant increase in the number of members who use this technology in their jobs  expanding the productive use of geographic asset information in a variety of ways  including daily operations  maintenance  budgeting  planning  purchasing and accounting 
also  enogex began work on a flow data access project called productionwatch at the end of the second quarter of initial phases of implementation are expected to be completed by mid year with the final phases of implementation of this project being completed by the end of productionwatch is a service that provides data volume  pressure  temperature  etc 
from the enogex meter to enogex s customers for a fee 
productionwatch data will be available to customers via the internet and it may also be downloaded by customers from enogex network servers 
such data is attractive because it enables enogex customers to increase gas production and reduce operating costs 
from enogex s perspective  productionwatch provides enogex with an additional revenue stream while helping enogex operate more efficiently 
during  enogex made improvements to the stuart storage facility which reduced water encroachment in the field 
during  approximately million of capital investment was made on this project 
there were no capital expenditures on this project in enogex does not expect any material future expenditures on this water encroachment project 
transportation and storage general 
one of enogex s primary lines of business is the transportation of natural gas  with current throughput of approximately trillion british thermal units btu per day 
enogex delivers natural gas to most interstate and intrastate pipelines and end users connected to its systems from the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma  the anadarko basin of western oklahoma and the panhandle of west texas 
at december   enogex was connected to other major pipelines at approximately pipeline interconnect points 
these interconnections include panhandle eastern pipe line  southern star central gas pipeline formerly williams central  natural gas pipeline company of america  oneok gas transmission  northern natural gas company  anr pipeline  western farmers electric cooperative  centerpoint energy gas transmission co  el paso natural gas pipeline  enbridge pipelines  oneok westex transmission lp and ozark gas transmission  llc further  enogex is connected to various end users including numerous electric generation facilities in oklahoma that are fueled by natural gas 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s transportation and storage business was approximately million 
enogex owns two storage facilities in oklahoma  the wetumka storage facility and the stuart storage facility 
these storage facilities are currently being operated at a working gas level of approximately billion cubic feet bcf with an approximate withdrawal capability of million cubic feet per day mmcfd and similar injection capability 
enogex offers both firm and interruptible storage services to third parties  under section of the natural gas policy act ngpa  under terms and conditions specified in its statement of operating conditions soc for gas storage and at market based rates negotiated with each customer 
both facilities are used to support enogex s intrastate transportation and storage services for og e 
enogex offers interruptible section transportation services as well as both firm and interruptible services to intrastate customers with a majority of transportation revenues derived from firm intrastate contracts 
enogex offers interruptible service to customers when capacity is available 
enogex provides firm intrastate transportation and storage services to several customers and enogex s major customers are og e as well as public service company of oklahoma pso  the second largest electric utility in oklahoma  serving the tulsa market 
enogex provides gas transmission delivery services to all of pso s natural gas fired electric generation units in oklahoma under a firm intrastate transportation contract 
the current pso contract  which has been extended to january   and the og e contract  which expires april   provide for a monthly demand charge plus variable transportation charges including fuel 
as part of the contract with og e  enogex provides additional natural gas storage services for og e 
enogex has been providing natural gas storage services since august when enogex acquired the stuart storage facility from central oklahoma oil and gas corp 
coog 
during  and  enogex s revenues from its firm intrastate transportation and storage contracts were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as previously discussed  in october  enogex sold its interest in eapc  which held the noark interest 
relationship with og e 
from its inception  enogex has been the transporter of natural gas to og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
og e s rates are subject to occ jurisdiction 
the occ issued an order on november  which contained a provision  among other things  that og e would consider competitive bidding for gas transportation service to its natural gas fired generation facilities when the contract with enogex expired 
the term of the then current contract was to expire in april following a consideration of competitive bidding by og e as required by the prior order from the occ  the contract with enogex was amended by an agreement dated may  with no notice load following requirements and a termination date of april  as part of the contract with og e  enogex provides additional natural gas storage services for og e beyond the level and flexibility that was provided previously 
enogex has been providing natural gas storage services since august when enogex acquired the stuart storage facility from coog 
the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract for transportation services was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and the amount collected from og e by enogex under the current contract for storage services was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and in july  og e received an occ order related to its application to recover the costs of gas transportation and storage services provided to og e by enogex pursuant to the contract between og e and enogex 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter 
competition 
enogex s transportation and storage assets compete with interstate and other intrastate pipeline and storage facilities in providing transportation and storage services for natural gas 
the principal elements of competition are rates  terms of services  flexibility and reliability of service 
natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to enogex s customers and end users  including electricity  coal and fuel oils 
the primary competitive factor is price 
changes in the availability or price of natural gas or other forms of energy as well as weather and other factors affect the demand for natural gas on the enogex system 
regulation 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas on behalf of an interstate natural gas pipeline company or a local distribution company served by an interstate natural gas pipeline company are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under section of the ngpa 
rates to provide such service must be fair and equitable under the ngpa and are subject to review and approval by the ferc at least once every three years 
this rate review may  but will not necessarily  involve an administrative type hearing before the ferc staff panel and an administrative appellate review 
by offering interruptible section transportation  the regulatory burden on enogex is not appreciably increased  but does give enogex the opportunity to utilize any unused capacity on an interruptible basis in interstate commerce and thus increase its transportation revenues 
enogex s approved section rate structure includes a provision for enogex to charge a fixed fuel percentage for the fuel usage for natural gas shipped on its system 
the fixed fuel percentage is adjusted annually and is in effect for a calendar fuel year unless enogex files with the ferc to adjust it more frequently 
the mechanism used to recover such fuel is a fuel tracker that establishes a fixed fuel factor expressed as a percentage of natural gas shipped that is trued up over a two year period and based on the value of the gas at the time of usage 
on september   enogex made a filing at the ferc to revise its previously approved soc to permit  among other things  the unbundling  effective october   of its previously bundled gathering and transportation services 
as a result  effective october   the ferc regulates enogex s section transportation and any regulation of gathering is pursuant to oklahoma statute 
on september   enogex made its required triennial filing at the ferc to update its section maximum interruptible transportation rate 
on september   enogex filed an updated fuel factor with the ferc for the last quarter of finally  on november   enogex filed its annual updated fuel factor for fuel year calendar year 
various parties intervened and protested the four filings but  after three technical conferences and various settlement discussions  reached a unanimous settlement that the ferc approved without modification or condition  by order of september  the settlement established new maximum interruptible section zonal rates for an east zone and a west zone on the enogex system  confirmed that enogex could unbundle its gathering and transportation services and permitted the fuel factor percentages for the last quarter of and for fuel year to become effective  as filed 
the ferc order concluded all four proceedings which resulted in no refunds being due 
because the ferc requires all intrastate pipeline offering service to file a rate case every three years  enogex must file its next rate case no later than october  as required by the fuel tracker provisions of the soc  enogex made its annual fuel filing for the fuel year on november  as agreed in the settlement  the fuel filing for the first time proposed an east zone fuel percentage and a west zone fuel percentage to be recalculated annually to replace the system wide fuel percentage previously calculated annually for the whole enogex system 
four parties moved to intervene 
one party posed questions about the filing that enogex answered on january  the ferc staff later served data requests that enogex answered on february  the ferc has not yet acted on the filing 
the rates charged by enogex for transporting natural gas for og e and other shippers within oklahoma are not subject to ferc regulation because they are intrastate transactions 
with respect to state regulation  the rates charged by enogex for any intrastate transportation service have not been subject to direct state regulation by the occ 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc all of which approve various electric rates of og e have the authority to examine the appropriateness of any transportation charges or other fees paid by og e to enogex which og e seeks to recover from its ratepayers in its cost of service for electric service 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the occ order og e received in july related to the amounts charged og e by enogex for gas transportation and storage services 
enogex s pipeline operations are subject to various oklahoma safety and environmental and non discriminatory transportation requirements 
gathering and processing general 
natural gas gathering operations are conducted through enogex gas gathering llc gathering  and natural gas processing operations are conducted through enogex products corporation products 
the streams of processable natural gas gathered from wells and other sources are gathered through enogex s gas gathering systems and delivered to processing plants for the extraction of natural gas liquids 
during  gathering connected new producing wells  located in the anadarko and arkoma basins of oklahoma  to its gathering systems 
the company provides connection  measurement  treating  dehydration and compression services for various types of producing wells owned by various sized producers who are active in the region 
where the quality of natural gas received dictates that removal of natural gas liquids may be in order  such gas is aggregated via the gathering system to the inlet of one or more of the company s fleet of processing plants operated by products 
the resulting processed stream of natural gas is then delivered via the enogex pipeline system to one or more delivery points into the web of transmission pipelines in the region 
products is one of the largest gas processors in oklahoma  operating six natural gas processing plants with a total inlet capacity of mmcfd 
during  products had ownership interests in two other gas processing plants related to the nustar joint venture  which were sold in february products has been active since in the processing of natural gas and extraction and marketing of natural gas liquids 
the liquids extracted include condensate  marketable ethane  propane  butanes and natural gasoline mix 
the residue gas remaining after the liquid products have been extracted consists primarily of ethane and methane 
in  approximately million gallons of natural gas liquids were sold 
enogex also had a lease for a small segment of gathering pipeline off of the palo duro pipeline system  referred to as the northeast lateral 
this lease expired february  at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s gathering and processing business was approximately million 
approximately percent of the commercial grade propane processed at products plants is sold on the local market 
the balance of propane and the other natural gas liquids produced by products are delivered into pipeline facilities of a third party and transported to conway  kansas and mont belvieu  texas  where they are sold under contract or on the spot market 
ethane  which may be optionally produced at all of products plants except one  is sold in the spot market 
during  enogex initiated steps to decrease the volatility of its earnings stream by reducing its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
keep whole processing arrangements generally require a processor of natural gas to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis by replacing the btu of the liquids extracted from the well stream with natural gas at market prices 
therefore  if natural gas prices increase and liquids prices do not increase by a corresponding amount  processing margins are negatively affected 
in order to minimize the negative impact on processing margins  ethane and propane are rejected based upon then current market conditions 
exposure to these keep whole processing arrangements was reduced  but not eliminated  through contract renegotiations and changes in the soc that provides for a default processing fee in the event the natural gas liquids revenue less the associated fuel and shrinkage costs is negative 
in addition  the company actively monitors current and future commodity prices for opportunities to hedge its processing margin 
enogex uses forward physical sales and financial instruments to capture these spreads 
enogex is also in the construction phase of a project to expand its gathering pipeline capacity on the west side of its system 
this project is expected to be in service before september this expansion initiative should enable enogex to benefit from economic growth opportunities in that marketplace 
competition 
enogex competes with gatherers of all types and sizes  including those affiliated with various producers  other major pipeline companies  as well as various independent gatherers 
in processing and marketing natural gas liquids  products competes against virtually all other gas processors producing and selling natural gas liquids 
competition for natural gas supply is based on efficiency and reliability of operations  reputation  access to markets and pricing 
enogex believes it will be able to continue to compete effectively 
with respect to the profitability of the natural gas processing industry generally  if the price of natural gas liquids falls without a corresponding decrease in the cost of natural gas  it may become uneconomical to extract certain natural gas liquids 
this factor has had a significant adverse impact on the results of enogex in the past  but  as discussed above  the potential adverse impact has been materially mitigated  but not entirely eliminated 
in addition to the commodity pricing impact that affects the entire industry  the profitability of products is also largely affected by the volume of natural gas processed at its plants which is highly dependent upon the volume and btu content of natural gas gathered 
generally  if the volume of natural gas gathered increases  then the volume of natural gas liquids extracted by products should also increase 
marketing general 
enogex s commodity sales and services related to natural gas are conducted primarily through its subsidiary  oge energy resources  inc oeri 
oeri is engaged in the business of natural gas marketing 
oeri provides marketing services to enogex for natural gas volumes purchased at the wellhead from customers 
as a service to the producers on the enogex system  enogex may agree to purchase the gas at the wellhead in conjunction with gathering their gas for transportation to other markets 
oeri also purchases and sells natural gas pursuant to contracts with enogex and products relating to enogex s gathering  processing and storage assets 
at december   the net property  plant and equipment balance for enogex s marketing business was approximately million 
oeri focuses on serving customers along the natural gas value chain  from producers to end users  by purchasing natural gas from suppliers and reselling to pipelines  local distribution companies and end users  including the electric generation sector 
the geographic scope of marketing efforts has been focused largely in the mid continent area of the united states 
these markets are natural extensions of oeri s business on the enogex system 
oeri contracts for pipeline capacity with enogex and other pipelines to access multiple interconnections with the interstate pipeline system network that moves natural gas from the production basins primarily in the south central united states to the major consumption areas in chicago  new york and other north central and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
in  oeri implemented a refocused strategy that seeks to minimize the amount of capital employed and to complement better the natural gas pipeline business 
oeri has expanded into the gulf coast and rocky mountain markets to diversify its business and to facilitate enogex s business development efforts 
oeri primarily participates in both intermediate term markets less than three years and short term spot markets for natural gas 
although oeri continues to increase its focus on intermediate term sales  short term sales of natural gas are expected to continue to play a critical role in the overall strategy because they provide an important source of market intelligence as well as an important portfolio balancing function 
oeri s average daily sales volumes dropped from approximately bcf in to bcf in this reflects selective deal execution to assure adequate margin in light of credit and other risks in the current high commodity price environment 
oeri s risk management skills afford its customers the opportunity to tailor the risk profile and composition of their natural gas portfolio 
the company follows a policy of hedging price risk on gas purchases or sales contracts entered into by oeri by buying and selling natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange futures exchange and other derivatives in the over the counter market  subject to daily and monthly trading stop loss limits of million and daily value at risk limits of million in accordance with corporate policies 
oeri and cheyenne plains gas pipeline company  llc are parties to a firm transportation services agreement dated april  the cheyenne plains pipeline provides interstate gas transportation services in wyoming  colorado and kansas with a capacity of  dth day 
effective january   the capacity on the cheyenne plains pipeline increased to  dth day 
oeri reserved  dth day of firm capacity on the cheyenne plains pipeline for years 
such reservation provides oeri access to significant additional natural gas supplies in the rocky mountain production basins 
oeri pays a demand fee of approximately million annually for this capacity 
oeri incurred a loss of approximately million during related to its cheyenne plains position as a result of unfavorable market conditions for the capacity primarily due to the earlier than expected in service date for the project and the associated lack of upstream gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to deliver gas to the cheyenne hub for if the market conditions reflected in the current forward market price quotes continue for  oeri expects to record a loss of approximately million in competition 
oeri competes in marketing natural gas with major integrated oil companies  marketing affiliates of major interstate and intrastate pipelines and commercial banks  national and local natural gas brokers  marketers and distributors for natural gas supplies 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on reputation  credit support  the availability of gathering and transportation to high demand markets and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for the producer s natural gas 
competition for sales to customers is based primarily upon reliability  services offered and the price of delivered natural gas 
for the year ended december   approximately percent of oeri s service volumes were with electric utilities  local gas distribution companies  pipelines and producers 
the remaining percent of service volumes were to marketers  municipals  cooperatives and industrials 
at december   approximately percent of the payment exposure was to companies having investment grade ratings with standard poor s ratings services standard poor s and approximately percent having less than investment grade ratings 
the remaining percent of oeri s exposure is with privately held companies  municipals or cooperatives that were not rated by standard poor s 
oeri applies internal credit analyses and policies to these non rated companies 
finance and construction future capital requirements capital requirements the company s primary needs for capital are related to replacing or expanding existing facilities in og e s electric utility business and replacing or expanding existing facilities including technology at enogex 
other working capital requirements are primarily related to maturing debt  operating lease obligations  hedging activities  natural gas storage and delays in recovering unconditional fuel purchase obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper and permanent financings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements for a discussion of the company s capital requirements 
capital expenditures the company s current to construction program includes continued investment in og e s and enogex s assets 
og e plans to continue to invest in its electric system at a level consistent with these capital expenditures do not include any capital requirements associated with og e s proposed wind power project pending approval from the occ 
og e has approximately mw s of contracts with qualified cogeneration facilities qf and small power production producers qf contracts that will expire at the end of  unless extended by og e 
for one of these qf contracts  og e purchases percent of electricity generated by the qf 
for the other qf contract  og e can purchase up to percent of electricity generated by the qf 
in addition  effective september   og e entered into a new year power purchase agreement for mw s with powersmith cogeneration project  lp powersmith  in which og e purchases percent of electricity generated by powersmith 
og e will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers  including exercising its options if applicable to extend these qf contracts at pre determined rates 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units as well as wind generation facilities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements for a discussion of the company s capital expenditures 
pension and postretirement benefit plans during and  the company made contributions to its pension plan of approximately million and million  respectively  to ensure that the pension plan maintains an adequate funded status 
during  the company may contribute up to million to the pension plan 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital requirements for a discussion of the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds  long and short term debt and proceeds from the sales of common stock pursuant to the company s automatic dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated cash needs 
the company utilizes short term borrowings through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper to satisfy temporary working capital needs and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged 
short term debt short term borrowings generally are used to meet working capital requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a table showing the company s lines of credit in place  commercial paper and available cash at december  at december   the company s short term borrowings consisted of commercial paper 
environmental matters approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company s management believes that all of its operations are in substantial compliance with present federal  state and local environmental standards 
it is estimated that the company s total expenditures for capital  operating  maintenance and other costs to preserve and enhance environmental quality will be approximately million during as compared to approximately million in the company continues to evaluate its environmental management systems to ensure compliance with existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and to better position itself in a competitive market

risk factors 
in the discussion of risk factors set forth below  unless the context otherwise requires  the terms oge energy  we  our and us refer to oge energy corp  og e refers to our subsidiary oklahoma gas and electric company and enogex refers to our subsidiary enogex inc and its subsidiaries 
in addition to the other information in this k and other documents filed by us and or our subsidiaries with the sec from time to time  the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating oge energy and its subsidiaries 
such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us or our subsidiaries 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business operations 
regulatory risks our profitability depends to a large extent on the ability of og e to fully recover its costs from its customers and there may be changes in the regulatory environment that impair its ability to recover costs from its customers 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state utility regulatory agencies  which significantly influences our operating environment and og e s ability to fully recover its costs from utility customers 
with rising fuel costs  recoverability of under recovered amounts from our customers is a significant risk 
the utility commissions in the states where og e operates regulate many aspects of our utility operations including siting and construction of facilities  customer service and the rates that we can charge customers 
the profitability of our utility operations is dependent on our ability to fully recover costs related to providing energy and utility services to our customers 
on may   og e filed for an million annual rate increase to recover investments in our electric system  including those related to our mcclain plant 
several parties made filings recommending a significantly lower increase and  in certain cases  rate decreases 
on december   the occ issued an order providing for a million rate increase in og e s electric rates which became effective in january this rate order will require us to reduce planned electric system upgrades and expansion projects  and we are considering when to return to the occ to seek further rate relief 
we cannot assure you that the occ will grant us rate increases in the future or in the amounts we request  and it could instead lower our rates 
in recent years  the regulatory environments in which we operate have received an increased amount of public attention 
it is possible that there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair our ability to fully recover costs historically absorbed by our customers 
state utility commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met 
we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of the agencies that regulate us 
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
og e s rates are subject to regulation by the states of oklahoma and arkansas  as well as by a federal agency  whose regulatory paradigms and goals may not be consistent 
og e is currently a vertically integrated electric utility and most of its revenue results from the sale of electricity to retail customers subject to bundled rates that are approved by the applicable state utility commission and the sale of electricity to wholesale customers subject to rates and other matters approved by the ferc 
og e operates in oklahoma and western arkansas and is subject to regulation by the occ and the apsc  in addition to the ferc 
exposure to inconsistent state and federal regulatory standards may limit our ability to operate profitably 
further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  wildlife mortality  natural resources and health and safety that could  among other things  restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production of electricity and or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs 
there are significant capital  operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes  rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future 
og e s results of operations could be affected by og e s ability to renegotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in oklahoma 
og e has several franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in oklahoma and og e s ability to renegotiate these agreements may affect our results of operations and financial position 
the regional power market in which og e operates has changing transmission regulatory structures  which may affect the transmission assets and related revenues and expenses 
og e currently owns and operates transmission facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility 
og e is a member of the spp regional transmission organization rto and has transferred operational authority but not ownership of og e s transmission facilities to the spp rto 
the spp rto is planning to develop and operate a regional market for trading in electric energy 
because it remains unclear how and when the spp rto will implement the market or what new market rules it will establish  we are unable to assess fully the impact that these developments may have on our business 
og e s revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities may be adversely affected by changes in the organization  operation and regulation by the ferc or the spp rto 
og e s settlement agreement with the occ relating to its rate case targets million of savings over a three year period from the acquisition of new generation 
og e may not be able to achieve such targeted savings  in which case  og e will be required to credit any unrealized savings to its oklahoma customers 
as part of og e s settlement agreement in november  og e indicated that the acquisition of up to mw s of new generation through the purchase of a percent in the mcclain plant should provide million of savings to our customers over three years 
og e also agreed that if it is unable to demonstrate such savings  it will credit its customers any unrealized savings below million 
we cannot assure you that og e will be able to realize the targeted million of savings to its customers  in which case  og e will be required to credit unrealized savings to its oklahoma customers 
increased competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have a significant financial impact on us and og e and consequently decrease our revenue 
we have been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility and energy industries 
significant changes already have occurred and additional changes have been proposed to the wholesale electric market 
although retail restructuring efforts in oklahoma and arkansas have been postponed for the time being  if such efforts were renewed  retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on us due to an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins and or increased costs of capital 
any such restructuring could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot predict when we will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation  nor can we predict the impact of these changes on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that the prices for electricity and the quality and reliability of our service currently place us in a position to compete effectively in the energy market 
recent events that are beyond our control have increased the level of public and regulatory scrutiny of our industry 
governmental and market reactions to these events may have negative impacts on our business  financial condition and access to capital 
as a result of the energy crisis in california during the summer of  the volatility of natural gas prices in north america  the bankruptcy filing by enron corporation  accounting irregularities at public companies in general  and energy companies in particular  and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities  companies in the regulated and unregulated utility business have been under an increased amount of public and regulatory scrutiny and suspicion 
the accounting irregularities have caused regulators and legislators to review current accounting practices  financial disclosures and relationships between corporations and their independent auditors 
the capital markets and rating agencies also have increased their level of scrutiny 
we believe that we are complying with all applicable laws and accounting standards  but it is difficult or impossible to predict or control what effect these types of events may have on our business  financial condition or access to the capital markets 
as a result of these events  congress passed the sarbanes oxley act of it is unclear what additional laws or regulations may develop  and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies  the energy industry or our operations specifically 
any new accounting standards could affect the way we are required to record revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
these changes in accounting standards could lead to negative impacts on reported earnings or increases in liabilities that could  in turn  affect our reported results of operations 
we are subject to substantial utility and energy regulation by governmental agencies 
compliance with current and future utility and energy regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals  permits and certifications may result in significant costs to us 
we are subject to substantial regulation from federal  state and local regulatory agencies 
we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of our businesses  including customer rates  service regulations  retail service territories  sales of securities  asset acquisitions and sales  accounting policies and practices and the operation of generating facilities 
we believe the necessary permits  approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from future regulatory activities of these agencies 
operations risks our results of operations may be impacted by disruptions beyond our control 
we are exposed to risks related to performance of contractual obligations by our suppliers 
we are dependent on coal for much of our electric generating capacity 
we rely on suppliers to deliver coal in accordance with short and long term contracts 
we have certain coal supply contracts in place  however  there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal to us 
the suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
in addition  the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal to us under certain circumstances  such as in the event of a natural disaster 
coal delivery may be subject to short term interruptions or reductions due to various factors  including transportation problems  weather and availability of equipment 
failure or delay by our suppliers of coal deliveries could disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and require us to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  as agreements with our suppliers expire  we may not be able to enter into new agreements for coal delivery on equivalent terms 
also  because our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid  we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption or black out caused by an event severe storm  generator or transmission facility outage on a neighboring system or the actions of a neighboring utility  similar to the august  black out in portions of the eastern us and canada 
any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair assets  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
weather conditions such as tornadoes  thunderstorms  ice storms  wind storms  as well as seasonal temperature variations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electric power 
in og e s service area  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also typically peaking at that time 
as a result  overall operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
in addition  we have historically sold less power  and consequently received less revenue  when weather conditions are milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could reduce our revenues  net income  available cash and borrowing ability 
severe weather  such as tornadoes  thunderstorms  ice storms and wind storms  may cause outages and property damage which may require us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers 
the effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned  as described above  would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period 
financial and market risks increasing costs associated with our defined benefit retirement plans  health care plans and other employee related benefits may adversely affect our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
we have defined benefit and postretirement plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
assumptions related to future costs  returns on investments  interest rates and other actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on our earnings and funding requirements 
based on our assumptions at december  and assuming continuation of the current federal interest rate relief beyond  in order to maintain minimum funding levels for our pension plans  we expect to continue to make future contributions to maintain required funding levels 
it is our practice to also make voluntary contributions to maintain more prudent funding levels than minimally required 
these amounts are estimates and may change based on actual stock market performance  changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations 
in addition to the costs of our retirement plans  the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased substantially in recent years 
we believe that our employee benefit costs  including costs related to health care plans for our employees and former employees  will continue to rise 
the increasing costs and funding requirements with our defined benefit retirement plan  health care plans and other employee benefits may adversely affect our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
we are a holding company with our primary assets being investments in our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets 
substantially all of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries 
consequently  our operating cash flow and our ability to pay our dividends and service our indebtedness depends upon the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends 
at december   we had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities of approximately billion 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our indebtedness or to make any funds available for that purpose  whether by dividends or otherwise 
in addition  each subsidiary s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any statutory and contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such subsidiary  which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and other assets 
claims of creditors  including general creditors  of our subsidiaries on the assets of these subsidiaries will have priority over our claims generally except to the extent that we may be a creditor of the subsidiaries and our claims are recognized and claims by our shareowners 
in addition  as discussed above  og e is regulated by state utility commissions in oklahoma and arkansas which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met 
to the extent that the state commissions attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of og e to pay dividends to us  it could adversely affect our ability to continue to pay dividends 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness  which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness 
the terms of the indentures governing our debt securities do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
if we or our subsidiaries are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our revolving credit agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness 
if we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness  the related risks that we and they now face may intensify 
certain provisions in our charter documents and rights plan have anti takeover effects 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as the oklahoma corporations statute  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of oge energy 
such provisions  including those regulating the nomination of directors  limiting who may call special stockholders meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent  together with the possible issuance of preferred stock of oge energy without stockholder approval  may make it more difficult for other persons  without the approval of our board of directors  to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder s best interest 
additionally  our rights plan may also delay  defer or prevent a change of control of oge energy 
under the rights plan  each outstanding share of common stock has one half of a right attached that trades with the common stock 
absent prior action by our board of directors to redeem the rights or amend the rights plan  upon the consummation of certain acquisition transactions  the rights would entitle the holder thereof other than the acquiror to purchase shares of common stock at a discounted price in a manner designed to result in substantial dilution to the acquiror 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock  discourage third party bidders from bidding for us and could significantly impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management 
any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships 
we cannot assure you that any of our current ratings or our subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any future downgrade could increase the cost of short term borrowings but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the rating changes 
any downgrade could lead to higher borrowing costs and  if below investment grade  could require us to issue guarantees on behalf of enogex to support some of oeri s marketing operations 
we are subject to commodity price risk 
we are exposed to commodity price risk in our generation  retail distribution  pipeline and energy trading operations 
to minimize the risk of commodity prices  we may enter into physical or financial derivative instrument contracts to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas  distillate fuel oil  electricity  coal and emission allowances 
however  financial derivative instrument contracts do not eliminate the risk 
specifically  such risks include commodity price changes  market supply shortages and interest rate changes 
the impact of these variables could result in our inability to fulfill contractual obligations  significantly higher energy or fuel costs relative to corresponding sales contracts or increased interest expense 
however  exposure to commodity price risk related to og e s retail customers is partially mitigated by its fuel adjustment clause  although we cannot assure you that all increases in our commodity prices  including fuel costs  will be completely recovered  or that any such recovery will be timely 
we are also exposed to volatility from our exposure to keep whole processing arrangements 
keep whole processing arrangements generally require a processor of natural gas to keep its shippers whole on a btu basis by replacing the btu of the liquids extracted from the well stream with natural gas at market prices 
therefore  if natural gas prices increase and liquids prices do not increase by a corresponding amount  processing margins are negatively affected 
in order to minimize the negative impact on processing margins  ethane and propane are rejected based upon then current market conditions 
exposure to these keep whole processing arrangements was reduced  but not eliminated  through contract renegotiations and changes in the soc that provides for a default processing fee in the event the natural gas liquids revenue less the associated fuel and shrinkage costs is negative 
in addition  the company actively monitors current and future commodity prices for opportunities to hedge its processing margin 
enogex uses forward physical sales and financial instruments to capture these spreads 
despite these activities  we cannot assure that our exposure to keep whole processing arrangements has been eliminated 
we mark our energy trading portfolio to estimated fair market value on a daily basis mark to market accounting  which causes earnings variability 
market prices are utilized in determining the value of electric energy  natural gas and related derivative commodity instruments 
for longer term positions  which are limited to a maximum of months  and certain short term positions for which market prices are not available  models based on forward price curves are utilized 
these models incorporate estimates and assumptions as to a variety of factors such as pricing relationships between various energy commodities and geographic locations 
actual experience can vary significantly from these estimates and assumptions 
we are subject to credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risks in our generation  retail distribution  pipeline and energy trading operations 
credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations 
if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements 
in that event  our financial results could be adversely affected  and we could incur losses

regulatory matters gas transportation and storage agreement as part of the settlement of an og e rate case in november the settlement agreement  og e agreed to consider competitive bidding as a basis to select its provider for gas transportation service to its natural gas fired generation facilities pursuant to the terms set forth in the settlement agreement 
because the required integrated service was not available in the marketplace from parties other than enogex  og e advised the occ that  after careful consideration  competitive bidding for gas transportation was rejected in favor of a new intrastate integrated  firm no notice load following gas transportation and storage services agreement with enogex 
this seven year agreement provides for gas transportation and storage services for each of og e s natural gas fired generation facilities 
og e will pay enogex annual demand fees of approximately million for the right to transport specified maximum daily quantities mdq and maximum hourly quantities mhq of gas at various minimum gas delivery pressures depending on the operational needs of the individual generating facility 
in addition  og e supplies system fuel in kind for its pro rata share of actual fuel and lost and unaccounted for gas on the transportation system 
to the extent og e transports gas in quantities in excess of the prescribed mdq s or mhq s  it pays an overrun service charge 
during the years ended december   and  og e paid enogex approximately million  million and million  respectively  for gas transportation and storage services 
on july   the occ issued an order in this case approving a million annual recovery 
the occ order disallowed the recovery by og e of the amount that enogex charges og e for the cost of fuel used  or otherwise unaccounted for  in providing natural gas transportation and storage service to og e 
over the last three years  this amount has ranged from million to million annually 
this amount was approximately million in and is projected to be approximately million in the occ s order required og e to refund to its oklahoma customers the difference between the amounts collected from such customers in the past based on an annual rate of million for gas transportation and storage services and the million annual rate authorized by the occ s order 
based on the order  og e s refund obligation was approximately million

coal shipment disruption in july  og e received notification from union pacific railroad union pacific that  in may  union pacific and bnsf railway bnsf experienced successive derailments on the jointly owned rail line serving the southern powder river basin coal producers 
according to union pacific  these two derailments were caused by track that had become unstable from an accumulation of coal dust in the roadbed combined with unusually heavy rainfall 
bnsf  which maintains and operates the line  concluded that a significant part of the line needed to be repaired before normal train operations could resume 
while the repairs were taking place  union pacific was unable to operate at full capacity from the powder river basin 
in november  union pacific notified og e that the south powder river basin joint line force majeure condition that was declared in may had ended 
on december   bnsf completed the enhanced joint line maintenance program which opened the way for a return to normal operating conditions 
it is expected that as rail traffic improves  og e will be able to increase its level of coal inventories 
at december   og e had slightly more than days of coal supply for each of its coal fired units at its sooner and muskogee generating plants 
potential new enogex project on november   enogex announced that it had entered into a letter of intent with el paso corporation el paso that is designed to accelerate el paso s continental connector project 
the letter of intent contemplates arrangements by which el paso or an affiliate would execute an initial lease of up to  decatherms per day dth day of capacity on the enogex pipeline system  with an option to expand up to million dth day  so that the leased enogex pipeline capacity would become an integral part of the continental connector project 
the letter of intent also contemplates a commitment by enogex to secure up to  dth day of capacity subscriptions for the project 
these arrangements would significantly reduce the amount of new mainline construction required for the project  resulting in less environmental disturbance and an earlier in service target date of winter under the letter of intent  the continental connector project will use existing or expanded el paso pipeline systems to transport capacity constrained natural gas from rocky mountain and mid continent supply regions to custer  oklahoma 
at custer  this gas and local mid continent production will be transported on existing and expanded enogex systems for continental connector under a long term lease arrangement for re delivery in the vicinity of bennington  oklahoma 
from there  gas will be transported on new el paso pipeline facilities through the perryville  louisiana  hub to a termination with tennessee and southern natural pipelines at pugh  mississippi 
enogex intends to work with el paso to determine whether to advance this project 
however  the commitments and obligations under the letter of intent are subject to various conditions  including definitive documentation and boards of directors and regulatory approvals and there can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied 
pending satisfaction of these conditions  enogex does not expect to incur material expenditures

liquidity and capital requirements the company s primary needs for capital are related to replacing or expanding existing facilities in og e s electric utility business and replacing or expanding existing facilities including technology at enogex 
other working capital requirements are primarily related to maturing debt  operating lease obligations  hedging activities  natural gas storage and delays in recovering unconditional fuel purchase obligations 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper and permanent financings

b includes expected recoveries of costs incurred for og e s railcar operating lease obligations and og e s unconditional fuel purchase obligations 
n a not available variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation which includes the operating lease obligations for og e s railcar leases shown above and certain purchased power costs  as compared to the fuel component included in the cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
accordingly  while the cost of fuel related to operating leases and the vast majority of unconditional fuel purchase obligations of og e noted above may increase capital requirements  such costs are recoverable through automatic fuel adjustment clauses and have little  if any  impact on net capital requirements and future contractual obligations 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the apsc and the ferc 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the completed proceedings at the occ regarding og e s gas transportation and storage contract with enogex 
capital requirements and financing activities total capital requirements  consisting of capital expenditures  maturities of long term debt  interest payments on long term debt and pension funding obligations  were approximately million and contractual obligations  net of recoveries through automatic fuel adjustment clauses  were approximately million resulting in total net capital requirements and contractual obligations of approximately million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to net capital requirements of approximately million and net contractual obligations of approximately million totaling approximately million in  of which approximately million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  short term borrowings through a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper and proceeds from the sale of assets 
the company uses its commercial paper to fund changes in working capital and as an interim source of financing capital expenditures until permanent financing is arranged 
changes in working capital reflect the seasonal nature of the company s business  the revenue lag between billing and collection from customers and fuel inventories 
see financial condition for a discussion of significant changes in net working capital requirements as it pertains to operating cash flow and liquidity 
discontinued operations also contributing to the liquidity of the company has been the disposition of certain assets classified as discontinued operations in during  these dispositions have generated net sales proceeds of approximately million

future capital requirements capital expenditures the company s current to construction program includes continued investment in og e s and enogex s assets 
to reliably meet the increased electricity needs of og e s customers during the foreseeable future  og e will continue to invest to maintain the integrity of the delivery system 
approximately million of the company s capital expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
og e plans to continue to invest in its electric system at a level consistent with these capital expenditures do not include any capital requirements associated with og e s proposed wind power project pending approval from the occ 
og e has approximately mw s of qf contracts that will expire at the end of  unless extended by og e 
for one of these qf contracts  og e purchases percent of electricity generated by the qf 
for the other qf contract  og e can purchase up to percent of electricity generated by the qf 
in addition  effective september   og e entered into a new year power purchase agreement for mw s with powersmith cogeneration project  lp powersmith  in which og e purchases percent of electricity generated by powersmith 
og e will continue reviewing all of the supply alternatives to these expiring qf contracts that minimize the total cost of generation to its customers  including exercising its options if applicable to extend these qf contracts at pre determined rates 
accordingly  og e will continue to explore opportunities to build or buy power plants in order to serve its native load 
as a result of the high volatility of current natural gas prices and the increase in natural gas prices  og e will also assess the feasibility of constructing additional base load coal fired units as well as wind generation facilities 
refinancing of long term debt in august  og e filed a form s registration statement to register the sale of up to million of og e s unsecured debt securities 
on october   og e paid at maturity its million of percent senior notes and redeemed its million of percent senior notes due october  at the principal amount plus a million premium 
the repayments were funded temporarily through the issuance of commercial paper by the company and og e and borrowings under existing credit agreements which og e replaced with the proceeds from the issuance of million of percent senior notes and million of percent senior notes in january pension and postretirement benefit plans during  actual asset returns for the company s defined benefit pension plan were positively affected by growth in the equity markets  however  the growth in was not as strong as the growth in the equity markets in at december   approximately percent of the pension plan assets are invested in listed common stocks with the balance invested in corporate debt and us government securities 
in  asset returns on the pension plan were approximately percent as compared to approximately percent in during the same time  corporate bond yields  which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations  have continued to decline 
contributions to the pension plan decreased from approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease in pension plan funding in was due to the fact that in prior years additional amounts were contributed to the pension plan to maintain an adequate funded status 
during  the company may contribute up to million to the pension plan 
the level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets and increases in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the plan 
legislation is before congress that if passed would change the funding requirements for defined benefit plans 
the proposed legislation would generally provide employers less funding flexibility and require a higher funding level than required under current regulations 
management will continue to monitor the outcome of the legislation 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in the company made several changes to its pension plan  including the adoption of a cash balance benefit feature for employees hired after january  the cash balance plan may provide lower post employment pension benefits to employees  which could result in less pension expense being recorded 
over the near term  the company s cash requirements for the plan are not expected to be materially different than the requirements existing prior to the plan changes 
however  as the population of employees included in the cash balance plan feature increases  the company s cash requirements should decrease and will be much less sensitive to changes in discount rates 
during and  the company made contributions to the pension plan and the restoration of retirement income plan that exceeded amounts previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a net prepaid benefit obligation at december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the company s projected pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets and the restoration of retirement income plan assets by approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of recording a prepaid benefit obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets  provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and the offset of this entry was an intangible asset and accumulated other comprehensive income  net of a deferred tax asset  therefore  this adjustment did not impact the results of operations in or and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the amount recorded as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the remainder recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income represents a net periodic pension cost to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income in future periods

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material affect on the company s consolidated financial statements particularly as they relate to pension expense and impairment estimates

in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of pension plan assumptions  impairment estimates  contingency reserves  accrued removal obligations  regulatory assets and liabilities  unbilled revenue for og e  operating revenues for enogex  natural gas purchases for enogex  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the valuation of energy purchase and sale contracts and fair value and cash flow hedging policies 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
consolidated including electric utility and natural gas pipeline segments pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and the level of funding 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the pension plan rate assumptions are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the plan assets portfolio 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
the level of funding is dependent on returns on plan assets and future discount rates 
higher returns on plan assets and an increase in discount rates will reduce funding requirements to the plan 
the following table indicates the sensitivity of the pension plans funded status to these variables 
change impact on funded status actual plan asset returns percent million discount rate percent million contributions million million expected long term return on plan assets percent none the company assesses potential impairments of assets or asset groups when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances require an analysis of the recoverability of an asset or asset group 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets shall be grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset or asset group shall include only the future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
the fair value of these assets is based on third party evaluations  prices for similar assets  historical data and projected cash flow 
an impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the amount of any recognized impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset 
enogex expects to continue to evaluate the strategic fit and financial performance of each of its assets in an effort to ensure a proper economic allocation of resources 
the magnitude and timing of any potential impairment or gain on the disposition of any assets have not been included in the earnings guidance 
in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with legal counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  in which an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation aro that is conditional on a future event if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional aro should be recognized when incurred 
uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement of a conditional aro should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
however  in some cases  there is insufficient information to estimate the fair value of an aro 
in these cases  the liability should be initially recognized in the period in which sufficient information is available for an entity to make a reasonable estimate of the liability s fair value 
fin required both recognition of a cumulative change in accounting principle and disclosure of the liability on a pro forma basis for transition purposes 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted this new interpretation effective december  which resulted in an aro of approximately million being recorded for power plant structure legal obligations associated with various removal items  of which approximately million is the aro and approximately million are cumulative accretion costs 
beginning january   the company will amortize the remaining value of the related aro assets over their remaining lives ranging from to years 
the cumulative accretion costs of approximately million that are included in the aro were reclassified from the regulatory liability account associated with accrued removal obligations to asset retirement obligations on the consolidated balance sheet and  as a result  there was no earnings impact from a cumulative effect adjustment due to a change in accounting principle 
in addition  the cumulative depreciation expense for the aro assets of approximately that would have been recorded for the time period from the date the liability would have been originally recorded under fin was also reclassified from the regulatory liability account to accumulated depreciation for the aro assets with no earnings impact 
at december  and  the pro forma amount of the aro would have been approximately million 
the company has identified other aro s that have not been recorded because the company determined that these assets have indefinite lives primarily related to og e s power plant sites and enogex s processing plants 
og e and enogex engage in cash flow and fair value hedge transactions to modify the rate composition of the debt portfolio 
enogex also engages in cash flow and fair value hedge transactions to manage commodity risk 
enogex may hedge its forward exposure to manage changes in commodity prices 
anticipated transactions are documented as cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  hedging requirements and are executed based upon management established price targets 
during  oeri also utilized fair value hedges under sfas no 
to manage commodity price exposure for natural gas storage inventory 
however  during and  oeri decided not to utilize hedge accounting under sfas no 
for natural gas storage inventory 
hedges are evaluated prior to execution with respect to the impact on the volatility of forecasted earnings and are evaluated at least quarterly after execution for the impact on earnings 
og e and enogex have entered into interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements relating to managing interest rate exposure on the debt portfolio or anticipated debt issuances to modify the interest rate exposure on fixed rate debt issues 
these interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements qualify as fair value or cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the objective of the interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
the objective of the treasury lock agreements was to protect against the variability of future payments of interest expense of debt that was issued by og e in january electric utility segment og e  as a regulated utility  is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by the sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
provides that certain actual or anticipated costs that would otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets  based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates 
likewise  certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities  based on the expected flowback to customers in future rates 
management s expected recovery of deferred costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment 
og e records certain actual or anticipated costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if it is probable  based on regulatory orders or other available evidence  that the cost or obligation will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refund in future rates 
og e reads its customers meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month 
as a result  there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that has not been billed at the end of each month 
unbilled revenue is presented in accrued unbilled revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income based on estimates of usage and prices during the period 
at december   if the estimated usage or price used in the unbilled revenue calculation were to increase or decrease by one percent  this would cause a change in the unbilled revenues recognized of approximately million 
at december  and  accrued unbilled revenues were approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to be paid by customers 
customer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after the final billing date 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision rate 
the provision rate is based on a month historical average of actual balances written off 
to the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of future collections  there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense recognized 
at december   if the provision rate were to increase or decrease by percent  this would cause a change in the uncollectible expense recognized of approximately million 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
natural gas pipeline segment operating revenues for transportation  storage  gathering and processing services for enogex are recorded each month based on the current month s estimated volumes  current commodity prices  historical seasonal fluctuations and any known adjustments 
the estimates are reversed in the following month and customers are billed on actual volumes and contracted prices 
gas sales are calculated on current month nominations and contracted prices 
operating revenues associated with the production of natural gas liquids are estimated based on current month estimated production and contracted prices 
these amounts are reversed in the following month and the customers are billed on actual production and contracted prices 
estimated operating revenues are reflected in accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
estimates for gas purchases are based on sales volumes and contracted purchase prices 
estimated gas purchases are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
oeri s activities include the marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the vast majority of these contracts expire within three years  which is when the cash aspect of the transactions will be realized 
a substantial portion of these contracts qualify as derivatives under sfas no 
and are marked to market with offsetting gains and losses recorded in earnings 
in nearly all cases  independent market prices are obtained and compared to the values used for this mark to market valuation  and an oversight group outside of the marketing organization monitors all modeling methodologies and assumptions 
the recorded value of the energy contracts may change significantly in the future as the market price for the commodity changes  but the value is still subject to the risk loss limitations provided under the company s risk policies 
the company utilizes models to estimate the fair value of its energy contracts including derivatives that do not have an independent market price 
at december   unrealized mark to market gains were approximately million  which included approximately million of unrealized mark to market gains that were calculated utilizing models 
at december   a price movement of one percent for prices verified by independent parties would result in changes in unrealized mark to market gains of approximately million and a price movement of five percent on model based prices would result in changes in unrealized mark to market gains of approximately million 
energy contracts are presented in price risk management assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
natural gas inventory used in enogex s business is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
in order to minimize risk  oeri enters into contracts or hedging instruments to hedge the fair value of this inventory 
oeri has elected not to designate inventory hedging contracts as fair value or cash flow hedges under sfas no 
the fair value of the hedging instruments is recorded on the books of oeri as a price risk management asset or liability with an offsetting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
as part of its recurring business activity  oeri injects and withdraws natural gas under the terms of storage capacity contracts 
the amount of enogex s natural gas inventory was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
natural gas storage inventory is presented in fuel inventories on the consolidated balance sheets and in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is calculated based on outstanding accounts receivable balances over days old 
in addition  other outstanding accounts receivable balances less than days old are reserved on a case by case basis when the company believes the required payment of specific amounts owed is unlikely to occur 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is a reduction to accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and is included in other operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for the natural gas pipeline segment was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the company 
electric competition  regulation og e and enogex have been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility and energy industries 
significant changes already have occurred and additional changes are being proposed to the wholesale electric market 
although retail restructuring efforts in oklahoma and arkansas have been postponed for the time being  if such efforts were renewed  retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on the company due to an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins and or increased costs of capital 
any such restructuring could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company cannot predict when it will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation  nor can it predict the impact of these changes on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company believes that the prices for electricity and the quality and reliability of the company s service currently place us in a position to compete effectively in the energy market 
these developments at the federal and state levels as well as pending regulatory matters affecting the company are described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business  the company is confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims made by third parties  environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies 
management consults with legal counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if in management s opinion  the company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management  after consultation with legal counsel  does not currently anticipate that liabilities arising out of these pending or threatened lawsuits  claims and contingencies will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks are  in most cases  risks that are actively traded in a marketplace and have been well studied in regards to quantification 
market risks include  but are not limited to  commodity prices  commodity price and interest rates 
the company is exposed to commodity price and commodity price volatility risks in its operations 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term variable rate debt  interest rate swap agreements and commercial paper 
the company also engages in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading purposes 
risk committees and oversight the company monitors market risks using a risk committee structure 
the risk oversight committee  which consists primarily of corporate officers  is responsible for the overall development  implementation and enforcement of strategies and policies for all risk management activities of the company 
this committee s emphasis is a holistic perspective of risk measurement and policies targeting the company s overall financial performance 
the risk oversight committee is authorized by and reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the unregulated business unit risk management committee is comprised primarily of business unit leaders within enogex 
this committee s purpose is to develop and maintain risk policies for enogex  to provide oversight and guidance for existing and prospective enogex business activities and to provide governance regarding compliance with enogex risk policies 
this group is authorized by and reports to the risk oversight committee 
the company also has a corporate risk management department led by our chief risk and compliance officer 
this group  in conjunction with the aforementioned committees  is responsible for establishing and enforcing the company s risk policies 
risk policies the company utilizes risk policies to control the amount of market risk exposure 
these policies  which include value at risk var limits  position limits  tenor limits and stop loss limits  are designed to provide the audit committee of the board of directors and senior executives of the company with confidence that the risks taken on by the company s business activities are in accordance with their expectations for financial returns and that the approved policies and controls related to risk management are being followed 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term debt  interest rate swap agreements and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
fair value hedges at december   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the company had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements that qualified as fair value hedges i og e entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective march   to convert million of percent fixed rate debt due october   to a variable rate based on the three month london interbank offering rate libor and ii enogex entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements  effective july  and october   to convert a total of million million for each interest rate swap agreement of percent fixed rate debt due january   to a variable rate based on the six month libor in arrears 
the objective of these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage of total corporate long term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with industry standards 
these interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under sfas no 
and met all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective portion as allowed by the shortcut method under sfas no 
on april   enogex terminated two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million and received approximately million related to this transaction 
since inception of the enogex interest rate swap agreements  which converted million of percent fixed rate debt due january  to a floating rate based upon the three and six month libor  the company has paid approximately million in interest and has received approximately million related to these agreements 
the effective interest rate until maturity will be approximately percent on this long term debt 
on september   the counterparty to og e s interest rate swap agreement exercised its right to change the termination date of the interest rate swap agreement from october  to october  in conjunction with the early redemption of long term debt discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   og e received approximately million related to the termination of its interest rate agreement of which approximately million is related to interest received and approximately million is related to canceling the interest rate swap agreement  which will be amortized over the life of the long term debt og e issued in january at december   the fair values pursuant to the interest rate swaps were approximately million and the hedges were classified as deferred charges and other assets price risk management in the consolidated balance sheet 
a corresponding net increase of approximately million was reflected in long term debt at december  as these fair value hedges were effective at december  cash flow hedges of interest rates og e entered into two separate treasury lock agreements  effective november  and november   respectively  to hedge approximately million each of future interest payments of long term debt that was issued in january these treasury locks were terminated in early december due to the lack of an occ order in og e s rate case at the time 
og e entered into two separate treasury lock agreements  effective december   to hedge approximately million each of future interest payments of long term debt that was issued in january these treasury locks were terminated on january  after og e issued long term debt 
og e received less than million related to the termination of the aforementioned treasury lock agreements 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues with similar maturities 
at december   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the following table shows the company s long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
dollars in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt a principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt b principal amount weighted average interest rate a prior to or when these debt obligations mature  the company may refinance all or a portion of such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
b a hypothetical change of basis points in the underlying variable interest rate would increase interest expense by approximately million annually 
the company s price risk management assets and liabilities as of december  were as follows dollars in millions commodity notional volume mmbtu maturity fair value trading price risk management assets physical purchases natural gas physical purchases natural gas total physical purchases physical sales natural gas long physical options natural gas short physical options natural gas long financial swaps excluding basis natural gas short financial swaps excluding basis natural gas short financial options natural gas long basis positions natural gas short basis positions natural gas short basis positions natural gas total short basis positions trading price risk management liabilities physical purchases natural gas physical sales natural gas physical sales natural gas total physical sales short physical options natural gas long financial swaps excluding basis natural gas short financial swaps excluding basis natural gas long financial options natural gas long basis positions natural gas long basis positions natural gas total long basis positions short basis positions natural gas non trading price risk management assets long financial swaps excluding basis natural gas long basis positions natural gas short basis positions natural gas non trading price risk management liabilities long financial swaps excluding basis natural gas long basis positions natural gas the valuation of the company s price risk management assets and liabilities were determined primarily based on quoted market prices 
however  in certain instances where market quotes are not available  other valuation techniques or models are used to estimate market values 
the valuation of instruments also considers the credit risk of the counterparties and the potential impact of liquidating the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time 
commodity price risk the market risks inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments  positions and anticipated commodity transactions are the potential losses in value arising from adverse changes in the commodity prices to which the company is exposed 
these market risks can be classified as trading  which includes transactions that are entered into voluntarily to capture subsequent changes in commodity prices  or non trading  which includes the exposure some of the company s assets have to commodity prices 
trading activities the trading activities are conducted throughout the year subject to daily and monthly trading stop loss limits of million 
the daily loss exposure from trading activities is measured primarily using var  which estimates the potential losses the trading activities could incur over a specified time horizon and confidence level 
the var limit for the company s trading activities  assuming a one day time horizon and percent confidence level  is million 
these limits are designed to mitigate the possibility of trading activities having a material adverse effect on the company s operating income 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk created by trading activities 
the value of trading positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows for in millions trading commodity market risk  net non trading activities the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and natural gas liquids processing spreads are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
the changes in these prices have a direct effect on the compensation received by the company for operating some of its assets 
to partially reduce non trading commodity price risk  the company hedges  through the utilization of derivatives and other forward transactions  the effects these market fluctuations have on the operating income of the company 
because the commodities covered by these hedges are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to the market risk of the company s non trading activities 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  commodity purchase and sales contracts  financial and commodity derivative instruments and anticipated natural gas processing spreads and fuel recoveries 
quoted market prices are not available for all of the company s non trading positions  therefore  the value of non trading positions is a summation of the forecasted values calculated for each commodity based upon internally generated forecast prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows for in millions non trading commodity market risk  net the company may designate certain derivative instruments for the purchase or sale of physical commodities  purchase or sale of electric power and fuel procurement as normal purchases and normal sales contracts under the provisions of sfas no 
normal purchases and normal sales contracts are not recorded in price risk management assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and earnings recognition is recorded in the period in which physical delivery of the commodity occurs 
the company applies normal purchases and normal sales to commodity contracts for the sale of natural gas liquids produced by its subsidiary  enogex products corporation  to electric power contracts by og e and for fuel procurement by og e 
credit risk credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations 
if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform  we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements 
in that event  our financial results could be adversely affected and we could incur losses 
for og e  new business customers are required to provide a security deposit in the form of cash  a bond or irrevocable letter of credit which is refunded when the account is closed 
new residential customers  whose outside credit scores indicate risk  are required to provide a security deposit which is refunded after months of good payment history per the regulatory rules 
the payment behavior of all existing customers is monitored and if the payment behavior indicates sufficient risk per the regulatory rules  customers will be required to provide a security deposit 
enogex maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes minimize overall credit risk 
these policies include the evaluation of a potential counterparty s financial condition including credit rating  collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which provide for the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
enogex also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
currency risk the company is exposed to currency risk from the canadian dollar 
this exposure is created by infrequent energy transactions entered into by oeri 
currency risk associated with this exposure is not material
