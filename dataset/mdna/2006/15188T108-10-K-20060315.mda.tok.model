factors affecting comparability consolidated partnerships primarily due to our adoption of fin r as of march   we consolidate more than partnerships predominantly investment funds we sponsor in our financial statements 
the operating results for include a full period of operations for these entities  as well as the elimination of transactions between the entities and our subsidiaries 
in  the operating results include only nine months operating results as we adopted this accounting standard as of march of that year 
the results for do not include any operating results for these entities 
acquisitions we acquired cclp in march operating results in our portfolio investing segment prior to the acquisition date include interest income on a loan we made in july following the acquisition  operating results of cclp are included in our mortgage banking segment 
our operating results were impacted significantly by the november acquisition of chartermac capital  an affiliated business that  until the date of acquisition  had acted as an external manager for our company and our subsidiaries 
as a result of the acquisition  we generate more taxable income and have assumed numerous expenses that had previously been covered by fees paid to chartermac capital 
in addition  the issuance of new classes of subsidiary equity as part of the purchase price of both acquisitions requires us to apportion certain earnings and identify them as due to the holders of that equity 
accounting changes the adoption of several accounting pronouncements has affected our financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristic of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
caused us to reclassify certain liability and expense categories 
the adoption of fin r as noted above led to a significant increase in the amount of assets and liabilities we record due to consolidation of numerous investment partnerships see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
this consolidation also results in the recognition of the operating results of partnerships in which we have virtually no equity interest  the elimination of transactions between our businesses and those partnerships and the allocation of their results to their investor partners 
other items at the end of  management elected to discontinue the use of the related capital company trade name  effective january  the decision resulted in the non cash write off of an intangible asset recorded at the time we acquired related capital now known as chartermac capital 
the write off amounted to million and reduced net income by million  net of tax benefit  or per basic and diluted share 
results of operations overview the following is a summary of our operations change change of of of vs

in thousands revenues revenues revenues revenues    income before income taxes    net income    our consolidated results over the three year period illustrate the impact of our changing business from an externally managed business  primarily generating recurring  non taxable revenues  to one with a large proportion of fee based transactional income and costs associated with internal management 
this transition included o our acquisition of chartermac capital in late  adding the majority of our fund management revenues  and completely internalizing our management structure  o rapid growth of our taxable  fee based business through sponsorship of increasingly larger funds in and  and o approximately doubling our mortgage banking business through the acquisition of cclp in we expect that this transition will continue in with the launching of our expanded credit intermediation business  which will also generate taxable fee income 
at the same time  our reported revenues do not fully reflect the growth of the business due to the impact of consolidating sponsored investment partnerships  as described more fully below 
the underlying revenue growth stems from the introduction of new products such as effective variable rate bond financing  risk sharing mortgage loan originations for freddie mac and different forms of credit intermediation 
beyond the growth of our businesses  costs have also increased due to among other factors o increasing financing costs due to higher borrowing levels attendant to expansion and general increases in interest rates  o the internalization of management in  o the requirement for infrastructure to support growth  primarily in and  and o the costs associated with the creation of tax credit equity funds that vary with the level of fund sponsorship activity  although the majority of such costs are reimbursed and the reimbursements are recognized as revenue 
along with the compositional changes in the business  we are now also increasingly subject to taxation  although tax benefits may result based upon the annual taxable income or loss from these businesses 
the increase in the level of tax benefit recognized over the three year period presented reflect the increasing proportion of these taxable businesses and increased book losses of those businesses 
see income taxes below 
revenues our revenues for the three years ended december were as follows change change in thousands vs

mortgage revenue bond interest income    other interest income    fee income fund sponsorship    mortgage banking    credit intermediation    total fee income    other revenues prepayment penalties   construction service fees   administration fees   expense reimbursements   other    total other revenues    revenues of consolidated partnerships   n a total revenues    the substantial growth in our annual revenues in both and resulted primarily from the rapid growth of our fund management segment  particularly from the acquisition of chartermac capital in late chartermac capital has contributed the entire amount of fund sponsorship fees and much of the other revenues categories  all stemming from the sponsorship of tax credit equity funds  while our credit intermediation business has also grown over the three year period 
during the same period  aggressive expansion of the mortgage banking businesses has generated substantial revenue growth  particularly in with the acquisition of cclp 
beside the increase in mortgage banking fees  these businesses also contributed to the increase in other interest income as rising interest rates helped to generate revenues from escrow balances  and constitute the bulk of prepayment penalty revenue due to refinancing and payoff activity 
the portfolio investing business  while not growing as rapidly in  continues to generate higher revenues due to net increases in the portfolio and the long term nature of the revenue stream 
revenues of consolidated partnerships were introduced upon our adoption of fin r in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these revenues increase as we sponsor additional tax credit equity funds or assume the general partner interests in property level partnerships  but the consolidation also results in the elimination of revenues earned by our portfolio investing and fund management subsidiaries for transactions with the partnerships 
the revenues eliminated were as follows in thousands change mortgage revenue bond interest income  fund sponsorship fees   credit intermediation fees   other revenues   total   on a comparable basis  including chartermac capital revenues for all of  including cclp revenues for all three years and adjusting for the impact of consolidated partnerships  our total revenues increased approximately in and in the variances in mortgage revenue bond interest income and fee income are described below in results by segment 
other interest income includes income from temporary investments  interest earned on mortgage banking escrow balances and interest earned on our loans to capri see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in stems primarily from o the expansion of the mortgage banking business due to the acquisition of cclp and the increase in origination volume  and o higher cash balances coupled with increasing market interest rates for temporary investments 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in the level of interest from capri following the conversion of a portion of the loan to an ownership interest 
the increase in over relates mostly to the original capri loan in the middle of the increase in prepayment penalties is principally due to growth in mortgage banking refinancing volume over the period 
expense reimbursement income represents income for services chartermac capital provides to affiliates  which became a part of our operations with the acquisition of chartermac capital in november the growth in reflects the growth in the population of entities to which services are provided

significant borrowings during and included those related to o acquisitions and fundings of mortgage revenue bonds totaling approximately million in and million in  o short term investments to acquire equity interests inherent in the fund sponsorship portion of our fund management business since the chartermac capital acquisition in the fourth quarter of  o short term lending for mortgage loans prior to their sale to agencies and conduits  which increased markedly in as the business grew  and o a loan to capri in the third quarter of as the first step in our full acquisition of its mortgage banking business and obtaining an option with respect to a partial ownership of its fund advisory business 
in addition to higher borrowings  interest expense reflects an increase in the average borrowing rate to as compared to in and in the increase in the average borrowing rate resulted from gradual increases in the bond market association municipal swap index bma and libor rates during and  following sharp declines in prior years 
interest expense also includes amounts paid pursuant to swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million as compared to notional amounts of swaps in effect totaling million in and million in as part of our risk management strategy 
the amount reported as interest expense preferred shares of subsidiary represents dividends on equity issuer s preferred shares subject to mandatory repurchase  which we reported as an allocation of income outside of operating earnings until the adoption of new accounting rules in july see further discussion in other items below 
salaries and benefits in and include amortization of share grants issued as part of the chartermac capital acquisition transaction 
the amortization of these grants amounted to million in  million in and million in  and the decrease in was a result of staggered vesting terms  most of which ended throughout the underlying increase in salary costs is directly attributable to the internalization of management in the fourth quarter of and subsequent hiring as our businesses have expanded 
in addition  also includes approximately million of costs related to the departure of stuart boesky as our chief executive officer and an executive of one of our subsidiaries 
prior to the chartermac capital acquisition  all salary costs recognized were generated by the mortgage banking business 
general and administrative expenses in many categories increased in due to the expansion of our businesses and the acquisition of cclp  particularly with regard to increased occupancy needs and professional fees 
the increase in occupancy is in relation to the growth of our infrastructure to accommodate the expansion of our business lines 
the growth in professional fees was due  in part  to o accounting and compliance costs related to sarbanes oxley implementation  o legal costs related to protecting our interests in properties whose developer contractor experienced financial problems see note to the consolidated financial statements and other properties on which we foreclosed see note to the consolidated financial statements  and o legal costs associated with the start up of our credit intermediation subsidiary 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was predominantly due to our acquisition of chartermac capital and the associated recognition of expenses associated with management of the company and origination of tax credit equity funds 
these expenses include approximately million in organization and offering o o costs in and approximately million in depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the period as compared to  primarily due to the a higher level of mortgage servicing rights amortization following the cclp acquisition 
the increase in as compared to was almost entirely due to amortization of intangibles acquired in the chartermac capital transaction 
the trade name write off in pertains to management s decision at the end of to discontinue the use of the related capital company trade name when we renamed the subsidiary chartermac capital 
we had recorded an intangible asset in as part of the acquisition of the business  and the write off represents the unamortized balance of the asset at the time the name change was determined 
of the asset impairment charge in  approximately million relates to management s decision to discontinue construction of a property in connection with the financial difficulties of the property developer see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the balance of the amount and the entirety of the and charges pertained to the planned or actual restructuring of terms for mortgage revenue bond and mezzanine loan investments 
we did not record the expenses of the consolidated partnerships prior to april  the increase in the expenses generated by these entities is a result of the non comparable consolidation periods as well as the increase in the number of such partnerships consolidated 
virtually all of the expenses of the consolidated partnerships are absorbed by their equity partners

in and  this amount also includes losses from tax advantaged investment vehicles similar to those we sponsor 
the sharp increase in relates to the level of joint venture investment activity as several ventures approached completion  allowing us to realize our share of development income and gains on sale 
the increase also includes incremental dividends from converting a portion of our arcap investment from preferred to common units 
the variance in gain on sale of mortgage revenue bonds relates to the level of repayments in the portfolio investing segment 
similarly  the year to year variations in gains on sales of loans are attributable to the fluctuations in the volume of mortgage originations 
see results by segment below 
the total of income allocated to preferred shareholders of subsidiary  including the portion classified as interest expense see expenses above  increased over the three year period due to an additional preferred offering consummated in april the income allocation to scus and smus represents the proportionate share of after tax income attributable to holders of subsidiary equity as if they were all converted to common shares 
the comparatively smaller amount allocated to scus in is due to their issuance upon the acquisition of chartermac capital late in that year 
there was no income allocated to smus in or as the units were first issued in may income taxes a large majority of our pre tax income is derived from our portfolio investing businesses  which are structured as partnership entities  as such  the income from those investments does not subject us to income taxes 
the fund management and mortgage banking businesses are conducted in corporations and are subject to income taxes 
because the distributions paid on the minority interests in these corporate subsidiaries effectively provide a tax deduction  as well as other factors within these businesses  they often have losses for book purposes 
in  the other factors include the million write off of an intangible asset see expenses above and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for income taxes for these corporate subsidiaries in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax benefit disclosed relates to the book losses of the taxable businesses and the tax deductible distributions on their subsidiary equity 
as the proportion of our pre tax income contributed by the businesses generating taxable income and losses changes  the resulting tax benefit or provision may appear incongruous with our consolidated income before income taxes  as illustrated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was in  in and in  due to the factors noted above

we continued to expand our revenue bond portfolio in and  although the rate of investment slowed beginning in due to challenging market conditions whereby some potential investments did not meet our underwriting standards 
while we saw deferments by texas developers that shifted a substantial level of acquisitions until just after the end of the year thereby benefiting our volume  in we expanded our presence in california  the nation s largest bond market  and originated investments in new markets in arizona  massachusetts  kentucky and new york 
competitive factors also drove the decline in origination rates in both and while the decline in interest rates for new investments has gradually lowered the average yield of our portfolio  from an income perspective  the low interest rate environment has been favorable for us 
although the bma rate  the short term tax exempt index  increased markedly in  our weighted average cost of debt associated with these investments  taking our hedging into effect  continues to allow us to recognize healthy spreads between our cost of borrowing and the interest rates earned 
other income in this segment is predominantly interest income on investments other than mortgage revenue bonds and intercompany interest and royalty fees eliminated in consolidation 
the increases in and over prior years are due largely to capri loan interest see note to the consolidated financial statements and intercompany financing utilizing this segment s cash flows

our fund management activities generate origination and acquisition fees associated with sponsoring tax credit equity investment funds and for assisting the funds in acquiring assets  which we recognize when the equity is invested by the investment fund 
we also receive asset management fees for the services we perform for the funds once they are operating  which we recognize over the service periods 
the increase in fund sponsorship fees represents a full year of owning chartermac capital  as includes only the period following the november acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  comparing the period to the full period  as if we had owned chartermac capital as of january  the pro forma period  originations increased  equity invested increased and fund sponsorship revenues increased approximately 
fees based on equity raised we earn o o service and partnership management fees based upon the level of equity we raise for tax credit equity funds 
o o service fees are realized immediately while we earn the partnership management fees over five year periods 
fees earned for o o services increased approximately to million compared to million in the period primarily due to the increase in the fee rate realized  offset by a marginal decrease in equity raised 
partnership management fees revenues increased approximately in to million compared to million for the same period in this increase is primarily the result of ongoing revenues for fund sponsorships completed in and in  the aggregate of these fees increased approximately over the pro forma period 
this increase exceeded the rise in equity raised due to higher average fee rates realized as a result of the change in the mix of funds originated in as compared to fees based on equity invested we earn property acquisition fees and acquisition allowance fees based upon the level of fund equity invested 
these fees increased to approximately million in  representing an approximate increase compared to the results 
the increase in fees is lower than the increase of equity invested because of a decrease in the fee rate realized  stemming from changes in the mix of funds originated 
fees we earned in these categories during increased to approximately million  representing an approximate increase compared to the pro forma period results 
this increase exceeded the increase in investments due to a higher rate of fees realized as a result of the fund composition 
fees for management advisory services the increase in partnership and asset management fees is attributable to o the higher level of assets under management as we add to the population of funds sponsored with nine added in and eleven in o a million incentive management fee earned in for services provided to amac  and o the improvement of the cash position of certain investment funds allowing us to collect management fees in which we did not previously recognize until collectibility was reasonably assured 
fees earned in these categories in represented an increase of approximately over the pro forma period  attributable to the growth of assets under management due to new fund originations during that period 
credit intermediation and other credit intermediation fees decreased in as compared to despite additional credit intermediated funds closed over the course of both years 
the decrease was due to the timing of the related agreements  the fees for which are risk weighted toward the construction periods 
as we recognize the fees over periods of two to years  the sponsorship of new funds fluctuates with the inception and expiration of the associated intermediation periods 
the increase in these fees in as compared to was caused by the timing of the chartermac capital acquisition 
the increase in other revenues reflects the impact of the chartermac capital acquisition  whereby we recorded revenues for miscellaneous services that chartermac capital provides to funds it manages 
on a comparable basis  these revenues increased approximately in over the pro forma period 
we anticipate that the market for tax credit equity investing will continue to be strong in the near term but that heightened competition in the marketplace will lead to margin compression 
we expect  however  that the launching of our in house credit intermediation business will offset the impact of that margin compression from a net income perspective as we are likely to retain amounts previously paid or shared for credit intermediation and for providing specified rates of return to fund investors 
in addition  we anticipate that planned growth of amac will lead to increased partnership and asset management fees beginning in mortgage banking the table below shows selected information regarding our mortgage banking activities for the three years ended december change change vs

the increase in originations over the and levels was driven largely by the acquisition of cclp 
including cclp in all periods  the increase would have been approximately over  and the increase would have been approximately as compared to the activity gains in stemmed from a significant increase in fannie mae originations  as cclp has traditionally conducted a large portion of its business through fannie mae  and pricing changes that allowed us to garner greater market share 
conduit originations also increased sharply as we continue to pursue business not involving agency execution in response to market demand 
these increases were partially offset by a sharp decline in freddie mac business  as the period reflects a large single borrower pool transaction  with no comparable transaction in the current year period 
the current year also includes a significantly higher level of assumption lending for which we receive assumption fees rather than origination fees 
originations in reflected a determined focus on expanding the freddie mac platform  including approximately million of affordable housing transactions and significant levels of portfolio originations 
in addition  we diversified our funding with a higher proportion of conduit lending and other funding avenues outside the traditional fannie mae and freddie mac funding sources 
also  the expansion of product offerings  including early rate lock products  and the growth of our origination team aided the growth of this business 
the increase in origination fees was lower than the increase in originations because certain of the portfolio originations in were opportunistically priced at lower than standard fee rates 
originations for the three years ended december are broken down as follows of of of total total total fannie mae    freddie mac    fha   conduit and other    subtotal    assumptions    total    the increase in the servicing portfolio and servicing fees in is a result of the cclp acquisition 
adjusting for the impact of the acquisition  servicing fee income in declined approximately as compared to the same period in the decline was caused by a higher level of payoffs and amortization as compared to service retained originations that led to a decrease in the comparable basis servicing portfolio 
despite the high volume of originations in  our servicing portfolio declined slightly during the year due to an unusually high volume of loans paid off during the year and a high percentage of originations for loans without associated servicing 
more than of the originations were additive to the portfolio 
despite the decline in the year end servicing portfolio level  the servicing fees increase in was due to a higher average portfolio during when compared to the higher average resulted from a large sub servicing agreement which began in april  while the loans were included for all of additionally  more than half of the loan payoffs during occurred in the second half of the year 
interest income relates primarily to that earned on escrow balances 
the increase in was due to higher origination volume and increased market rates earned 
the increase in prepayment penalties relates to a higher level of refinancing and payoff activity in the current year 
both categories also increased due to the cclp acquisition 
the significant increase in prepayment penalties relates to the sharp increase in refinancing activity in both and gain on sale of mortgages pertains primarily to sales of mortgages for which we retain servicing rights 
an increase in as compared to due to the increased origination volume was offset by a higher reserve for loan losses  due to the increased volume and the underlying debt service statistics in the portfolio 
we anticipate that the continued growth of the securitized loan market will result in an increase in the proportion of our conduit executions to the total in coming years 
we expect that our affiliations with pension fund advisors and amac will aid this growth 
in addition  the increased customer base that comes with chartermac s overall expansion through acquisitions and organic growth should increase our origination volume as we further develop our integrated infrastructure 
the availability of the significant level of debt capital in the market and general compression of fees industry wide  however  are likely to put pressure on our fee revenue and margins for the foreseeable future and may offset some of the profits expected from volume gains 
consolidated partnerships the results of consolidated partnerships reflected in our financial statements are for entities we effectively control according to the definitions of fin r  and other partnerships we control  but in which we have no equity interest or  in the case of partnerships  an insignificant equity interest 
our fund management segment earns fees from many of the entities  however  and our portfolio investing business earns interest on mortgage revenue bonds for which these partnerships are the obligors 
the consolidated partnerships are primarily tax credit equity investment funds we sponsor and manage  while the others are property level partnerships for which we have assumed the role of general partner 
the results we reported in reflect twelve months of operations for the partnerships we consolidate while includes only nine months of results as we consolidated these entities as of march  the increased amounts in are also due to the origination of eight funds and the assumption of the general partner interests in property level partnerships in the past year  all of which are included in the population 
as third party investors hold virtually all of the equity partnership interests in these entities  we allocate all results of operations to those partners except for approximately  representing our nominal ownership 
as a result  the consolidation of these partnerships has an insignificant impact on our net income 
impact of hurricanes during during the second half of  three hurricanes struck the southern united states 
while all of our businesses are involved in properties in the areas affected by the storms  few of those properties suffered damage severe enough to affect our results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on our results for the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our short term business needs including investments primarily with cash provided by operations  securitization of investments and revolving or warehouse credit facilities 
our primary sources of capital to meet long term liquidity needs including acquisitions are debt and various types of equity offerings  including equity of our subsidiaries 
we believe that our financing capacity and cash flow from current operations are adequate to meet our immediate and long term liquidity requirements 
nonetheless  as business needs warrant  we may issue other types of debt or equity in the future 
debt and securitizations short term liquidity provided by operations comes primarily from interest income from mortgage revenue bonds and promissory notes in excess of the related financing costs  mortgage origination and servicing fees  and fund sponsorship and credit intermediation fees 
we typically generate funds for investment purposes from corresponding financing activities 
we have the following debt and securitization facilities to provide short term and long term liquidity o million  used for mortgage banking needs  which was reduced to million in february  matures in may  and is renewable annually  o million  used to acquire equity interests in property ownership entities prior to the inclusion of these equity interests into investments funds  which matures in october  o million  used to provide the interim loan to capri  the maturity of which has been extended pending its replacement with a new facility from the same lender  o million  established in connection with the cmc acquisition  which expires in december  o million in mbia credit intermediation through  under which we can complete up to million of floating rate securitizations and million of auction rate securitizations  o securitization through the merrill lynch p floats rites program of a specified percentage of the fair value of mortgage revenue bonds not otherwise securitized or pledged as collateral  and o securitization through the goldman sachs tic toc program of a specified percentage of the fair value of mortgage revenue bonds not otherwise securitized or credit intermediated  which matures in october as of december   we had approximately million available to borrow under these debt and securitization facilities without exceeding limits imposed by debt covenants and our bylaws 
we continue to actively manage our balance sheet and our relationships to mitigate the impact of the factors listed above and to continue to diversify our sources of capital 
although certain of the facilities noted above mature in  we expect to renew  replace or refinance them as necessary  and we are in negotiations to replace the maturing lines listed above  all of which are owed to the same lender  with a master credit facility from that same lender 
while we believe that we will be able to do so  there is no assurance that we will achieve terms favorable to us 
also  while we intend to optimize our securitization borrowing  our continued ability to do so is dependent on o the availability of bonds to be used in securitizations or as excess collateral  o the depth of the market of buyers for tax exempt floating rate investments  and o our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with credit intermediators and liquidity providers 
our debt financing facilities are more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
equity other than our common shares  we have several classes of equity outstanding  with varying claims upon our income and cash flows o convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares convertible cra shares  o perpetual convertible community reinvestment act preferred shares convertible cra shares  o preferred shares of equity issuer some of which are subject to mandatory repurchase  o special common units scus of our subsidiary  chartermac capital company llc ccc  and o special membership units smus of our subsidiary cm investor  llc 
the convertible cra shares are economically equivalent to our common shares  receiving the same dividend 
unlike the common shares  however  these shares are not publicly traded and do not have voting rights but entitle the holders to credit under the us government s community reinvestment act 
these shares are convertible into common shares at the holders option  mostly on a one for one basis 
we first issued convertible cra shares during and the program has since become increasingly popular with a broad range of banks that invest in our shares to both make an investment in us and to make qualifying community reinvestment act investments 
the convertible cra shares are similar to the convertible cra shares in that they entitle the holder to cra credit and are convertible into common shares without having voting rights prior to conversion 
unlike the convertible cra shares  however  these shares carry a fixed dividend and each will be convertible into common shares at a rate of approximately beginning in july the preferred shares of equity issuer entitle their holders to a claim on the income and cash flows of most of our portfolio investing business 
they have no voting rights with respect to chartermac and are not convertible into chartermac common shares 
the scus entitle their holders to a claim on the income and cash flows of our subsidiaries through which we operate our fund sponsorship business 
the scus have no direct voting rights with respect to chartermac  but all of the holders also have special preferred voting shares of chartermac  which have voting rights equivalent to our common shares 
the scus are convertible into common shares and are entitled to tax adjusted dividends based on the common dividend rate 
smu holders are entitled to distributions at the same time as  and only if  we pay distributions on our common shares 
smu distributions were initially per year  subject to adjustment in the amount of of the percentage increases or decreases in the dividends paid by us on the common shares 
in october  we filed a shelf registration with the sec providing for the issuance of up to million in common shares  preferred shares and debt securities 
the shelf registration was declared effective on march  and will be available for use on april  we have no current plans to draw upon this shelf registration but may as opportunities present themselves or business requirements dictate 
we have also filed a registration statement on form s providing for the issuance of up to million of common shares 
we have not yet determined whether we will draw upon this registration statement 
further information about our equity instruments is included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
summary of cash flows vs 
the higher net increase in cash and cash equivalents in as compared to resulted principally from increased financing cash flows that offset a decline in cash provided by operating activities 
operating cash flows decreased by million in as compared to the level  due primarily to the high level of mortgage originations at the end of while the assets will be sold in the first quarter of  the increase in the level of mortgage assets held at the end of the year served to offset the increase in net income exclusive of non cash expenses and charges 
investing outflows in were approximately the same as in despite increased mortgage revenue bond originations net of repayments and restricted cash requirements as we expanded the mortgage banking segment 
investing activities in included a higher level of investing outside of our normal business lines  most notably the loan to capri  while included a million co investment with amac in a first mortgage loan  and other investments that aggregated less than million 
financing inflows in were million higher than in this was primarily a result of optimizing our securitization capabilities and taking advantage of these facilities to monetize our revenue bond investment portfolio  the expansion of our mortgage banking borrowing capacity and the issuance of our convertible cra shares 
these factors collectively exceeded the higher level of equity issuances including subsidiary equity in vs 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during was lower than the increase in despite higher operating cash flows due to decreased financing activity 
operating cash flows were higher in the period by a margin of million 
this increase resulted from a higher level of earnings exclusive of non cash expenses  which increased substantially following our acquisition of chartermac capital late in additionally  the timing of receipts and payments in operating asset and liability accounts contributed to this increase  the most significant being the deferred revenues associated with the fund management business and higher interest and fees receivable associated with the expansion of our businesses 
investing outflows were approximately the same in as compared to a lower level of revenue bond acquisition and funding activity  and significantly lower acquisition outflows  were partially offset by our loan to capri 
in addition  in we received a much higher level of revenue bond repayments as compared to the level of repayments in stemmed from the expiration of lockout periods for older mortgage revenue bonds  with no comparable occurrence in financing inflows in the period were lower than in by million 
the primary reason for the higher inflows in was the level of securitization borrowings to finance the investment level in that year 
a higher amount of proceeds from equity offerings in were partially offset by the resulting increase in distributions to shareholders

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions sometimes involve future events that cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  our determination of estimates requires that we exercise our judgment 
while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different results may actually occur and any such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements o valuation of investments in mortgage revenue bonds  o valuation of mortgage servicing rights  o impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and o accounting for income taxes 
valuation of investments in mortgage revenue bonds sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  provides guidance on determining the valuation of investments owned 
the initial classification of our investments in the available for sale category rather than as held to maturity is due to a provision in most of the mortgage revenue bonds under which we have a right to require redemption prior to maturity  although we can and may elect to hold them up to their maturity dates unless otherwise modified 
because of this classification  we must carry our investments at fair value 
since there is no ready market for these investments  we must exercise judgment in determining what constitutes fair value 
we estimate the fair value by calculating the present value of future payments under the bonds 
for bonds secured by non stabilized properties  the discount rate is based upon the average rate of new originations for the quarter leading up to the valuation date 
for bonds secured by stabilized properties  the discount rate is reflective of the lower inherent risk 
if the property underlying the bond has substandard performance  a factor is added to the discount rate to allow for the additional risk 
conversely  if the underlying property is performing much better than expected  the discount rate may be reduced to allow for the reduced risk 
in making these determinations  we evaluate  among other factors bonds secured by properties in construction phase o assets where there are issues outstanding regarding timely completion of the construction  even if there is no apparent risk of financial loss 
bonds secured by properties that are in lease up or stabilized phases o stabilization requirements ie  minimum occupancy level and debt service coverage for specified periods not yet met but all completion requirements ie  timely submission of documentation regarding certificates of occupancy  deal waivers  etc  as well as completing construction within the budgeted cost met 
established material variation from anticipated operating performance  ability to meet stabilization test within the allotted time period is in question or material deficiencies at the collateral level  or other weaknesses exist calling into question the viability of the project in the near to intermediate term  or o project viability is in question and defaults exist and notification of such has been delivered 
enhanced possibility of loss may exist or has been specified 
we use these criteria to assess all of our mortgage revenue bonds 
in our valuation review  any bonds meeting these criteria are monitored and assessed for risk of financial loss 
if no financial loss is expected  the fair value of a bond is considered to be the lower of outstanding face amount or the present value of future cash flows  with the discount rate adjusted to provide for the applicable risk factors 
if a financial loss is expected  the bond is considered impaired and written down to fair value as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  requires that servicing rights retained when mortgage loans are sold be recorded as assets at fair value and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
significant judgment is required in accounting for these assets  including o determining the fair value of the asset retained when the associated mortgage is sold and in subsequent reporting periods  including such factors as costs to service the loans  the estimated rate of prepayments  the estimated rate of default and an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of cash flows  and o estimating the appropriate proportion and period for amortizing the asset 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value 
we assess our mortgage servicing rights for impairment based on the fair value of the assets as compared to carrying values 
we estimate the fair value by obtaining market information from one of the primary mortgage servicing rights brokers 
to determine impairment  the mortgage servicing portfolio is stratified by the issuer of the underlying mortgage loans and we compare the estimated fair value of each stratum to its carrying value 
when the carrying value of capitalized servicing assets exceeds fair value  we recognize temporary impairment through a valuation allowance  fair value in excess of the amount capitalized is not recognized 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our mortgage servicing rights for other than temporary impairment to determine whether the carrying value before the application of the valuation allowance is recoverable 
when we determine that a portion of the balance is not recoverable  the asset and the valuation allowance are reduced to reflect permanent impairment 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment regarding the fair value of each reporting unit which is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this  in turn  requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business and the life over which cash flows will occur 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment 
in addition  should we determine that goodwill is impaired  we would also review intangible assets for the same business to determine if they were impaired also 
as with goodwill  any indicators of impairment of a specific intangible asset would also lead to a review 
as the methods for determining fair values of intangible assets are similar to those for determining the fair value of goodwill  the same judgments and uncertainties apply to these determinations as well 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns as well as the recoverability of amounts we record  including deferred tax assets 
furthermore  these projected future tax consequences include our assumption as to the continuing tax free nature of a significant portion of our earnings 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in certain financial instruments  primarily mortgage revenue bonds and other bond related investments that are subject to various forms of market risk  including interest rate risk 
we seek to prudently and actively manage such risks to earn sufficient compensation to justify the undertaking of such risks and to maintain capital levels which are commensurate with the risks we undertake 
the assumptions related to the following discussion of market risk involve judgments involving future economic market conditions  future corporate decisions and other interrelating factors  many of which are beyond our control and all of which are difficult or impossible to predict with precise accuracy 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward looking information are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information included herein will prove to be accurate 
due to the significant uncertainties inherent in forward looking information  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as our representation that our objectives and plans would be achieved 
interest rate risk the nature of our investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose us to income and expense volatility due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
a rising interest rate environment could reduce the demand for multifamily tax exempt and taxable financing  which could limit our ability to invest in mortgage revenue bonds or to structure transactions 
conversely  falling interest rates may prompt historical renters to become homebuyers  in turn potentially reducing the demand for multifamily housing 
our exposure to interest rate is twofold o the potential increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt  and o the impact of interest rates on the fair value of our assets 
impact on earnings our investments in mortgage revenue bonds generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying properties  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under our variable rate securitization programs fluctuate with market interest rates based on the bma index and are re set weekly or every days 
in addition  we have variable rate debt related to our acquisition financing and our warehouse facilities  with rates based on libor 
other long term sources of capital  such as our preferred shares of equity issuer and our convertible cra preferred shares  carry a fixed dividend rate and as such  are not impacted by changes in market interest rates 
with the exception of million of debt hedged via interest rate swap agreements  the full amount of our liabilities labeled on our consolidated balance sheet as financing arrangements and notes payable are variable rate debts 
we estimate that an increase of in interest rates would decrease our annual net income by approximately million 
conversely  we have large escrow balances maintained by our mortgage banking business and we are entitled to the interest earned on those balances 
a increase in interest rates would therefore increase our net income by approximately million 
we manage this risk through the use of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and forward bond origination commitments  as described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we manage our exposure by striving for diversification in our businesses to include those less susceptible to interest rate changes and by managing our leverage 
impact on valuation of assets changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of our portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds 
we estimate the fair value for each revenue bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of our mortgage revenue bonds will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in their estimated fair values 
for example  we estimate that  using the same methodology used to estimate the portfolio fair value under sfas no 
 a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds by approximately million and a decrease would result in an increase of approximately million 
changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds do not impact our reported net income  net income per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other accumulated comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity  and may affect our borrowing capability to the extent that collateral requirements are sometimes based on our asset values 
management s report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting the management of chartermac the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of trustees regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
chartermac management assessed the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based upon our assessment we believe that  as of december   our internal control over financial reporting is effective in accordance with those criteria

the company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by  or under the supervision of  the company s principal executive and principal financial officers  or persons performing similar functions  and effected by the company s board of trustees  management  and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls  material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
also  projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  management s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   is fairly stated  in all material respects  based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
also in our opinion  the company maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
we have also audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december  of the company and our report dated march  expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules
