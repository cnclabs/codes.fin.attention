item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we grew rapidly after our initial public offering through the making of selective acquisitions in which we retained key management 
this was consistent with our decentralized management approach adopted by our 
table of contents former senior management  which stands in stark contrast with the hands on company wide management approach of our new chief executive officer 
our new chief executive officer has devoted substantial effort to changing the business strategy and environment in miami and in ft 
myers in light of recent events and to effectively managing their operations 
we have reorganized our early stage clinical development business by appointing the president of anapharm to also manage all of our bioanalytical laboratories  appointing anapharm s chief operating officer to manage all of our clinical trial facilities  and hiring a new senior executive to initially supervise our miami and ft 
myers clinical trial facilities 
currently we are seeking to retain one or two senior persons with substantial early clinical development operations experience to head up our miami and ft 
myers facilities 
we are continuing to work with fda counsel and other professionals in order to evaluate both of these facilities and are actively communicating to our clients our commitment to integrity and quality professional services 
additionally  we have established an internal audit department  which reports to our audit committee 
we have hired an internal audit manager and are currently seeking to add two additional persons 
montreal tuberculosis issue at the end of november  we learned that a subject had entered a study at our montreal  canada facility and not disclosed to us that he had traveled to a third world country where the risk of being infected with tuberculosis was high 
as part of our screening process  the protocol prepared by the sponsor did not require us to test subjects for tuberculosis  and we did not otherwise do so 
the above subject showed coughing at the end of the confinement period  he was investigated and found later to have active tuberculosis 
we have been cooperating with montreal public health authorities  health canada and the institutional review board for this study with regard to this issue 
as a result of this incident in canada  we now require tuberculosis testing on all subjects whenever a known or potentially immunosuppressant drug is a subject of our clinical research 
clients and marketing our clients include most of the largest branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device companies in the world 
we believe we have developed a strong reputation for client service and have cultivated relationships with key decision makers within our clients organizations 
we focus on meeting our clients expectations  and we believe that this has been a leading factor in generating repeat business from our clients 
our branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device company clients often represent multiple sources of business for us since there are often a number of therapeutic specialty or other groups that contract separately for services within one client company 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct revenue  which does not include reimbursed out of pockets from clients  was attributed to our operations based in the united states  approximately from operations in canada  approximately from operations in europe  and approximately from operations in the rest of the world 
the mix of our clients and revenue generated from individual clients varies from period to period 
in  and  no client  on a pro forma basis  accounted for or more of our direct revenue 
for the years ended december  and  no client represented more than and of our pro forma direct revenue  respectively  not including reimbursed out of pockets 
for  we assume we owned pharmanet as of january  at december   one client represented approximately of our accounts receivable or of our accounts receivable net of client advances 
we employ an experienced team of sales and marketing professionals who market our services to branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device companies  primarily to north american  
table of contents european and japanese companies 
additionally  some members of our senior management play a very active role in managing our relationships with existing clients and in helping to generate business from new clients 
our competitors the drug development services industry is highly fragmented and is comprised of a number of large  full service drug development services companies as well as many small companies and limited service providers 
we believe we are now one of the largest drug development services companies ranked by contract research revenues for our major competitors in this industry include drug development services companies  including quintiles transnational corp  covance  inc  pharmaceutical product development  inc  mds pharma services  a division of mds inc  pra international  parexel international corporation and icon  plc  and the research departments of universities and teaching hospitals 
in all phases of our business  we believe competitors will attempt to benefit from events described in this report 
see item a 
risk factors 
generally  drug development services companies principally compete on the basis of following factors the ability to recruit doctors and special population participants for clinical trials  medical and scientific expertise in specific therapeutic areas  the ability to organize and manage large scale trials  the quality of their services  the range of services they provide  financial stability  and the cost of services they provide 
the general trend toward consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry has resulted in increased competition for clients 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries as well as the trend by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to limit outsourcing to fewer rather than more drug development services companies has also heightened competition for contracts in our industry 
we compete in the early and late stage portions of the business on the basis of our reputation for high quality  our attention to client service and our broad range of therapeutic expertise 
our late stage business also has preferred provider relationships with a number of leading pharmaceutical companies and in the ordinary course of business seeks to enter into new relationships 
while these relationships do not guarantee us that we will be selected to manage a particular trial  we believe that they are a competitive advantage 
we compete in the early stage portion of the business on the basis of our ability to recruit special populations 
we believe our reputation for quality  our global presence and integrated worldwide data management systems make us competitive in the late stage portion of the business 
our bioanalytical laboratories compete primarily through the development of  or capacity to develop  validated methodologies  also known as assays 
we believe the capacity to develop these methodologies and in some cases their pre demand availability represent the best tools to sell these services to pharmaceutical companies  especially generic drug companies conducting bioequivalence studies 
in order to better attract generic business  these methodologies are often developed in a proactive way even before our generic clients need it 
our major competitors in this area include mds pharma services and pharmaceutical product development  inc indemnification and insurance in conjunction with our product development services  we employ or contract with physicians to serve as investigators in conducting clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers 
such testing creates the risk of liability for personal injury to or death of volunteers  particularly to volunteers with life threatening illnesses  resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered 
it is possible that we could be held liable for claims and expenses arising from any professional malpractice of the investigators with whom we contract 
table of contents or employ  or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials 
in addition  as a result of our operation of clinical trial facilities  we could be liable for the general risks associated with clinical trials including  but not limited to  adverse events resulting from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of medical care providers 
we also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform through each of our service groups 
for example  we could be held liable for errors or omissions or breach of contract if one of our laboratories inaccurately reports or fails to report laboratory results 
further  pharmanet has in the past acted  and intends in the future to act  as a sponsor on behalf of certain public company clients in connection with certain clinical trials in australia 
under australian law  the sponsor of a clinical trial must maintain an office in australia and pharmanet meets this requirement 
pharmanet s agreement to act in this capacity exposes it to additional liability as a sponsor in the event of any adverse incidents however  we have sought to reduce our risks by one or more of the following indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit or exclude liability contained in our contracts with clients and investigators  insurance maintained by clients and investigators and by us  and complying with various regulatory requirements  including the use of institutional review boards and the procurement of each participant s informed consent to participate in the study 
the contractual indemnifications we have generally do not fully protect us against certain of our own actions  such as negligence 
contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with clients  and the terms and scope of any indemnification  limitation of liability or exclusion of liability may vary from client to client and from trial to trial 
additionally  financial performance of these indemnities is not secured 
therefore  we bear the risk that any indemnifying party against which we have claims may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us 
additionally  while we maintain professional liability insurance that covers the locations in which we currently do business and that covers drug safety issues as well as data processing and other errors and omissions  it is possible that we could become subject to claims not covered by insurance or that exceed our coverage limits 
we could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside the scope of or in excess of a contractual indemnification provision  beyond the level of insurance coverage or not covered by insurance  or in the event that an indemnifying party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations 
with regard to the pending class and derivative actions  we have directors and officers liability coverage which may provide coverage  subject to a  deductible and normal coverage exclusions including any court finding of fraud 
government regulation all phases of a clinical trial are governed by the fda and state regulations  as well as other regulatory agencies including the therapeutic products directorate  or tpd  in canada and the european medicine evaluation agency 
we also follow the international conference of harmonization  or ich  guidelines which affect global drug development 
our clients are responsible for selecting qualified drug development services companies  providing those companies with study protocols  monitoring the clinical trials  reporting any changes or modification of the clinical trials to the fda or other regulatory agency  and reporting any serious and unexpected adverse reactions to the drug to the appropriate regulatory agency 
in the course of providing our drug development services  we must comply with a variety of related regulatory requirements 
our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trials process and  in most cases  good manufacturing practices  or gmp  regulations 
the industry standard for conducting clinical research and development studies is contained in regulations established for good clinical practice  or gcp 
the fda requires that the results submitted to it be based on studies conducted according to its good laboratory practices  or glp  standards for preclinical studies and laboratories and gcp standards for clinical facilities 
the standards address a number of issues  including selecting qualified investigators and sites  
table of contents obtaining specific written commitments from investigators  verifying that informed consents are obtained from participants  monitoring the validity and accuracy of data  verifying that we account for the drugs provided to us by our clients  and instructing investigators to maintain records and reports 
similar guidelines exist in various states and in other countries 
we may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with these rules 
failure to comply with these regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials 
additionally  because we frequently deal with biohazardous specimens and medical waste material  we are subject to licensing and regulation in the united states under federal  state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right to know regulations and the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste and materials 
our laboratory facilities are subject to applicable laws and regulations relating to the storage and disposal of laboratory specimens 
transportation and public health regulations apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens 
our laboratories also are subject to international air transport association regulations  which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens 
furthermore  when the materials are sent to another country  the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws  rules and regulations of such other country 
laboratories outside the united states are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing  the handling and disposal of medical specimens  hazardous waste and radioactive materials  as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees 
we contract with independent licensed companies to handle our waste disposal 
our laboratories in the us are also subject to the federal clinical laboratory improvement amendments  or clia which is administered by the centers for disease control and the fda  as well as similar state requirements 
clia requires certification of laboratories involved with patient samples and includes requirements concerning laboratory facilities  personnel and quality systems 
in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace  the united states occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus 
these regulations  among other things  require work practice controls  protective clothing and equipment  training  medical follow up  vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals  and transmission of blood borne and airborne pathogens 
furthermore  certain employees receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines 
we are subject to similar regulation in canada and spain 
the united states department of health and human services has promulgated rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  that govern the use  handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information 
these regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual s rights and the methods permissible for de identification of health information 
we are also subject to privacy legislation in canada under the federal personal information and electronic documents act  an act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector and the personal health information protection act ontario 
the use of controlled substances in our trials and our accounting for drug samples that contain controlled substances are subject to strict regulation in the united states under federal and state laws 
we are required to have a license from the united states drug enforcement administration 
we also are required to comply with similar laws in quebec and canada 
we also use special care and security procedures to safeguard and account for all controlled substances 
clinical trials conducted outside of the united states are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted 
these laws and regulations may or may not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the fda  and other laws and regulations regarding issues such as the protection of patient safety and privacy  and the control of study pharmaceuticals  medical devices  or other study materials 

table of contents studies conducted outside the united states may also be subject to regulation by the fda  if the studies are conducted pursuant to an ind application or an investigational device exemption 
it is the responsibility of the study sponsor and or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled 
in addition to this detailed regulatory structure  we must comply with all government regulations including local government regulations such as those described in issues relating to our miami facility in item of this report 
failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business  disqualification of data collected during clinical trials  liability for clean up costs  liability or the loss of revenue due to a failure to comply with our contractual obligations  the assessment of civil fines  or  in extreme cases  criminal penalties  as well as other enforcement actions 
backlog prior to our acquisition of pharmanet  we derived most of our revenue from short term clinical trials and related laboratory services 
for this reason  we had not historically measured backlog  except at december of each year 
because most of our early stage clinical trials and related services are completed within days from the time our clients award us the contract  we did not consider backlog to be a reliable indicator of our future business 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  late stage clinical trial services constituted a much larger percentage of our revenue 
this work is typically of longer duration than early stage clinical trial services 
consequently  backlog plays a more significant role in our business 
as of december  and  our backlog was approximately million and approximately million respectively 
the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to an increase in late stage backlog of approximately million  offset by a decrease of in early stage backlog 
the backlog in miami decreased approximately million from december  to the same period  offset by increase of approximately in all other early stage businesses combined 
we are initiating a policy of disclosing our total backlog  late stage backlog and early stage backlog 
backlog december  december  total million million late stage million million early stage million million backlog consists of anticipated direct revenue from letters of intent and contracts that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future or are in process and have not been completed 
we do not include verbal awards 
as of february   our backlog was approximately million 
we believe that the reduction of approximately in backlog as of february  which occurred primarily in our late stage business at pharmanet is not indicative of a trend  however  there can be no assurances 
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to realize all or most of the direct revenue included in backlog or estimate the portion expected to be completed in the current year 
although backlog can provide meaningful information to our management with respect to our business  it is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results 
backlog can be affected by a number of factors  including the size and duration of contracts  many of which are performed over several years  and the changes in labor utilization that typically occur during a study 
additionally  contracts relating to our clinical development business may be subject to early termination by the client  and clinical trials can be delayed or canceled for many reasons  including unexpected test results  safety concerns or regulatory developments 
also  the scope of a contract can change significantly during the course of a study 
if the scope of a contract is revised  the adjustment to backlog occurs when the revised scope is approved by the client 
for these and other reasons  we might not fully realize our entire backlog as direct revenue 

table of contents seasonality historically  our revenue has been higher in the second half of the year  primarily because of our miami facility 
with the growth of our business we did not experience seasonality in or in fact  after two record quarters in the first half of  our miami revenue materially decreased in the third and fourth quarters 
pharmanet has historically experienced seasonality with higher revenue in the first and second quarters 
employees at march   we had approximately  full time and part time employees world wide 
this follows significant layoffs in miami 
approximately of sfbc anapharm s employees were members of a union  however  the union was recently decertified with the consent of the union

item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this form k before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in such case  the market price of our common stock would likely decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks associated with recent actions  inquiries and lawsuits if we are unable to convince our clients that the problems principally related to our miami facility were either not accurately reported or have been rectified  we may lose future revenue and our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
although the report of the independent counsel which our board of directors retained to review the allegations contained in the bloomberg reports largely concluded that the reports allegations were unfounded  the repetition of these allegations in the media has harmed our reputation and cost us business in our miami facility 
these problems have been compounded by the structural and other local regulatory issues affecting the real estate and related improvements of the miami facility 
clients may decline to give us contracts for studies to be performed by our miami facility unless we can convince them that the operational allegations and structural and other allegations affecting the physical property are not impacting our ability to provide first rate clinical research in compliance with our client s protocols and all regulatory requirements 
depending upon the amount of revenue lost  the results may have a material and adverse affect on our future results of operations  including a reduction not only in our net earnings but a deviation from our forecasted net earnings 
moreover  while the loss of business seems to have been largely confined to our miami operation  we cannot predict if clients may withhold business elsewhere 

table of contents if we are unable to deal with all of the issues affecting the property upon which our miami facility operates  we may lose future revenue and our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we are presently facing a number of serious issues with regard to our property located in miami including our principal miami facility is required to obtain a building permit by late april and to make structural repairs within days thereafter that are necessary to operate the facility in compliance with applicable regulations 
we very recently learned that the county building department believes the miami facility should be classified as a generic i or institutional classification 
this will increase our remediation costs unless we appeal the ruling and are successful 
additionally  we need to comply with all fire department requirements in connection with our remediation plan 
we are uncertain whether the fire department will approve our remediation plan  whether additional revisions will be required and what  if any  costs we will incur 
the owner of the land lease covering the south building and a small part of the central annex has instituted a lawsuit to have the court declare that we defaulted under the land lease  which if adversely determined  would cause us to move from the south building and a portion of an annex to the north building which would involve a material cash capital expenditure and reduce the bed capacity to approximately beds 
regardless  if we successfully resolve the above problems  we may not have sufficient parking to operate either the current facility or simply the north building and the majority of the annex 
construction of a parking structure not only requires zoning approval which is a lengthy process  but also involves a material cost 
while we own an empty building in the city of miami which was operated by clinical pharmacology associates before our purchase of it in  we estimate that it would take six months to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and make structural improvements to operate that property as a phase i clinical trials facility 
presently  we have no intent to re open that property 
the issues affecting our miami facility and adverse publicity may also cause employees to leave us and subjects who participate in our phase i trials in miami may decline to do so in the future 
our attempts to resolve these issues involve a material amount of attention from our management  additional cost and uncertainty and may have a material and adverse affect on our future results of operations  including a reduction not only in our net earnings but a deviation from our forecasted net earnings 
moreover  we have been approached by a number of parties about purchasing the miami property we own 
our ability to sell this property for its actual value will be impacted by the uncertainty created by the land lease and the pending litigation as well as the perception that any sale may be required by our future failure to comply with local regulatory requirements 
in the event we were required to close the miami facility  we may not have the time or resources to complete the construction of a new building before losing all of the miami business to competitors or attrition 
while we are cooperating with the requests of the senate finance committee for documents and will produce current employees if their presence before the committee or its staff is requested  we are concerned that continued public disclosure could cause clients to withhold future work from us 
the united states senate finance committee has twice requested documents and or information from us and we have complied fully with its requests 
additionally  two of our former employees including our former president and chairman have voluntarily met with the committee s staff 
the public disclosure of the committee s requests has negatively affected our common stock price 
future activities by the committee and the public disclosure of such activities can again affect our common stock price and may cause clients to not 
table of contents award us contracts or cancel existing contracts 
moreover  future requests may involve substantial additional costs including legal fees and diversion of management time 
depending upon the outcome  the inquiry by the sec can result in our being sued by the sec and being subject to equitable relief including payment of a fine and civil monetary penalties 
in july  the nasd advised us that it had referred the review of trading in our common stock and options prior to the announcement of our acquisition of pharmanet to the sec 
in late december  the sec staff wrote to us requesting various documents principally relating to compensation payable to our former president and chairman  to compensation payable to our former vice president of legal affairs relating to his compensation and that of his family  to other information relating to the former officer s duties and to the independent counsel s report 
in addition  on march   the sec staff wrote to us requesting various documents principally relating to related party transactions  compensation of  and other arrangements with  family members of certain of our employees  internal control and other accounting policies  our initial public offering  our form k filed on june   transcripts of all analyst and investor conference calls and all minutes of all board meetings  including committee meetings  since january  presently  the sec s review is an informal inquiry which is less serious than a formal investigation in which the sec authorizes its staff to issue subpoenas and investigate certain activity 
in addition to the documents above  we do know that an investor whose name was submitted to us by the nasd received a telephone call in january from the sec staff inquiring about his purchases of sfbc securities and whether he had advance knowledge of the pharmanet acquisition 
that investor has never been our employee or our contractor 
we are uncertain whether the sec staff will seek to elevate its informal inquiries to a formal investigation or if it does  whether the sec will bring an action against us 
among its remedies are the filing of a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief requiring us to comply with the law and the imposition of fines and civil monetary penalties 
a lesser remedy would be to issue a report of investigation outlining activity considered to violate the law 
depending upon the outcome of the sec inquiry  we may sustain significant legal expenses and the costs and negative publicity related to a formal sec investigation could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
the pending fda open item and other fda inspections may cause clients not to award future contracts to us or cancel existing contracts  which may have a material and adverse affect on our future results of operations 
we presently are subject to one matter where the fda inspectional staff concluded that we have adequately addressed its form observations following its inspection of a study and no further action was required  whereas the division of scientific investigations recommended that the data generated from this study at our miami facility be disallowed in connection with an abbreviated new drug application 
additionally  we can expect continuing inspections of our facilities in connection with studies we have conducted in support of marketing applications or routine inspections of our offices facilities that have yet to be inspected by the fda 
the fda has significant authority over the conduct of clinical trials  and it has the power to take regulatory and legal action in response to violations of clinical standards and subject protection in the form of clinical holds on studies  civil and criminal fines  injunctions  and other measures 
if the fda issues clinical holds  or obtains injunctions  such actions could result in significant obstacles to future operations 
additionally  there is a risk that these fda actions  if they result in significant form observations  could cause clients to not award us future contracts or cancel existing contracts 
depending upon the amount of revenue lost  the results may have a material and adverse affect on our future results of operations  including a reduction not only in our net earnings but a deviation from our forecasted net earnings 
while we have insurance coverage in connection with the pending class actions  the potential adverse outcome may exceed our insurance coverage 
we are subject to a number of class actions in federal court which we expect will be consolidated into one case before a single judge 
subject to a  deductible  we expect our insurance carrier will pay all legal and other costs  any settlement amount and any adverse judgment  subject to the limits of the policies 
if the amount of defense costs and any agreed upon settlement or adverse judgment exceeds the insurance limits 
table of contents or if coverage were otherwise unavailable  our future earnings and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  litigation is generally time consuming  and can divert the attention of our management and other personnel 
if there is an adverse outcome in the securities class action lawsuits that have been filed against us  our business may be materially harmed 
further  defending against these and other lawsuits may be expensive and could divert the attention of our management 
a large number of securities class actions and derivative actions have been filed against us 
the securities class actions allege that we and certain of our former and current officers engaged in violations of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws 
the derivative suits are brought on behalf of sfbc against certain of its former and current officers and or directors alleging  among other things  breaches of fiduciary duty 
the complaints in these actions seek  among other things  unspecified damages and costs associated with the litigation 
as with any litigation proceeding  we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of these pending lawsuits 
furthermore  we will have to incur expenses in connection with these lawsuits  which may be substantial 
in the event of an adverse outcome  our business could be materially harmed 
moreover  responding to and defending the pending litigation could result in a significant diversion of management s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees 
if we are unable to stabilize our operations in miami  we may be unable to compete effectively in that area 
we understand that a competitor has opened a bed facility in the miami  florida area 
this represents the first significant local early stage competition since we purchased clinical pharmacology associates two and one half years ago 
if clients are concerned about the issues referred to in many of the above risk factors or if our employees and subjects are attracted to this new competitor  we may not be able to compete effectively  in which case our future net earnings may be reduced and our common stock price will fall 
additionally  this new competition may adversely affect our ability to recruit subjects 
the risks set forth immediately above as well as those in the balance of these risk factors may cause us not to meet our or future earnings guidance  which could cause our stock price to fall substantially 
we regularly provide earnings guidance in press releases and in public conference calls 
this guidance is not incorporated by reference into this report 
the guidance is made in a good faith belief that we will achieve the range of net revenue and earnings per share we forecast 
we very recently revised our guidance which was based upon  among other things  a review of the business at the miami and other facilities 
that guidance was based upon a consideration of the relevant risks and a full review of our business units as well as our anticipated outside legal and other expenses as of the date of the review 
depending upon future events including the status of our miami facility and property as well as clients perceptions about doing business with us  we may not achieve the forecasted results 
if we fail to do so  our revisions of our guidance or our announcement of our earnings may cause our common stock price to fall  which decline may be material 
our forecasts reflect numerous assumptions concerning our expected performance  as well as other factors  which are beyond our control  and which might not turn out to be correct 
although we believe that the assumptions underlying our projections are reasonable  actual results could be materially different 
our financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those identified throughout these risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our business we have grown rapidly over the last few years  and our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on us 
we have grown rapidly over the last six years  including through acquisitions 
businesses that grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth 
our rapid growth has placed and is expected to continue 
table of contents to place significant demands on our management  on our accounting  financial  information and other systems and on our business 
although we have expanded our management  we need to continue recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees capable of providing the necessary support 
in addition  we will need to continue to improve our financial  accounting  information and other systems in order to effectively manage our growth 
in particular  our late stage clinical trial management business faces stiff competition for clinical trial monitors and other experienced personnel 
historically  when making acquisitions  we have targeted operations that we believe can be operated as autonomous business units 
as the result of the problems in miami and our change in senior management  we have reorganized and are now managing our operations on a more centralized basis from our princeton  new jersey headquarters 
this prior decentralization of our operations and systems may create difficulties for us in the future 
all of our north american subsidiaries  with the exception of pharmanet and anapharm  have a common accounting software platform 
we cannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growth and integrate acquired businesses effectively or successfully  or that our financial  accounting  information or other systems will be able to successfully accommodate our external and internal growth 
our failure to meet these challenges could materially impair our business 
a significant portion of our growth has come from acquisitions  and we may make more acquisitions in the future as part of our continuing growth strategy 
this growth strategy subjects us to numerous risks 
a very important aspect of our growth strategy has been and continues to be pursuing strategic acquisitions of related businesses that we believe can expand or complement our business 
since march  we have substantially grown our business through the completion of acquisitions 
we did not complete any acquisitions in  but we are continuing to explore future acquisitions 
acquisitions require significant capital resources and divert management s attention from our existing business 
acquisitions also entail an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct pre dating our acquisition of a business that were not known to us at the time of acquisition 
we may also incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired business than we had anticipated at the time of its purchase 
in addition  acquisitions may create unanticipated tax and accounting problems  including the possibility that we might be required to write off goodwill which we have paid for in connection with an acquisition 
a key element of our acquisition strategy has been to retain management of acquired businesses to operate the acquired business for us 
many of these individuals maintain important contacts with clients of the acquired business 
our inability to retain these individuals could materially impair the value of an acquired business 
our failure to successfully identify and consummate future acquisitions or to manage and integrate the acquisitions we make could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  we will receive the required consent under our outstanding credit facility  we can consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms  we can successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or successfully manage the operations of any acquired business  or we will be able to retain an acquired company s significant client relationships  goodwill and key personnel or otherwise realize the intended benefits of any acquisition 
our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that  absent the consent of the administrative agent on behalf of the lenders under the credit facility  limit our ability to enter into acquisitions by setting limits on the maximum aggregate amounts of cash we can pay in acquisition consideration in any fiscal year and the maximum aggregate amount of all acquisition consideration paid during the term of the credit facility  as well as restricting the terms of equity consideration paid in acquisitions 

table of contents we are subject to changes in outsourcing trends and regulatory requirements affecting the branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device industries which could adversely affect our operating results 
economic factors and industry and regulatory trends that affect our primary clients  branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug and medical device companies  also affect our business and operating results 
the outsourcing of drug development activities grew substantially during the past decade and we benefited from this trend 
if these industries reduce the outsourcing of their clinical research and other drug development projects  our operations will be adversely affected 
a continuing negative trend could have an ongoing adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
numerous governments have undertaken efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation  regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and pharmaceutical companies 
potential regulatory changes under consideration include the mandatory substitution of generic drugs for innovator drugs  relaxation in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures 
if future regulatory cost containment efforts limit the profits which can be derived from new and generic drugs or if regulatory approval standards are relaxed  our clients may reduce the business they outsource to us 
we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these events 
if branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  generic drug or medical device companies reduce their expenditures  our future revenue and profitability may be reduced 
our business and continued expansion depend on the research and development expenditures of our clients which in turn is impacted by their profitability 
if these companies want to reduce costs  they may proceed with fewer clinical trials and other drug development 
an economic downturn or other factors may cause our clients to decrease their research and development expenditures which would adversely affect our future revenue and profitability 
if we do not continue to generate a large number of new client contracts  or if our clients cancel or defer contracts  our future profitability may be adversely affected 
our early stage contracts are short term and our late stage contracts generally extend over a period of one to two years  although some may be of longer duration 
however  all of our contracts are generally cancelable by our clients with little or no notice 
a client may cancel or delay existing contracts with us at its discretion and is likely to do so for a variety of reasons  including manufacturing problems resulting in a shortage or unavailability of the drug we are testing  a decision by a client to de emphasize or cancel the development of a drug  unexpected clinical trial results  adverse participant reaction to a drug  an action by regulatory authorities for example  in the united states  the fda  and in canada  the tpd  continued publicity relating to the senate finance committee s interest in our miami facility  inadequate participant enrollment  and any of the factors discussed in the other risk factors relating to issues regarding our miami facility 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we must continually replace our existing contracts with new contracts to sustain our revenue 
our inability to generate new contracts on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  since a large portion of our operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing and progress of contracts can materially affect our financial results 
the loss or delay of a large project or contract or the loss or delay of multiple smaller contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced termination  cancellation and delay of contracts by clients from time to 
table of contents time in the past in the ordinary course of our business 
moreover  our miami facility has recently lost business and clients as described in item issues relating to our miami facility of this report 
at any given time  one or a limited number of clients may account for a large percentage of our revenue  which means that we could face a greater risk of loss of revenue if we lose a major client 
historically  a small number of clients have generated a large percentage of our net revenue in any given period 
in each of  and  no client provided more than of our direct revenue  but our largest clients provided approximately  and  respectively  of our direct revenue 
pharmanet also relies on a limited number of clients which generate a significant percentage of its direct revenue 
during  and direct revenue from four of pharmanet s clients  provided approximately  and of pharmanet s direct revenue  respectively 
companies that constitute our largest clients vary from year to year  and our direct revenue from individual clients fluctuates each year 
if we lose one or more major clients in the future or if one or more clients encounter financial difficulties  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may bear financial risk if we under price our contracts or overrun cost estimates 
we bear the financial risk if we initially under price our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates 
such under pricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we are not able to remediate the material weaknesses relating to our internal controls or if we incur further instances of breakdowns in our internal controls  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the price of our common stock 
in connection with the internal control audit for the year ended december   our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that two material weaknesses existed 
we have taken two steps to remediate both material weaknesses  which related to too many adjusting entries and the failure to identity and evaluate as well as disclose certain related party information to our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm 
in  we have hired additional accounting personnel to address the first material weakness 
in late december  our board of directors adopted a resolution requiring all related party transactions be first approved by our audit committee and then by the full board of directors 
recently we amended our code of ethics to require our human resources department to approve in writing the hiring of all employees 
human resources will make the appropriate related party inquiries and forward the information when appropriate to the audit committee 
we believe these remediation efforts will enhance our ability to identity and evaluate and disclose related party transactions to our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm and thereby remediate the second material weakness 
while remediating these material weaknesses is a very high priority for our management and our audit committee  we cannot assure you that our independent registered public accounting firm will agree with our management s assessment that we have remediated them or that we will not encounter further instances of breakdowns in our internal control over financial reporting 
public disclosure of these material weaknesses or a failure to promptly complete our remediation effort could cause our common stock price to fall 
moreover  no matter how good a system of internal control is  it can be circumvented by people who engage in improper action 
in such event  our results of operations could be distorted 
if the improper activity is material  once discovered and publicly disclosed  our common stock price could materially decline 
our indebtedness may impact our financial condition and results of operations and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness may limit our activities 
on december   we had approximately million of consolidated indebtedness 
subject to applicable restrictions in our outstanding indebtedness  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 

table of contents our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation we may be required to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest due on our outstanding indebtedness  our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase the impact of negative changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as competitive pressures  and the level of our outstanding indebtedness may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
million of our current outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate tied to libor and million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at a fixed rate of per year 
accordingly  if interest rates increase  whether generally or as the result of our lender s requirement in connection with a proposed amendment  then the amount of the interest payments on our floating rate indebtedness will also increase 
general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control  may affect our future performance 
as a result  these and other factors may affect our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
our business might not continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
moreover  if we are required to repatriate foreign earnings in order to pay our debt service  we may incur additional income taxes 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness  we may  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  or reduce or delay planned capital expenditures 
these measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness 
in addition  any financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms  if at all 
furthermore  our credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which will affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  make investments or loans  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  issue capital stock  make capital expenditures  sell assets  and pursue mergers or acquisitions 
as of the date of this report  we cannot borrow further on the revolving line of credit which is part of our credit facility 
we recently received a waiver of certain violations under the credit facility as of december  we are seeking to amend the credit facility to permit us to re borrow under it  but cannot assure you we will be successful 
additionally  we are in violation of certain credit facility covenants at march  for the reasons expressed under liquidity in item of this report 

table of contents we may not have sufficient funds to pay the principal return upon conversion or to repurchase our outstanding convertible senior notes under circumstances when we are required to do so 
we have outstanding million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time 
the initial conversion rate of the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes 
this is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
however  the notes provide for what is known as net share settlement upon conversion 
this means that upon conversion of the notes  we will be required to pay up to  in cash  per  principal amount of notes  and  if applicable  issue a number of shares of our common stock based upon the conversion value in excess of the principal amount 
the conversion value of the notes is based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock for the ten trading day period commencing the second trading day after we receive notice of conversion 
the conversion value must be paid as soon as practicable after it is determined 
in addition  holders of the notes may require us to purchase their notes for cash on august   august  and august  and  under certain circumstances  in the event of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture under which the notes were issued 
further  if a fundamental change occurs prior to august   we will be required to pay a make whole premium in addition to the repurchase price which may be payable at our election in cash or shares of our common stock  valued at of the then current market price  or a combination of both 
we may not have sufficient funds at any such time to make the required payment upon conversion or to purchase the notes and we may not be able to raise sufficient funds to satisfy our obligations 
furthermore  the terms of our existing credit facility contains  and the terms of other indebtedness that we may incur in the future may contain  financial covenants or other provisions that could be violated by payment of the required amounts upon conversion or the repurchase of the notes 
our failure to pay the required amounts on conversion of any of the notes when converted or to repurchase any of the notes when we are required to do so would result in an event of default with respect to the notes  which could result in the entire outstanding principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest on all of the notes being accelerated and could also result in an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness 
our operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period 
our operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations are usually due to the level of new business awards in a particular period and the timing of the initiation  progress  or cancellation of significant projects 
even a short acceleration or delay in such projects could have a material effect on our results in a given reporting period 
varying periodic results could adversely affect the price of our common stock if investors react to our reporting operating results which are less favorable than in a prior period or than those anticipated by investors or the financial community generally 
if we are required to write off goodwill or other intangible assets  our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected 
for the year ended december   we incurred a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million relating to our miami operations 
this had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year 
we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million and million after deducting the impairment charge as of december  and december   respectively  which constituted approximately and  respectively  of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our business is subject to international economic  political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside the united states 
further  we anticipate that revenue from international operations may grow in the future 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  including less stable political and economic environments and changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  potential negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting our ability to repatriate profits  unfavorable labor regulations  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  currency fluctuations  changes in trade policies  regulatory requirements and other barriers  civil unrest or other catastrophic events  and longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions 
these factors are beyond our control 
the realization of any of these or other risks associated with operating in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our substantial non united states operations expose us to currency risks 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar  euros or other foreign currencies and the us dollar could materially affect the translation of our subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
due to the acquisition of pharmanet  which has locations worldwide  we are subject to exchange rate gains and losses for multiple currencies 
we also may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk when our service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which we incur expenses or earn fees related to such contracts 
for example  our canadian operations often perform services for a fixed price denominated in us dollars or in euros while their payroll and other expenses are primarily canadian dollar expenses 
in  we adopted a formal foreign currency risk hedging policy to attempt to mitigate this risk in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in limiting risks associated with foreign currency transactions 
although we initiated hedging transactions in to seek to mitigate our foreign currency risks  none of the individual transactions were material 
we incurred a pre tax loss from foreign currency transactions relating to our foreign operations for the year of approximately million or per diluted share after taxes 
we could be adversely affected by tax law changes in canada or in other jurisdictions 
our operations in canada currently benefit from favorable corporate tax arrangements 
we receive substantial tax credits in canada from both the canadian federal and quebec governments 
our canadian operations employ a large number of research and development employees which results in significant expenses related to these services 
due to the nature of these services  the canadian government subsidizes a portion of these expenses through tax credits that result in a reduced effective tax rate as well as a significant deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
however  there is no assurance that the credits will be fully realized 
further  any reduction in the availability or amount of these tax credits could have a material adverse effect on our profits and cash flow from our canadian operations 
additionally  a large part of our net earnings is generated outside of the united states  where tax rates are generally lower 
if applicable foreign tax rates  particularly in canada and switzerland  increase  it will reduce our consolidated net earnings 

table of contents governmental authorities may question our inter company transfer pricing policies or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax or otherwise harm our business 
as a united states company doing business in international markets through subsidiaries  we are subject to foreign tax and inter company pricing laws  including those relating to the flow of funds between our company and our subsidiaries 
regulators in the united states and in foreign markets closely monitor our corporate structure and how we effect inter company fund transfers 
if regulators challenge our corporate structure  transfer pricing mechanisms or inter company transfers  our operations may be negatively impacted and our effective tax rate may increase 
tax rates vary from country to country and if regulators determine that our profits in one jurisdiction may need to be increased  we may not be able to fully utilize all foreign tax credits that are generated  which would increase our effective tax rate 
we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with all applicable customs  exchange control and transfer pricing laws despite our efforts to be aware of and to comply with such laws 
further  if these laws change  we may need to adjust our operating procedure and our business could be adversely affected 
because we are smaller than our largest competitors  we may lack the resources needed to compete effectively 
there are a large number of drug development services companies ranging in size from one person firms to full service  global drug development corporations 
intense competition may lead to price pressure or other conditions that could adversely affect our business 
some of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial  human and other resources 
we may lack the operating and financial resources needed to compete effectively 
if we do not continue to develop new assay methods for our analytical applications  we may be unable to compete with other entities offering bioanalytical laboratory services 
we must continuously develop assay methods to test drug products in order to meet the needs of our clients and attract new clients 
in order to substantially increase the business of our bioanalytical laboratories  which provide services for branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug companies  we must be able to provide solutions for our clients 
this requires staying abreast of current regulatory requirements and identifying methods and applications that will assist our clients in obtaining approval for their products 
if we are not successful in developing new methods and applications  we may lose our clients 
we risk potential liability when conducting clinical trials  which could cost us large amounts of money 
our clinical trials involve administering drugs to humans in order to determine the effects of the drugs 
by doing so  we are subject to the general risks of liability to these persons  which include those relating to adverse side effects and reactions resulting from administering these drugs to a clinical trial participant  unintended consequences resulting from the procedures and or changes in medical practice to which a study participant may be subject as part of a clinical trial  improper administration of these drugs  or potential professional malpractice of our employees or contractors  including physicians 
our contracts may not have adequate indemnification agreements requiring our clients to indemnify us in the event of adverse consequences to our participants caused by their drugs or participation in their trials 
we also carry liability insurance but there is no certainty as to the adequacy  or the continued availability at rates acceptable to us  of such liability insurance 
we could also be held liable for other errors or omissions in connection with our services 
for example  we could be held liable for errors or omissions or breach of contract if our laboratories inaccurately report or fail to report lab results 
if we do not perform our services to contractual or regulatory standards  the clinical trial process could be adversely affected 
additionally  if clinical trial services such as laboratory analysis do not conform to contractual or regulatory standards  trial participants could be affected 
if there is a damage claim not covered by insurance  the indemnification 
table of contents agreement is not enforceable or broad enough  or our client is insolvent  any resulting award against us could result in our experiencing large losses 
we face a risk of liability from our handling and disposal of medical wastes  which could cause us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect us 
our clinical trial activities and laboratory services involve the controlled disposal of medical wastes  which are considered hazardous materials 
although we may use reputable third parties to dispose of medical waste  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if this occurs  we could be held liable for clean up costs  damages  face significant fines  and face the temporary or permanent shutdown of our operations 
failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations could harm our operating results and reputation 
we may be subject to regulatory action  which in some jurisdictions includes criminal sanctions  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
failure to comply can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials 
this could harm our reputation  our prospects for future work and our operating results 
a finding by the fda that we are not in compliance with glp standards for our laboratories  current gmp standards  and or gcp standards for our clinical facilities could materially and adversely affect us 
similarly  a finding by the tpd that we are not in compliance with canadian good manufacturing practices  or canadian gmp  standards  and or canadian good clinical practices  or canadian gcps  and or other legislative requirements for clinical trials in canada  could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition to the above united states and canadian laws and regulations  we must comply with the laws of all countries where we do business  including laws governing clinical trials in the jurisdiction where the trials are performed 
failure to comply with applicable requirements could subject us to regulatory risk  liability and potential costs associated with redoing the trials which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
if we lose the services of our key personnel or are unable to attract qualified staff  our business could be adversely affected 
our success is substantially dependent upon the performance  contributions and expertise of our senior management team  including  among others  mr 
jeffrey p 
mcmullen  sfbc s chief executive officer  the executive committee comprised of members  and our divisional presidents and key vice presidents companywide 
in addition  some members of our senior management team play a very significant role in the generation of new business and retention of existing clients 
we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management  professional and operating staff 
our loss of the services of any of the members of senior management  or any other key executive  or our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information technology infrastructure  and failures of this infrastructure could harm our operations 
to remain competitive in our industry  we must employ information technologies that capture  manage  and analyze the large streams of data generated during our clinical trials in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
in addition  because we provide services on a global basis  we rely extensively on our technology to allow the concurrent conduct of studies and work sharing around the world 
as with all information technology  our system is vulnerable to potential damage or interruptions from fires  blackouts  telecommunications failures  and other unexpected events  as well as to break ins  sabotage  or intentional acts of vandalism 
given the extensive reliance of our business on this technology  any substantial disruption or resulting loss of data that is not avoided or corrected by our backup measures could harm our business and operations 

table of contents risks related to our common stock we may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future which could cause dilution to new investors and otherwise adversely affect our stock price 
an element of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions 
as part of our acquisition strategy  we may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisitions 
these issuances could be significant 
to the extent that we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration  your equity interest in us will be diluted 
any such issuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future 
persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be likely to sell off their common stock rather than hold their shares for investment  which may impact the price of our common stock 
in addition  the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained 
we plan to issue common stock  for compensation purposes and in connection with strategic transactions or for other purposes 
recent changes in accounting standards could limit the desirability of granting stock options  which could harm our ability to attract and retain employees  and could also negatively impact our results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board is requiring all companies to treat the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense effective for the first interim reporting period that begins after june  this change became effective for us on january  we and other companies are required to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option granted over its vesting period 
previously  we were generally not required to record compensation expense in connection with employee stock option grants 
we believe this change may reduce the attractiveness of granting stock options because of the additional expense associated with these grants  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
for example  had we been required to expense stock option grants by applying the measurement provisions of statement r  our recorded net earnings for the years ended december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  would have been reduced to approximately million and a loss of million  respectively 
stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 
because statement r did not apply to vested options as of december   in we accelerated the vesting of  out of the money options held by pharmanet executives and issued  vested options to employees  none of whom are executive officers and directors 
beginning in  we plan to eliminate or reduce issuance of stock options and issue lesser amounts of restricted stock or restricted stock units which involve less dilution  but generally result in income taxation to employees who receive grants  unless delivery is deferred into the future 
regardless of whether we issue options or restricted stock  our future results of operations will be negatively impacted 
our stock price can be extremely volatile  and your investment could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to be  volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  including changes in our guidance as to forecasted earnings  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  media articles such as the bloomberg reports  adverse events arising in connection with our miami facility including events related to the property  loss of a major client or contract  new service offerings introduced or announced by our competitors  
table of contents changes in market valuations of other similar companies  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of our common stock  including short sales 
as a result  investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in addition  the stock market in general experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult  which could depress our stock price 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
our charter documents provide that our board of directors may issue  without a vote of our stockholders  one or more series of preferred stock that has more than one vote per share 
this could permit our board of directors to issue preferred stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management 
additionally  issuance of preferred stock could block an acquisition resulting in both a drop in the price of our common stock and a decline in interest in the stock  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to sell their shares 
this could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is performing well 
our bylaws also limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders and establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
in addition  provisions of certain contracts  such as employment agreements with our executive officers  may have an anti takeover effect 
in december  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan  which has the effect of deterring hostile takeovers 
additionally  we adopted an amendment to our bylaws  which temporarily requires holders who own or more of our common stock to call a special meeting of stockholders 
on january   the required percentage drops back to

in july  the national association of securities dealers  inc  or nasd  advised us that it had referred to the securities and exchange commission  or sec  its files relating to its review of trading activity in our stock prior to our november  announcement of our proposed acquisition of pharmanet 
we had previously been advised that the nasd amex regulation division conducted a similar review with regard to our options  but are unaware of the extent of that review 
we cooperated with the nasd in connection with these reviews  but have not been contacted by the sec staff with regard to the nasd reviews 
we do not believe that any of our management or employees who had knowledge of the pharmanet acquisition engaged in any trading of our stock or options based upon non public information about the acquisition 
we have received two requests from the sec staff which are explained in detail on page of this report 
we have cooperated fully with the sec in this matter and will continue to do so 
for further information on this matter  see item a 
risk factors 
in january  the owner of the land upon which part of our miami facility is located commenced an action against us seeking a judgment declaring that we breached the land lease 
the complaint  as amended  alleges that the defaults include issues alleged in the bloomberg reports  the structural  building and fire code issues raised by the miami dade county building department  the pending or sec commission staff inquiry and failure to maintain insurance naming the owner as a co insured 
we have denied that the allegations in the complaint constitute defaults under the lease  and have asserted multiple defenses including that to forfeit the leasehold at this time with approximately years remaining on the lease would be inequitable 
we intend to deny all charges in the amended complaint which added the fire code allegation 
if the court nonetheless issues a declaratory judgment in favor of the plaintiff  we will be required to vacate the south building and the part of the annex on the leased land 
beginning in december  a number of class action lawsuits have been filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and the united states district court for the district of new jersey alleging that sfbc and certain of its current and former officers and directors violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  and rule b thereunder 
the suits allege that the defendants misrepresented sfbc s business conditions  prospects and financial results and failed to disclose sfbc s allegedly improper and reckless business practices  such as improper recruiting practices and mismanagement of clinical trials 
the class action complaints purport to have been brought by one of two proposed classes those who purchased sfbc common stock from august  through december  or from february  through december  the actions in the southern district of florida have been consolidated and a motion to transfer them to the district of new jersey has been filed 
a motion to consolidate the actions in the district of new jersey is pending 
sfbc intends to vigorously defend against these class actions 
based on the information currently available  management does not believe that the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or business of the company 
however  as the outcome of this matter is difficult to predict  significant changes in the estimated exposures could occur 
beginning in late  a number of stockholder derivative complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  the united states court for the district of new jersey and the circuit court of miami dade county  florida against certain current and former officers and directors of sfbc  as well as sfbc as a nominal defendant for violations of state and federal law  including breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment  disgorgement under the sarbanes oxley act of and violation of section a of the securities exchange act of these complaints alleged that the individual defendants misrepresented and engaged in a

the derivative actions pending in the southern district of florida have been consolidated and a motion to transfer them to the district of new jersey is pending 
the individuals named as defendants intend to vigorously defend against these derivative actions 
based on the information currently available  management does not believe that the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or business of the company

on april   mcc analitica  sa  or mcc  filed a private criminal complaint in barcelona  spain  alleging that defendant dr 
maria cruz caturla perales  a former employee of mcc  who is now an employee and owner of sfbc anapharm europe  sl  misappropriated confidential materials and utilized those materials at sfbc anapharm europe 
we  through sfbc europe bv  own a interest in sfbc anapharm europe 
also named in the private proceedings were drs 
gregory holmes and marc lebel as legal representatives of sfbc anapharm europe 
there are no allegations that dr 
holmes or dr 
lebel participated in the alleged actions or knew of them 
spanish law provides that private individuals may file a criminal complaint and an examining judge then conducts an investigation to determine whether further proceedings are warranted 
we were not named as a party to the proceedings 
spanish counsel has advised us that  in such counsel s opinion  it is unlikely that either we or our subsidiary  sfbc europe bv  will have liability including possible civil liability 
however  there can be no assurances that either we or our subsidiary will not have any liability 
in addition  while we believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the business of our joint venture or our investment therein  there can be no assurances as to that effect 
in november  our spanish counsel notified us that the criminal investigation court dismissed the proceeding

overview prior to  we grew significantly through organic growth and acquisitions 
in  we did not complete any acquisitions 
our organic revenue growth was approximately in in spite of a significant reduction of revenues in the second half of the year at our miami facility 
excluding the impact of a one time non cash goodwill impairment charge of million at our miami facility  and despite a reduction in profitability at our miami facility  we experienced strong earnings from operation at pharmanet  anapharm and all of our other subsidiaries excluding ft 
myers 
the table below reflects the length of time each of our principal operating subsidiaries operated during each year for which we present audited financial statements in this report 
number of months each principal operating subsidiary is included in operating results sfbc miami sfbc ft 
myers sfbc analytical anapharm sfbc charlotte sfbc new drug services clinical pharmacology associates sfbc new drug services canada sfbc taylor technology pharmanet we merged sfbc charlotte into sfbc new drug services in april in  the former sfbc new drug services was divided into two entities 
the early stage portion was operated as a stand alone entity  clinical pharmacology services 
the late stage portion was merged into pharmanet operations 
included in sfbc miami 
sfbc new drug services canada was a subsidiary of sfbc from march  through june and its results were reported during that time using the equity method 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet on december   pharmanet s net revenue and operating expenses excluding amortization of intangibles during the nine day period had a net neutral effect on net earnings and were not included in our financial results for highlights for include our direct revenue increased to approximately million from approximately million  our net earnings decreased from approximately million to approximately million primarily as a result of a one time non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million incurred in our miami operations  
table of contents our earnings per share decreased from to per share primarily as a result of a one time non cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  incurred in our miami operations  we reduced the amount borrowed on our credit facility from million to million primarily as a result of our march public offering and we incurred non cash write offs of deferred financing charges of approximately million as a result of this paydown and amendments on our credit facility  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  we purchased land in quebec city  canada intended to house a new expanded facility for anapharm s operations  excluding allocation of corporate overhead  our late stage subsidiary  pharmanet  which we acquired on december   had recorded direct revenue of million and pre tax earnings of approximately million in pre tax profits from operations which includes a loss of approximately million from the merged operations of sfbc new drug services and the late stage canadian business  excluding allocation of corporate overhead  anapharm had record direct revenue of million and pre tax earnings of million  our miami operations were significantly affected by the events described in item of this report which resulted in a million impairment charge 
the events also led to an approximate million severance charge 
additionally  we incurred additional legal costs of approximately million resulting to the events which affected this facility  while our miami subsidiary s direct revenue increased by approximately to million  its direct revenue and earnings from operations fell significantly in the second half of the year  particularly in the fourth quarter 
our net revenue consists primarily of fees earned for services performed under contracts with branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology and generic drug company clients 
typically  a portion of our contract fee is due upon signing of the contract  and the majority of the contract fee is generally paid in installments upon the achievement of certain agreed upon performance milestones 
because pharmanet s contracts are generally larger and longer in duration  it typically receives larger advance payments 
our contracts are generally terminable immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts usually require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  fees earned to date  and in some cases a termination fee 
prior to the acquisition of pharmanet  since most of our contracts were early stage trials which are of short duration  we did not experience any significant terminations of contracts in progress 
pharmanet  whose trials are primarily late stage  typically performs services under long term contracts which are subject to a greater risk of delay or cancellation 
pharmanet believes that its late stage cancellation rate for and was below industry averages 
there can be no assurances that material cancellations will not occur in the future 
in our long term late stage contracts we have historically reported net revenue  which amounts include any reimbursed out of pocket expenses consisting of travel and other expenses 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  beginning in we began reporting revenue line items consisting of direct revenue and reimbursed out of pockets  together with an expense line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses which will consist of travel and other expenses for which we are reimbursed by our clients 
as described separately above  in we began recording our recurring operating expenses in three primary categories direct costs  selling  general and administrative expenses and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs consist primarily of participant fees and associated expenses  direct labor and employee benefits  facility costs  depreciation associated with facilities and equipment used in conducting trials  and other costs and materials directly related to contracts 
direct costs as a percentage of net revenue vary from period to period  due to the varying mix of contracts and services performed and to the percentage of revenue arising from our canadian operations  which generally have higher direct costs 
selling  general 
table of contents and administrative costs consist primarily of administrative payroll except for pharmanet and overhead  advertising and public relations expense  legal and accounting expense  travel  depreciation and amortization related to amortizable intangibles 
pharmanet includes all payroll related costs as part of direct costs  and all office costs and depreciation as part of selling  general and administrative costs 
the gross profit margins on our contracts vary depending upon the nature of the services we perform for our clients 
gross profit margins for our early stage clinical development trials and bioanalytical services generally tend to be higher than those for our late stage trials  management and other services that we perform 
within our early stage business  our gross profit margins are generally higher for trials which involve a larger number of participants  a longer period of study time and or the performance of more tests 
gross profit margins for our services to branded drug clients generally tend to be higher than those for generic drug clients 
in addition  our gross profit margins will vary based upon our mix of domestic and international business 
gross profit margins are calculated by dividing the gross margin excluding by direct revenue 
excluding the impact of our non cash impairment charge of million which created no tax benefit  our effective tax rate was in  in  and in in our tax rate dropped significantly due to the increased interest expense  and a greater proportion of earnings generated from outside of the united states than in previous years 
these earnings came primarily in canada where anapharm operates and in europe where pharmanet operates and generates significant revenue 
our future effective tax rate will be dependent on the amount of the tax credits we receive in connection with our canadian operations  our income overseas where pharmanet operates  statutory tax rates in those overseas jurisdictions and the relative contribution of our domestic and foreign operations to our consolidated pre tax income 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of sfbc s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and sfbc s actual results are subject to the risk factors contained at the end of this section 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity revenue and cost recognition 
revenue from contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
through  due to the predominately early stage nature of our clinical trials  revenue has generally been earned under contracts of short term duration 
our early stage contracts generally contain a budget on a per subject basis or sample tested basis 
however  as the work progresses  our clients frequently modify the scope of our contracts which results in changes to the budget 
our later stage contracts  including many of pharmanet s contracts  generally average approximately two years in duration but they can extend for multiple years 
with these long term  fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed on a percentage of completion basis 
generally  with long term contracts  a portion of the contract fee is paid prior to the time the trial is initiated 
we recognize revenue from these advances only when services are actually performed 
additional payments may also be made based upon the achievement of milestones over the contract duration 
in the event a contract is terminated  most of our contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to terminate the study  fees earned to date and  in some cases  a termination fee or a payment to us of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by us under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
termination fees are included in net revenue when realization is assured 

table of contents contracts may contain provisions for renegotiation in the event of cost overruns due to changes in the level of work scope 
renegotiated amounts are included in revenue when earned and realization is assured 
provisions for losses to be incurred on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which it is determined that a loss will result from performance of the contractual arrangement 
direct costs include all direct costs related to contract performance and  in the case of pharmanet  all payroll related costs 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as they are incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is possible that the estimates used will change in the near term and that the change could be material 
the uncertainties which can affect our estimates include changes in scope of contracts and unforeseen costs which cannot be billed to the client such as increased costs associated with recruiting special populations for studies 
in the past  our estimates of these uncertainties have not materially affected our revenue or cost recognition  and we do not anticipate making material changes to our method of estimating costs in the future 
as described in the overview above  included in revenue and direct costs are pass through costs for which we are reimbursed by our clients 
because these amounts became material due to our acquisition of pharmanet  we now comply with eitf and provide a separate line item for reimbursed out of pockets under revenue and a separate line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses under direct costs 
included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts  which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for contract changes is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of our clients  analysis of subsequent changes in contracts  analysis of delinquent accounts  the payment histories of the accounts and management s judgment with respect to current economic conditions 
management believes the allowances are sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management reviews our accounts receivable aging on a regular basis for past due accounts 
any uncollectible amounts are written off against the allowance 
management maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historic collectibility and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major client default on its obligations to us  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
the allowance for changes in contracts is an estimate established through reductions to revenue while the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate established through charges to selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have not made any material adjustments as a result of non payment of accounts receivable 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of our valuation allowance  if necessary 
as a result of our acquisition of pharmanet  we now maintain offices in countries 
we are subject to audit in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
due to the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
as a result of the acquisition of pharmanet  our balance sheet reflects certain valuation allowances related to our ability to realize foreign tax loss carryforwards as of december  if the estimates utilized in connection with establishing the valuation allowance prove inaccurate  resulting increases or decreases in the valuation allowance could be required in the future 
any future changes in valuation allowance can have a material impact on our net earnings 
based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we have determined that a valuation allowance of approximately  was required for specific foreign entities 

table of contents pharmanet has been  and in the future may be  a party to foreign tax proceedings 
we have established an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for potential adverse outcomes in future tax proceedings which would have an impact on the amount of goodwill reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
also  any future foreign tax proceedings would have an impact on our results of operations if our estimates prove to be inadequate 
it is possible that changes in our estimates in the future could cause us to either materially increase or decrease the amount of our income tax reserve 
with regard to earnings from foreign operations  our policy is to generally retain such earnings in the country in which they were generated 
this permits us to reduce the material united states income tax liabilities which would generally arise upon repatriation of these earnings 
in order to provide certain flexibility  we have structured our canadian and spanish operations to permit us to pay significant sums without united states income tax liability 
in  we repatriated funds of approximately million from canada on a tax free basis 
pharmanet has not taken any similar action to date 
goodwill 
on an annual basis  management assesses the composition of our assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
we will recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognized an impairment charge of million relating to our miami operations resulting from the write down of the goodwill related to our acquisition of clinical pharmacology associates in impairment of assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
to date  we have not recognized an impairment charge of this nature 
in the future  we will recognize an impairment if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
stock based compensation 
we have granted stock options to our employees at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounted for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the statement of operations 
because we recognized that apb was in the process of being rescinded  in we amended our stock option plan to provide for the granting of restricted stock and other forms of equity compensation in addition to stock options 
in december  apb was superseded by financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which will be effective for all annual accounting periods beginning after july  we adopted statement r effective as of january   and will be required to recognize an expense for the fair value of our outstanding stock options 
under statement r  we must determine the transition method to be used at the date of adoption  the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments and the amortization method for compensation cost 
we adopted the prospective method 
the prospective option requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of statement r 
the transition method requires management to make accounting estimates 
other estimates 
we make a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to volume rebates  litigation  etc 
historically  changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table summarizes our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of direct revenue for and in thousands  except per share data direct revenue direct costs sg a goodwill impairment interest expense net earnings before taxes and minority interest minority interest in joint venture income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted the earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the may three for two stock split as a stock dividend 
direct revenue our direct revenue  which does not include out of pocket expenses  was approximately million for the year ended december   which is an increase of approximately from approximately million for the prior year 
the primary components of this increase are pharmanet contributed approximately million in direct revenue  an increase in anapharm s direct revenue from million to approximately million in direct revenue  a significant increase in our early stage direct revenue in miami from approximately million to million 
however  of the net revenue came in the first half  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter  and a full year of operations at taylor technology  inc which we acquired in july our direct revenue increased primarily as the result of performing or managing more clinical trials and testing more samples  increases in the size of clinical trials and price increases 
our early stage clinical trial business benefited both from strong internal growth 
we have again seen an increasing number of new clients in our early stage clinical trials business in canada  we saw the same trend in our miami facility until the fourth quarter when certain events had  and continue to have  an adverse impact 
the improvement in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar contributed to our increased net revenue and direct revenue  although as discussed below  the strengthening of the canadian dollar had a negative impact on our results of operations in in  the euro strengthened compared to the united states dollar which had a negative impact on revenue compared to however  it also had an offsetting positive impact to expenses 

table of contents direct costs direct costs as a percentage of direct revenue increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the direct costs of pharmanet and significant increase in direct costs at our miami facility 
our late stage business at pharmanet generally has higher direct costs than our early stage business 
direct revenue in miami increased substantially in the first half of  and as a result we increased our personnel significantly 
we did not begin to reduce our staff in miami until late december because we believed that the reduction in revenue in the second half was temporary 
once we realized that the deadline was not temporary  we began to reduce personnel in miami 
if revenue in miami further declines  we will not be able to make similar staffing reductions and therefore the percentage of direct costs as a percentage of direct revenue would increase 
on a going forward basis we expect that direct cost as a percentage of direct revenue will vary due to the mix of contracts within our early stage and late stage business 
gross profit margins our gross profit margins were in compared to in our gross profit margins declined in with the addition of pharmanet s late stage business which has higher average employee compensation 
also  our miami subsidiary had significant declines in its gross profit margins compared to historic levels due to its additional staffing inconsistent with lower revenue levels in the second half of since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which carry different gross profit margins  our future gross profit margins will vary from quarter to quarter  and year to year based upon the mix of our contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects  and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service we perform 
even within category types  the amount of gross profit margins generated might vary due to the unique nature  and size of each contract and project we undertake 
this could impact our future gross profit margins and gross profit comparisons to historical levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses  or s  g a expenses  increased by approximately in over the increase in total s  g a expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of pharmanet  the expansion of our business  including additional administrative and other personnel costs  health and casualty insurance  depreciation expense  facility costs  and public company expenses including professional fees  insurance coverages and the costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act costs 
additionally in we incurred approximately million in severance charges and approximately million of additional legal fees and other costs associated with the events affecting our miami facility as described throughout this report 
our loss from foreign currency transactions decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in s  g a expenses as a percentage of direct revenue remained at in as compared to depreciation expense increased from approximately million in to million in or an increase of 
depreciation is included in both the direct costs and s  g a expense line items in our financial statements 
this increase is primarily attributable to inclusion of a full year of operations at pharmanet and to a lesser extent to the purchase of our miami facility which houses one of our early stage clinical operations and a clinical laboratory 
we previously leased this facility 
the increase is also attributable to significant new purchases of bioanalytical equipment consistent with the growth of bioanalytical revenue and leasehold improvements including the buildout of our new toronto  canada bioanalytical laboratory 
s  g a expenses include amortization which arose from the intangible assets we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
amortization expense increased from approximately million in to approximately million in or an increase of primarily as a result of the pharmanet acquisition 

table of contents we expect amortization expense to decrease to approximately million in as a result of the full amortization in of certain intangible assets at our miami facility 
interest income expense our interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense includes recurring non cash amortization and write off of deferred finance costs 
this increase is primarily attributable to a full year in of interest expense in on our million convertible notes issued in august  which bear interest at an annual interest rate of  and due to interest expense on our credit facility entered into in december during the period ended march   we incurred a non cash charge of approximately million related to the write off of deferred charges due to repayment of million on the term loan 
in june we incurred an additional non cash charge of million as a result of the amendment and repayment of approximately million on the term loan 
as of december  and march  the balance outstanding on our credit facility was million excluding accrued interest 
the current interest rate on this variable rate facility as of march  is approximately 
the remaining deferred financing costs of approximately million relating to convertible notes and the remaining credit facility will be amortized over a period of between five and six years and will be charged to interest expense 
in order to save interest charges on funds we are not borrowing  we may decide to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity of our credit facility 
this would require us to write off additional deferred financing charges 
the write off of deferred financing charges may exceed the non cash interest savings for the year in which we reduce the maximum borrowing capacity 
interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the decrease is primarily attributable to average reduced cash balances during the year as a result of loan repayments during interest expense on the loans significantly exceeded interest yields on available cash balances 
income tax expenses excluding the impact of the non cash goodwill write off of million  which did not generate a tax benefit  our effective tax rate for was compared to for this decrease was primarily attributable to a greater percentage of earnings generated from our foreign operations relative to our consolidated earnings 
the effective tax rate from our united states operations is substantially greater than our effective tax rate in canada where anapharm operates and several key european countries where pharmanet operates 
as described elsewhere in this report  anapharm receives significant tax credits from the government of canada relating to its research and development expenses 
these credits lower our effective tax rate in canada and in other countries where we operate 
we expect the nature of anapharm s business and the generation of significant tax credits to continue  however  there can be no assurance as to the future amount of these credits on a quarterly or annual basis due to the mix of contracts and the related amounts of research and development activity 
pharmanet generates approximately of its net earnings from foreign operations 
pharmanet s non u 
s and non canadian operations are based in zumikon zurich switzerland where the effective tax rate of approximately is lower than the united states 
the swiss office subcontracts all work to the non us and non canadian pharmanet offices  and reimburses these offices for their operating costs  plus provides a markup depending on transfer pricing analysis on those operating costs 
the residual income in these non us and non canadian offices are taxed at their statutory rate which is generally to 
our future effective tax rate will also be dependent on a number of factors  including the relative profits generated primarily in the united states  canada and europe  our ability to utilize canadian tax credits  
table of contents the applicable foreign tax rates then in effect  and transfer pricing 
we expect our effective tax rate in to increase as a result of i less interest expense including the elimination of one time charges related to the pre payment of our credit facility  and ii the elimination of severance costs thus contributing to increased earnings for us operations 
earnings per share net earnings decreased from approximately million in to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the following information with respect to our earnings per share and the number of shares outstanding gives effect to our may for stock split 
on a fully diluted basis  our earnings per share decreased from in to for the year ended december  the principal reason for the decrease in net earnings was the one time goodwill impairment charge of million related to our miami facility 
additionally  we incurred approximately million in severance costs associated with the december  resignations of our former chief executive officer and former president and chairman 
these factors offset the strong earnings contributions from anapharm and pharmanet 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a diluted basis increased from  for the year ended december  to  shares for the year ended december  the increase in the number of fully diluted shares resulted primarily from inclusion of the  shares issued by sfbc in a public offering in march  offset by the repurchase of  shares in november and december we have issued  including  issued to an executive on march  shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units at the election of each grantee in to two executive officers  senior executives and two independent directors 
additionally we will issue restricted stock or restricted stock units at the election of each grantee to our independent directors upon their election this summer and expect to issue shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to our new chief executive officer in connection with his new employment agreement 
the restricted stock or the restricted stock units to be issued to our independent directors vest over time  and the equity grants to our new chief executive officer are currently being negotiated 
we may also be required to issue  of restricted stock as additional consideration relating to the clinical pharmacology associates acquisition 
further  if the average stock price of our common stock during a reporting period is greater than  then shares reserved for issuance on possible conversion of our convertible senior notes will be included in calculating diluted shares outstanding in an amount equal to the difference between the conversion amount and the outstanding principal amount divided by 
the conversion amount will  for this purpose  be the principal amount divided by multiplied by the average stock price during the period 
our balance sheet contains an item entitled accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
this has no impact on our statement of earnings and reflects the strengthening primarily of the canadian dollar and euro relative to the united states dollar and is calculated on december st 
in the future  other comprehensive earnings may increase or decrease depending upon the movement of various foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar and based upon the level of inter company activity outside of the united states

direct revenue our direct revenue was approximately million for the year ended december   which is an increase of approximately from approximately million for the prior year 
our increase stems from both internal growth and our acquisitions 
the primary components of this increase are an increase in anapharm s consolidated revenue from million to approximately million  a significant increase in our united states phase i and phase ii revenue  a full year of operations from clinical pharmacology  our acquisition of taylor technology  inc  and a full year of operations from sfbc anapharm europe 
our direct revenue increased primarily as the result of performing or managing more clinical trials and testing more samples  increases in the size of clinical trials and price increases 
our early stage clinical trial business benefited both from strong internal growth and from a full year of operations from clinical pharmacology 
another important contributor of our growth and net revenue was the increased size and effectiveness of our business development group or sales force 
in  we saw an increasing number of new clients in our early stage clinical trials business in the united states and canada 
finally  the improvement in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar contributed to our increased revenue  although as discussed below  the strengthening of the canadian dollar had a negative impact on our results of operations in direct costs direct costs as a percentage of direct revenue decreased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
consistent with the growth in our revenue in  our direct costs increased but to a lesser amount on a percentage basis 
the principal factors were increased personnel expenses  recruiting expenses  subject related payments and expenses  and reimbursable out of pocket expenses related to our late stage business as sfbc new drug services  inc 
table of contents gross profit margins our gross profit margin was in compared to in our gross margins increased in due to decreased direct costs as a percentage of direct revenue 
in  we were able to generate increased revenue at substantially all of our locations without a proportionate increase in direct costs 
this is primarily attributable to obtaining more efficiency from our workforce which is relatively fixed in nature and does not vary directly with increased revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses  or s  g a expenses  increased by in over the increase in total s  g a expenses is primarily due to the expansion of our business  including additional administrative and other personnel costs  health and casualty insurance  depreciation expense  facility costs  public company expenses including professional fees and the costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act of additionally  our loss from foreign currency transactions increased to approximately million in from approximately million in depreciation expense increased from approximately  in to  in or an increase of 
depreciation is included in both the direct costs and s  g a expense line items in our financial statements 
this increase is primarily attributable to the purchase of our miami facility which houses our principal phase i clinical operation  our primary clinical laboratory and our corporate headquarters 
we previously leased this facility 
the increase is also attributable to significant new purchases of bioanalytical equipment consistent with the growth of bioanalytical revenue and leasehold improvements including the buildout of our new toronto canada bioanalytical laboratory 
amortization expense increased from approximately  in to  in or an increase of 
amortization arises from the intangible assets we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the pharmanet acquisition were recorded at estimated fair values as determined by our management based on information currently available and on current assumptions as to future operations 
we have allocated the purchase price based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the acquired property  plant and equipment  and identified intangible assets  and their estimated remaining useful lives 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price and the assigned estimated useful lives are subject to revision  based on the final determination of appraised and other fair values  and related tax effects 
interest income expense our interest income materially increased in primarily as a result of our investment of the net proceeds from our august convertible note offering  in which we issued million of convertible notes  and increased cash flows from operations 
our interest expense increased substantially in primarily as the result of the interest on our convertible notes and the mortgage used to purchase our miami facility  and to a lesser extent increased lease equipment expenses in canada 
the convertible notes bear interest at an annual interest rate of which resulted in a total interest expense in of  in december  we entered into a million credit facility consisting of a term loan and revolving line of credit 
at december   the balance due under this credit facility was million 
income tax expenses our effective tax rate for was compared to for this increase was primarily attributable to a greater percentage of earnings generated from our united states operations relative to our consolidated earnings 
the effective tax rate from our united states operations is substantially greater than our effective tax rate in canada 
as described elsewhere in this report  anapharm receives significant tax credits from the government of canada relating to its research and development expenses 
these credits lower our effective tax rate in canada 
nevertheless  our effective tax rate from canadian operations increased in because a greater amount of our canadian earnings were generated from operations which did not qualify for these tax credits 
this also contributed to the increase in our overall effective tax rate 

table of contents earnings per share net earnings increased from approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  an increase of 
the following information with respect to our earnings per share and the number of shares outstanding gives effect to our may for stock split 
on a fully diluted basis  our earnings per share increased from to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the  an increase of 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the principal reasons for the increase in net earnings were the contributions from our canadian operations  principally at anapharm  contributions from our miami facility  which included months of earnings from clinical pharmacology  and the significant earnings from taylor technology  which we acquired in july the increase in the number of fully diluted shares resulted primarily from inclusion for a full year of the  shares issued by sfbc in a public offering in november  the issuance of approximately  shares in connection with the taylor technology acquisition in july  the issuance of approximately  shares in connection with the pharmanet acquisition in december  the increased dilutive effect of stock options due to the increase in our common stock price and the exercise of approximately  options during the year 
additionally  the number of fully diluted shares outstanding at december  included only part of the shares we issued to acquire clinical pharmacology in because we purchased this business in august our balance sheet contains an item entitled accumulated other comprehensive earnings 
this has no impact on our statement of earnings and reflects the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar and is calculated on december st 
in the future  other comprehensive earnings may increase or decrease depending upon the movement of various foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar and based upon the level of inter company activity outside of the united states 
effects of inflation our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in contrast to approximately million of net cash provided by operations in the change is primarily due to the substantial increase in net earnings before depreciation and amortization and client advances  offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable  arising from the growth of our business in for  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million compared to approximately million used in investing activities in the principal reasons for this decrease in resulted from uses of approximately million of cash used to fund our acquisitions of pharmanet and taylor technology  and our purchase of approximately million of marketable securities in in  we paid approximately million in additional purchase consideration to the former shareholders of pharmanet  clinical pharmacology associates and new drug services  additionally  we incurred million in capital expenditures comprised primarily of equipment  computer software  land in quebec city  canada in december and leasehold improvements consistent with the growth of our business 
during  net cash of approximately million was used in financing activities compared to net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the receipt in of net proceeds of approximately million after expenses from an offering of convertible notes in august september  our borrowing of million under the term loan and million under the revolving line of credit of our credit facility a substantial portion of which was used to finance the acquisition of pharmanet 
this is offset by approximately million used to repurchase our common stock 
in we generated approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering 
table of contents of common stock and repaid approximately million of our credit facility 
additionally in  we repurchased approximately million in treasury stock which was recently retired 
on december   sfbc entered into a million credit facility from a syndicate of banks arranged by ubs securities llc 
the facility consisted of a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving line of credit in the maximum amount of million 
borrowings under the credit facility provided a portion of the consideration used to acquire of the stock of pharmanet 
as a result of sfbc s march  public offering  we prepaid million toward the term loan on march   reducing the outstanding balance to million 
as a result of this prepayment sfbc incurred a non cash write off of deferred loan costs of approximately million 
on june   sfbc entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement  or the amendment 
as a result of this amendment  we eliminated the term loan portion of the facility and increased the amount of the revolving line of credit facility from million to million 
also  as a result of paying off the term loan  sfbc incurred an additional non cash write off of approximately million of deferred loan costs 
the amendment also gave sfbc the ability to expand the amended credit facility through the addition of an unfunded million accordion feature 
prior to the amendment the credit facility bore interest at the rate of basis points above libor for the term loan and basis points above libor for the revolving credit facility 
we were also required to make quarterly principal payments and  beginning january   sweep of our excess cash flow  as defined  to reduce the principal balance of the term loan 
under the new credit facility  the interest rate was reduced from to basis points above libor  no principal payments are required until maturity on december  and the excess cash flow sweep requirement was effectively eliminated 
the interest rate was scheduled to drop to basis points above libor effective january   however  due to the defaults which were waived  the interest rate remained at basis points above libor pending renegotiation of the credit facility 
prior to the amendment  we had approximately million due under the term loan and million due under the revolving line of credit 
we used approximately million of our existing cash  not including payment of accrued interest and closing costs  and borrowed million under the revolving line of credit to repay the term loan 
as of the close of business on december   and march   our outstanding balance under the credit facility was approximately million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our united states assets and is due in december under the terms of the credit facility  sfbc must comply with certain restrictive covenants requiring it to maintain certain leverage  interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and limiting its annual capital expenditures 
also  the credit facility contains certain covenants that restrict  or may have the effect of restricting  sfbc s payment of dividends 
during  we expect to incur materially lower interest expense as a result of significantly lower outstanding loan balances 
in order to save interest charges on funds we are not borrowing  we may decide to reduce the maximum borrowing capacity of our credit facility 
this would require us to write off additional deferred financing charges 
the write off of deferred financing charges may exceed the non cash interest savings for the year in which we reduce the maximum borrowing capacity 
we recently received a waiver relating to violations of our credit facility 
the violations occurred primarily as a result of the million impairment discussed above and the december  severance agreements with our former senior management 
we cannot currently borrow under the credit facility 
we are negotiating with our lenders another amendment to the credit facility but there can be no assurances we will be successful 
without a further amendment  we are in violation of the covenants contained in our credit facility as of march  this is because certain covenants use our results of operations over a trailing months period 
thus  the december  impairment charge and severance costs cause us to violate these covenants at march  additionally  in august and september we issued million of convertible notes due the notes are redeemable at any time or after august   subject to prior conversion once we give notice of redemption 
additionally  holders of notes may require us to repurchase the notes on august  
table of contents  and upon any redemption we will be required to pay principal and accrued interest 
also  the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at any time 
the initial conversion price is approximately per share 
if the holder elects to convert  we will be required to pay the conversion value of the underlying shares with up to the principal and accrued interest in cash and the premium  if any  in shares of our common stock 
there is no assurance that we will have sufficient cash to pay the cash amount due upon conversion by the holders of a significant amount of notes who choose to convert their notes during a relatively short time frame 
at march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
based upon our cash balances  our cash flows from operations and the anticipated amendment of the credit facility which will enable us to borrow funds if necessary  we believe we have adequate working capital to meet our operational needs for the next months 
we expect to start construction of our new anapharm headquarters facility in quebec city  canada imminently 
our plan is to engage in a sale leaseback transactions where we find an investor to purchase the land from us and complete construction  which we anticipate will be completed by the second quarter of while we believe that we will be able to consummate this transaction  and are currently engaged in meaningful discussions  we cannot assure you we will be successful 
if we do not complete the sale leaseback transaction  we will incur additional capital expenditures which may exceed the allowable limits in our credit facility and may require us to pay off the credit facility 
this could result in material adverse consequences and affect our future liquidity 
additionally  our leases in quebec city expire in june and august if we encounter construction delays which extend beyond expiration of our leases  our future results of operations in may be materially and adversely affected 
previously  a significant component of our business strategy was to seek to make acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and meet certain operational requirements 
given current conditions relating to our miami subsidiary  we have less of a focus on making further acquisitions 
however  our management continues to assess acquisition opportunities 
if we consummate any acquisitions  we expect to use our existing cash  our credit facility and  if necessary  obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund any such acquisitions 
except for stock issued in connection with the clinical pharmacology associates earn out described below  restricted stock issued in lieu of options  stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan or the possibility of issuing stock in connection with an accretive acquisitions and the commitments noted below  we do not currently anticipate issuing any of our common stock during in july  we paid million in additional merger consideration to former pharmanet stockholders pursuant to our merger agreement with pharmanet 
the merger agreement provided that additional merger consideration was payable if working capital at the closing date  as determined  exceeded an agreed upon amount 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement with sfbc  taylor technology shareholders were required to deliver million in working capital  as defined  to sfbc 
this amount was subject to a one year measurement period subsequent to the july closing  to record adjustments  if any  to amounts delivered to sfbc in july on august  sfbc paid taylor technology shareholders approximately  for delivering to sfbc working capital in excess of the million level 
when we purchased the stock of clinical pharmacology associates in august  we agreed to pay its former shareholders up to million in additional purchase consideration based upon the revenue of our miami clinical trials facility into which clinical pharmacology was integrated 
a total of million was paid to them in each of august and  one half in cash and one half in our common stock 
we may be obligated to pay the former shareholders of clinical pharmacology associates an additional million in additional earn out in equal amounts of cash and common stock for the month period ending june   if certain future operating milestones are achieved 
based upon the revenue generated from our miami facility during the current month period ending june   it is likely that we will be required to pay the former clinical pharmacology associates shareholders the remaining million of earn out  one half in cash and one half in common stock 
we anticipate spending million in capital asset expenditures for  consisting primarily of new equipment to create extra capacity and facilities  the anticipated remediation of the miami facility and for 
table of contents future growth including our new toronto clinical trials facility 
this level of capital expenditures assumes  as discussed in this report  that we will be successful in entering into a sale leaseback transaction relating to our new quebec city facility 
additionally  the million includes an estimate of million to remediate the miami property 
in the event we are unsuccessful in entering into a sale leaseback transaction  or our costs remediating the miami facility exceed million  our capital expenditures could exceed million for because we are uncertain as to whether we will appeal our building department classification or if we do appeal  whether we will be successful  we are uncertain as to whether we must meet enhanced fire safety standards 
therefore  we cannot presently determine the additional costs we will incur 
under our current credit facility  we can spend million in for capital expenditures 
as stated elsewhere in this report  we cannot borrow on the line of credit unless we are successful in amending the credit facility 
in such event  we would be required to pay off the credit facility 
contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year years years years credit facility and line of credit obligations convertible notes interest on convertible notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the million is presently due in it is listed as due in less than one year solely because of the credit facility violations at december   which were subsequently waived 
currently anapharm is contractually committed to build a  square foot building estimated to cost approximately  anapharm has indicated to the builder that it wishes to expand the size of the building to approximately  square feet 
the extra  square feet is anticipated to cost an additional amount of approximately  anapharm has indicated to third parties that it is interested in entered into a sale leaseback transaction including the sale of the underlying land it purchased for million in december anapharm will not enter into a contractual agreement to build the extra  square foot unless it can be assured of entering into a sale leaseback arrangement 
consequently  the  has been excluded from the contractual obligation table

under our agreement with our joint venture partner in spain  we are required to fund the working capital of sfbc anapharm europe 
because that operations provides significant cash flow from operations  we have not had to provide it any working capital nor do we expect to be required to do so in the immediate future 
when we purchased sfbc new drug services  inc in  we agreed to pay the seller additional purchase consideration based upon sfbc new drug services future operating results over a three year period commencing september  although sfbc new drug services was profitable  except for  in guaranteed payments  we have not paid any additional purchase consideration

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement r which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions for example  stock options and awards of restricted stock in which an employer receives employee services in exchange for equity securities of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity securities

cost is determined on the actual purchase price of the marketable security for determining realized gains and losses 
as of december   there were no material realized gains or losses

currency risk for the year ended december  our foreign revenue accounted for of the total revenue
