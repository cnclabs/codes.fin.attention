item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
amounts in this section have been rounded to the nearest thousand  except percentages  ratios  per share data  numbers of franchise locations and numbers of businesses 
unless otherwise indicated  or unless the context otherwise requires  references to years in this section mean our fiscal years ended december general our primary business activity is insurance sales through franchisees and most of our revenues are generated from commissions paid on the sale of insurance 
commission revenues typically represent a percentage of insurance premiums paid by policyholders 
premium amounts and commission percentage rates are established by insurance companies  so we have little or no control of the commission amount generated from the sale of a specific insurance policy 
our business also includes lending to businesses that sell insurance and related services 
unlike commission revenues  lending interest rates are typically set by us  although competitive forces are important limiting factors when establishing rates 
brooke franchise most of our revenues are from commissions paid to brooke franchise  our wholly owned franchise subsidiary  by insurance companies for the sale of insurance policies on a retail basis through exclusive franchisees 
brooke franchise primarily relies on the recruitment of additional franchisees to increase retail insurance commission revenues 
brooke franchise s franchisees typically specialize in general insurance sales  auto insurance sales and business insurance sales 
brooke franchise also consults with business sellers and lenders 
brooke credit our wholly owned finance subsidiary generates most of its revenues from interest income resulting from loans held on our balance sheet in the form of inventory loans held for sale and from gains on sale of loans when they are removed from our balance sheet 
most of brooke credit s loans are made to brooke franchise s franchisees  although an increasing share of loans have been made to insurance related businesses that are not franchisees 
brooke credit funds its loan portfolio primarily through the sale of loan participation interests to other lenders  commercial bank loans secured by loan assets and the sale of securities  backed by loan assets  to accredited investors 

table of contents brooke brokerage our wholly owned insurance and loan brokerage subsidiary generates revenues from commissions paid by insurance companies for the sale of hard to place and niche insurance policies on a wholesale basis through non exclusive agents and our own franchise agents 
brooke brokerage primarily relies on the recruitment of additional broker agents to increase wholesale commission revenues 
brooke brokerage corporation also uses its industry contacts and expertise in insurance brokerage to broker loans for  and consult with  general insurance agencies specializing in hard to place insurance sales  captive insurance agencies specializing in captive insurance sales and funeral homes selling final expense insurance 
results of operations our consolidated results of operations have been significantly impacted by our expansion of territory and personnel in recent years

table of contents and the and increases in interest income net  primarily resulted from increased loan origination activities  increases in the amount of loans held in inventory for eventual sale and increases in retained interest from loans sold 
expenses are also expected to continue to increase as a result of opening new franchise locations in the increase of commission expense in is primarily attributable to increases in insurance commissions received from insurance companies  because a share of insurance commissions is typically paid to franchisees 
payroll expenses  which include wages  salaries  payroll taxes and compensated absences expenses  and other operating expenses  which include advertising  rent  travel  lodging  office supplies and insurance expenses  increased primarily as a result of the expansion of our franchise operations  securitization related expenses  the opening of additional service sales centers and the acquisition of texas all risk general agency in payroll expenses  as a percentage of total operating revenue  were approximately in  in  and in other operating expenses  as a percentage of total operating revenue  were approximately in  in  and in amortization expense increased in primarily as a result of amortization of the servicing asset  which increased significantly as a result of brooke credit s participation loan sales activities 
depreciation increased in primarily as a result of the renovation of our national office facility in overland park  kansas in the third quarter of the increase in other operating interest expenses in and is primarily attributable to interest paid on a bank line of credit 
we typically use these lines of credit to fund our loans until we sell them through a securitization 
we consider bond and debenture interest expense to be an operating expense because the proceeds from the sale of such bonds and debentures were used to partially fund our lending activities 
we consider interest expense  other than line of credit  bond and debenture interest expense  to be a non operating expense 
interest expense increased significantly in and as a result of increased debt to commercial banks  which was incurred primarily to capitalize our operating subsidiaries  and increased notes payable balances resulting from deferred payments to sellers of businesses acquired by us 
income before income taxes for increased at a faster rate than net income because we increased our income tax liability to reflect an increase in the estimated effective tax rate from to 
the increase in the estimated effective tax rate resulted from a preliminary estimate of taxes and the actual tax rate 
net income and net income per share have increased year over year primarily because we have increased the number of new franchises each year 
a significant share of our revenues results from initial franchise fees associated with adding new franchise locations 
a significant share of our revenues also results from gains recorded on the sale of loans made to new franchisees 
initial franchise fees and gains on sales of loans typically have larger profit margins than those generated by our other activities 

table of contents assets are expected to continue to increase in as a result of continued expansion and holding more loans prior to the sale of participation interests in such loans or securitizing such loans in order to increase interest income

customer receivables increased in and primarily from continued expansion of our franchise operations 
a loss allowance was established for brooke franchise s credit loss exposure to customer receivables see franchise services segment  below 
notes receivables include loans made by brooke credit to franchisees and others 
notes receivables balances vary  sometimes significantly from year to year  as a result of our decision to temporarily retain more or fewer loans in our held for sale loan inventory based on the funds available to us 
during  brooke credit used its line of credit to increase its notes receivables balances 
no loss allowance has been made for the notes receivables held in brooke credit s loan inventory because we typically hold these assets for less than one year and  therefore  have a short term exposure to loss  and we have experienced limited credit losses see lending services segment  below 
interest earned not collected on notes accrued interest income increased in and primarily because we are holding more loans 
customer receivables  notes receivables and interest earned not collected on notes are the three items above that comprise our accounts and notes receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet 
other receivables  which primarily include the estimated amounts due from franchisees for future policy cancellations  fluctuate from year to year as the result of changes in policy cancellation rate calculations 
the terms of our securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
we retain ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool  and the corresponding securities asset increased in and as the result of our securitization activity 
deferred charges increased in primarily as a result of origination fees and other such expenses associated with acquiring a bank line of credit 
accounts payable  which includes franchise payables  producer payables  payroll payables and other accrued expenses  increased in primarily from the continued expansion of our franchise operations  which increased the accrual for estimated commission expense due franchisees 

table of contents payable under participation agreements is the amount we owe to funding institutions which have purchased a participating interest in loans pursuant to transactions that do not meet the true sale test of sfas accounting for transfers and services of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
payable under participation agreements increased in and because we sold more loans pursuant to transactions that did not meet the true sale test 
the premiums payable liability category is comprised primarily of amounts due to insurance companies for premiums that are billed and collected by our franchisees 
premiums payable decreased in and primarily as a result of an increased emphasis on direct insurance company billing of policies 
debt decreased in primarily as the result of a securitization of notes receivable in december and a corresponding decrease in notes receivable balances 
debt increased in primarily to fund increases in our notes receivables and securities 
the following tables provide information regarding our notes receivables  notes participations  notes payables and bonds debentures payables principal balances and the corresponding weighted interest rates as of the end of each quarter in  and excluding capitalized lease balances 
notes receivables balances include the loans originated by brooke credit to our franchisees and others  even though the notes may no longer be on our balance sheet 
notes participations are comprised of loan participation interests that we have sold to our funding institutions and securitization entities that we typically no longer carry on our balance sheet 
notes payables balances are comprised of borrowings to fund the loans that we have made to our franchisees and others and include primarily notes issued to sellers of agencies we have purchased  borrowings under our lines of credit and bank borrowings

table of contents bonds debentures payables in thousands principal weighted rate principal weighted rate principal weighted rate st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter key measurements used by management at present  our profitability is dependent in part on our ability to continue adding locations to our franchise network 
as we grow  we believe that our profitability will become less dependent on the opening of new franchise locations and more dependent on the operation of existing franchise locations 
we measure our progress in becoming less dependent upon the opening of these new locations by monitoring the following the ratio of revenues from our existing business to expenses from our existing business  and  revenues from franchise network expansion 
the ratio of revenues from our existing business to expenses from our existing business helps us identify operating losses we currently would experience in the event that franchise locations are not added and the associated initial franchise fees are not recorded 
we define revenues from our existing business as net franchise commissions  net interest income  net brokerage commissions and net brokerage underwriting profits 
these are the revenues that come from our existing franchise locations  our existing loans outstanding and our existing wholesale brokerage operations and are not dependent on the addition of new franchise locations 
we exclude initial franchise fees  seller consulting fees  gains on sales of businesses and gain on loan sales 
revenues from our existing business are generally considered by us to be those revenues that are reasonably likely to be recorded in the next year regardless of whether new franchise locations are added 
we define expenses from our existing business as the expenses that we believe we will continue to incur  even if we do not expand our franchise network 
expenses from our existing business include payroll  other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization and are reasonably likely to be incurred in the next year regardless of whether new franchise locations are added 
a ratio of would indicate that our existing business produces sufficient revenues to cover the expenses incurred in connection with our existing operations 
part of our operating strategy is to ultimately increase this ratio to 
monitoring our revenues from franchise network expansion is also important to us because our profitability currently is largely determined by our ability to add new franchise locations and to earn the associated initial franchise fees 
revenues from franchise network expansion are defined as initial franchise fees  seller consulting fees  gains on sales of businesses and gains on loan sales 
a leveling or declining amount of revenues from franchise network expansion could indicate that our overall profitability is leveling or declining 
income taxes for the years ended december   and  we incurred income tax expenses of   and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of  and 
as of december  and  we had current income tax liabilities of  and  respectively  and deferred income tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
in we revised the manner in which we calculate taxes and deferred recognition of revenues  for tax purposes  on loans sold until interest payments are actually received 
as a result  a significant deferred tax liability was recorded 
analysis by segment our three reportable segments are franchise services  lending services and brokerage services 
the franchise services segment includes the sale of general insurance and related services to customers on a retail 
table of contents basis through franchisees by brooke franchise 
the lending services segment includes our lending activities through brooke credit 
the brokerage segment includes the sale of hard to place and niche insurance and the brokering of loans to other agencies that sell these kinds of insurance 
each segment is assessed a shared services expense  which is an internal allocation of legal  accounting  information technology and facilities management expenses based on our estimate of usage 
separate audited financial statements are prepared for each segment 
segment income and expenses exclude consolidating entries and segment assets and liabilities include consolidating entries  except total assets listed in tables 

table of contents franchise services segment financial information financial information for the years ended december   and  and the percentage change between periods  relating to brooke franchise and our franchise services segment is as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  operating revenues insurance commissions seller consulting fees gain on sale of businesses initial franchise fees for basic services initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans interest income  net other income total operating revenues operating expenses commission expense payroll expense amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes total assets at period end commission revenues retail insurance commissions have increased primarily as a result of brooke franchise s continued expansion of franchise operations 
brooke franchise also received commissions from the sale of investment securities and revenues from the sale of funeral services that are not directly related to insurance sales 
however  these revenues are not sufficient to be considered material and are  therefore  combined with insurance commission revenues 
commission expense increased because insurance commission income increased and franchisees are typically paid a share of insurance commission income 
commission expense represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke franchise s insurance commission revenue for the years ended december   and brooke franchise sometimes retains an additional share of franchisees commissions as payment for franchisee optional use of brooke franchise s service or sales centers 
however  all such payments are applied to service center sales center expenses and not applied to commission expense 
as of december   brooke franchise had a total of service centers sales centers  of which were opened in and in amortization expenses decreased in as the result of an internal audit of the amortization calculations on intangible assets performed during the second quarter of the net book values of the intangible assets were adjusted accordingly 
profit sharing commissions  or brooke franchise s share of insurance company profits paid by insurance companies on policies written by franchisees  increased  or  to  in and 
table of contents  or  to  in profit sharing commissions increased primarily because overall insurance company profits increased on policies written by brooke franchise s franchisees 
profit sharing commissions represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke franchise s insurance commissions for the years ended december   and franchisees do not receive any share of brooke franchises profit sharing commissions 
net commission refund expense is our estimate of the amount of brooke franchise s share of retail commission refunds due to policyholders resulting from future policy cancellations 
this expense increased  to  in and increased  to  in primarily as a result of brooke franchise s continued expansion of franchise operations 
as of december  and  brooke franchise recorded corresponding total commission refund liabilities of  and  respectively 
initial franchise fees for basic services a certain level of basic services is initially provided to all franchisees  whether they acquire an existing business and convert into a brooke franchise or whether they start up a new brooke franchise 
these basic services include services usually provided by other franchisors  including a business model  use of a registered trade name  access to suppliers and license for an internet based management system 
the amount of the initial franchise fees typically paid for basic services is currently  we expect the initial franchise fee rate for basic services to increase as demand for access to our trade name  suppliers and business model increases 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our franchises were typically conversions of acquired businesses and the initial franchise fee for basic services was typically waived because we believed that our franchise operations and trade name were not sufficiently established for franchisees to pay initial franchise fees for our basic services 
prior to the fourth quarter of  our initial franchise fees were attributed to inspection reports and other specific buyers assistance services 
however  as our franchise network has grown  our basic franchise services have become more valuable to our franchisees and we have been able to charge for these services 
the value of our basic franchise services was demonstrated when we began selling startup  or de novo  franchises in the fourth quarter of these franchisees did not require any specific buyers assistance services  but did require basic franchise services such as use of a registered trade name  supplier access and a proven business model 
therefore  when we introduced our startup franchise program in the fourth quarter of  we began allocating a portion of the initial franchise fees paid by conversion franchisees to basic services because startup franchisees willingly paid us initial franchise fees for basic services 
correspondingly  the amount of this allocation was based on the amount of initial franchise fees typically paid by a startup franchisee 
revenues from initial franchise fees for basic services are recognized as soon as brooke franchise delivers the basic services to the new franchisee  such as access to insurance company contracts and access to the company s brand name 
upon completion of this commitment  brooke franchise has no continuing obligation to the franchisee 
prior to  initial franchise fees for basic services were typically assessed once for each franchisee  even though some franchisees operated multiple locations 
beginning in  an initial franchise fee for basic services will be assessed for each location 
a total of  and new franchise locations were added in  and  respectively 
out of these total franchise locations    and were startup franchise locations added in  and  respectively 
in  our strategy is to continue to decrease our dependence on acquiring and converting new franchise locations into our system  and to increase the number of startup locations relative to the number of new conversion franchise locations 
therefore  we expect initial franchise fees for basic services to increase at a faster rate than initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plan services 

table of contents initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans the amount of the total initial franchise fees for all initial services typically varies based on the level of additional assistance provided by brooke franchise  which is largely determined by the size of the acquisition 
we typically base our initial franchise fees for buyer assistance plans on the estimated revenues of the acquired business 
all initial franchise fees are paid to brooke franchise when an acquisition closes 
we allocate initial franchise fees collected in excess of the initial franchise fee for basic service to initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans 
a significant part of brooke franchise s commission growth has come from acquisitions of existing businesses that are subsequently converted into brooke franchises 
brooke franchise provides assistance regarding the acquisition and conversion of businesses such as inspection report compilation  operations analysis and marketing plan development 
the increase of initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plan services resulted from continued expansion of brooke franchise s franchise operations and the corresponding increase in business acquisitions and franchise conversions by brooke franchisees 
the buyers assistance plan is designed to assist a franchisee in inspecting the agency assets to be acquired 
the buyers assistance plan bap includes an inspection report  an operations report  and a marketing report  all of which are to be delivered on or prior to closing 
as such brooke franchise performs substantially all of the bap services before an acquisition closes 
however  a relatively small level of bap services are performed during the four months after acquisition  including advertising and training assistance 
for this reason  a relatively small portion of the initial franchise fees for buyers assistance are correspondingly deferred until the service is performed 
brooke franchise records initial franchise fee revenues for buyers assistance plans using the percentage of completion accounting method 
to reflect revenues not yet earned  we deferred   and  of initial franchise fee revenues for buyers assistance plans as of december   and  respectively 
buyers assistance plans provide initial conversion assistance for recently acquired businesses and bap services are  therefore  generally not provided to buyers of businesses that are already franchises 
in addition  buyers assistance plans are not typically provided to franchisees selling to other franchisees and are not provided to franchisees purchasing businesses that had previously been purchased by brooke franchise in the past months 
a total of  and of the new franchise locations in  and  respectively  represent businesses that were converted into brooke franchises and received assistance through initial buyers assistance plans 
seller related revenues seller related revenues typically are generated when a business is acquired by brooke franchise for sale to a franchisee 
seller related revenues include consulting fees paid directly by sellers  gains on sale of businesses from deferred payments  gains on sale of businesses relating to company owned stores  and gains on sale of businesses relating to inventory 
a primary aspect of brooke franchise s business is the buying and selling of businesses 
therefore  all seller related revenues are considered part of normal business operations and are classified on our income statement as operating income 
seller related revenues decreased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in seller related revenues decreased in primarily because the gains recorded on the sale of company owned stores in was significantly more than the corresponding gains recorded in seller related revenues increased in primarily as the result of continued expansion of brooke franchise s franchise operations and the corresponding increase in business acquisitions and franchise conversions by brooke franchisees 
consulting fees 
brooke franchise helps sellers prepare their businesses for sale by developing business profiles  tabulating revenues  sharing its document library and general sale preparation 
the scope of the seller consulting engagement is largely determined by the size of the business being sold 
seller consulting fees are typically based on the transaction value  are contingent upon closing of the sales transaction  and are paid at closing 
brooke franchise completes its consulting obligation at closing and is not required to perform any additional tasks for the seller 
therefore  seller consulting fees paid directly by sellers are recognized at closing immediately because brooke franchise has no continuing obligation 
consulting fees increased from continued 
table of contents expansion of brooke franchise s franchise operations and the corresponding increase in business acquisitions and franchise conversions by brooke franchisees 
gains on sale of businesses from deferred payments 
our business includes the buying and selling of insurance agencies  financial service firms and funeral homes  and occasionally holding them in inventory 
when purchasing an agency  we typically defer a portion of the purchase price  at a low or zero interest rate  to encourage the seller to assist in the transition of the agency to one of our franchisees 
we carry our liability to the seller at a discount to the nominal amount we owe  to reflect the below market interest rate 
when we sell an acquired business to a franchisee typically on the same day it is acquired  we generally sell it for the full nominal price ie before the discount paid to the seller 
when the sale price of the business exceeds the carrying value  the amount in excess of the carrying value is recognized as a gain 
gains on sale resulting primarily from discounted interest rates increased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in because we expect to purchase and sell more agencies in than in  we expect the level of income recorded from this type of gain on sale of businesses to increase 
we regularly negotiate below market interest rates on the deferred portion of the purchase prices we pay sellers 
we consider these below market interest rates to be a regular source of income related to the buying and selling of businesses 
although we have a continuing obligation to pay the deferred portion of the purchase price when due  we are not obligated to prepay the deferred portion of the purchase price or to otherwise diminish the benefit of the below market interest rate upon which the reduced carrying value was based 
the calculation of the reduced carrying value  and the resulting gain on sale of businesses  is made by calculating the net present value of scheduled future payments to sellers at a current market interest rate 
the following table provides information regarding the corresponding calculations calculation of seller discounts based on reduced carrying values in thousands  except percentages and number of days beginning principal balance weighted average rate weighted average maturity interest rate used for net present value full nominal purchase price reduced carrying value gain on sale from deferred payments  days to    days to    days to   gains on sale of businesses company owned stores 
if we expect to own and operate businesses for more than one year  we consider these businesses to be company owned stores and treat such transactions under purchase accounting principles  including booking intangible assets and recognizing the related amortization expense 
by contrast  agencies purchased with the intent to resell them to our franchisees usually within one year are carried at cost as business inventory  without the booking of intangible assets 
gains on sale resulting from the sale of company owned stores was  in and  in the significant decrease in resulted from the sale of auto insurance agencies in that brooke franchise originally intended to operate as company owned stores 
gains on sale of businesses inventoried stores 
as noted above  acquired businesses are typically sold on the same day as acquired for the same nominal price paid to the seller 
however  this is not always the case and businesses are occasionally held in inventory 
as such  gains and losses are recorded when an inventoried business is ultimately sold and carrying values of inventoried businesses are adjusted to estimated market value when market value is less than cost 
as a result  gains on sale resulting from the sale of inventoried businesses resulted in a gain of  and  in and  respectively  and a loss of  in income before income taxes brooke franchise s income before income taxes decreased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in income decreased in 
table of contents primarily because initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans totaled  in the fourth quarter of which is a decrease of  from the  in initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans received in the fourth quarter of this decrease partially results from our strategy to decrease dependence on acquiring and converting new franchise locations into our system  and to increase the number of startup locations relative to the number of new conversion franchise locations 
income before taxes increased in because revenues grew faster than expenses  primarily as the result of significant increases in initial franchise fees and seller related revenues  which have relatively high profit margins 
company owned stores this discussion of company owned stores is separated into four store types inventoried stores  managed stores  pending stores  and developed stores 
inventoried stores include businesses purchased by brooke franchise for resale to franchisees 
managed stores include businesses as to which brooke franchise has entered into agreements with franchisees to manage stores as a result of lender collateral preservation  the disability of the franchisee  the death of the franchisee or other circumstances 
pending stores include businesses that franchisees have contracted to sell  but the transactions have not yet closed  and brooke franchise is managing the store to reduce the likelihood of asset deterioration prior to closing 
managed and pending stores are not recorded as an asset on brooke franchise s balance sheet 
however  because brooke franchise is entitled by agreement to the income and responsible for the expenses of the business until the agreement terminates or ownership is transferred  such income and expenses of managed and pending stores are recorded to brooke franchise s income statement and we  therefore  include the business in our discussions of company owned stores 
brooke franchise occasionally develops a business location that has not been previously owned by a franchisee 
because the store has been developed by brooke franchise instead of purchased from third parties  all income and expenses associated with development and operation are recorded as income and expenses  but an asset is not recorded on the balance sheet 
company owned stores revenues and expenses for years prior to are not available 
inventoried stores the number of total businesses purchased into inventory in  and was  and  respectively 
at december   and  brooke franchise held  and  respectively  businesses in inventory with respective total balances  at the lower of cost or market  of   and  revenues from the operation of inventoried stores for totaled  expenses incurred in the operation of inventoried stores for totaled  the number of businesses twice purchased into inventory within twenty four months is an important indicator of brooke franchise s success in recruiting qualified buyers 
the number of businesses twice purchased during  and was  and  respectively 
brooke franchise is not aware of any systemic adverse profitability or cash flow trends being experienced by buyers of businesses from its inventory 
managed stores at december   the total number of businesses managed under contract  but not owned  by brooke franchise was revenues from the operation of managed stores for totaled  operating expenses incurred by managed stores for totaled  additionally  owner s compensation expenses incurred by managed stores for totaled pending stores at december   the total number of businesses under contract for sale and managed by brooke franchise pending closing of a sale was revenues from the operation of pending stores for totaled  operating expenses incurred by pending stores for totaled  additionally  owner s compensation expenses incurred by pending stores for totaled  developed stores one business was owned and under development by brooke franchise at december  revenues and expenses from developed stores for were not sufficient to be considered material 
same store sales revenue generation  primarily commissions from insurance sales  is an important factor in franchise financial performance and revenue generation is carefully analyzed by brooke franchise 
analysis of same store sales is separated between converted stores and startup stores because existing businesses typically 
table of contents experience revenue decreases during the first months of conversion into a franchise  making reliable comparisons difficult 
twenty four months after initial conversion of an acquired business  brooke franchise considers the franchise seasoned and the comparison of current to prior year revenues is a more reliable indicator of franchise success 
because there is no conversion process for startup franchises  the associated revenues are included in same store sales calculations immediately after start up 
combined same store sales of seasoned converted franchises and startup franchises decreased in and increased and in and  respectively 
same store sales of seasoned franchises decreased in and increased and in and  respectively 
all same store sales calculations exclude profit sharing commissions 
brooke franchise believes that the decrease in overall franchise revenue growth rates primarily results from softer industry pricing and a decline of property and casualty insurance premiums causing a corresponding decline in commissions 
brooke franchise also believes that insurance premium rates  on a general basis  will not increase in franchise balances brooke franchise categorizes the balances owed by franchisees as either statement balances or non statement balances 
statement balances brooke franchise assists franchisees by financing cyclical fluctuations of revenues  receivables and payables with commission advances recorded on franchisees monthly statements and granting temporary extensions of due dates for franchise statement balances owed by franchisees to brooke franchise 
however  after initial conversion into its franchise system  brooke franchise expects franchisees monthly statements to be repaid in full at least once every four months 
we believe the most accurate analysis of franchise statement balances occurs immediately after settlement of franchisees monthly statements and before any additional entries are recorded to their account 
therefore  the following discussion of statement balances is as of the settlement date that follows the corresponding commission month 
franchise statement balances totaled  and  respectively  as of december and of these total franchise statement balances  brooke franchise identified statement balances totaling  and  respectively  which it categorizes as watch statement balances because the balances had not been repaid in full at least once in the previous four months 
non statement balances separate from these franchise statement balances  brooke franchise also extends credit to franchisees for long term producer development  including hiring and training new franchise employees  and for other reasons not related to monthly fluctuations of revenues 
these non statement balances are not reflected in the franchise statement balances referenced above and totaled  and  respectively  as of december and during  non statement balances increased at a faster rate than commissions primarily as a result of our strategy to increase the number of startup franchises and the increasing use of our producer development program by an increasing number of startup franchises 
brooke franchise s experience indicates that producer failure is usually identified within three months of initiating a producer development program and producer failure significantly increases the likelihood of credit losses 
therefore  to better monitor the quality of non statement balances  brooke franchise recently implemented a system that categorizes as watch balances all balances for producers who are in the first three months of development 
watch non statement balances totaled  and as of december and  respectively  and were calculated as of the settlement date that follows the corresponding commission month 
allowance for doubtful accounts the balance of brooke franchise s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively  on december  and the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined based primarily on analysis of brooke franchise s watch balances 
other factors used in determining the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts were write off experience and brooke franchise s evaluation of the potential for future losses 
total write offs increased primarily because write off of statement balances increased as the result of increasing franchising activity 
total write offs also increased because write off of non statement balances increased as the result of increasing producer development activity and from implementation of a system in the third quarter of to better monitor the quality of non statement balances

prior to either type of sale transaction  brooke credit typically holds these loans on its balance sheet and earns interest income from the loans 
once a sale is completed  we continue to earn interest income from any portion of the participation interest or asset backed security we retain  in which we typically record a gain on the sale of the loan 
we also continue to provide servicing for the loan  including loan accounting  receipt and distribution of interest payments and loan monitoring  and receive compensation for these activities 

table of contents interest income brooke credit earns interest income during the period it holds loans on its balance sheet and from retained interest resulting from loans sold as participation interests and asset backed securities 
interest income increased due to the larger volume of loans originated by brooke credit and the longer period of time that brooke credit held those loans on its balance sheet 
participating interest expense a portion of the interest income that brooke credit receives on its loans is paid out to the holders of its participation interest 
payments to these holders are accounted for as participating interest expense  which is netted against interest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
participating interest expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in participation interests that were sold by brooke credit 
participation interest expense represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke credit s interest income for the years ended december   and gain on sales of notes receivable when the sale of a loan is classified as a true sale pursuant to the criteria established by sfas accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  gains or losses are recognized  loans are removed from the balance sheet and residual assets are recorded 
we estimate the value of the residual assets by estimating the present value of the future cash flows from the interest and servicing spread  reduced by our estimate of credit losses and notes receivable prepayments 
the interest and servicing spread is the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and investors and the rate received by brooke credit from borrowers 
over time  as we receive cash from the payment of interest and servicing income  we reduce the value of the residual asset by writing down the interest asset and amortizing the servicing asset 
revenues from gain on sales of notes receivables increased in compared to primarily because brooke credit securitized more notes receivables in revenues from gain on sale of notes receivable decreased in compared to primarily because brooke credit securitized fewer notes receivables in fewer notes receivable were securitized in partially because brooke credit retained more notes receivables as secured borrowings 
when the sale is classified as a secured borrowing  no gain on sale is recognized  and the note receivable and the corresponding participation loan remain on the balance sheet 
one component of the gain on sales of notes receivable is the gain associated with our ongoing servicing responsibilities 
when the sale of a loan participation interest is accounted for as a true sale  brooke credit retains servicing responsibilities for which it typically receives annual servicing fees ranging from to of the outstanding balance 
a gain or loss is recognized immediately upon the sale of a loan participation based on whether the annual servicing fees are greater or less than the cost of servicing  which is estimated at of the outstanding loan balance 
the gain or loss associated with loan servicing is determined based on a present value calculation of future cash flows from servicing the underlying loans  net of prepayment assumptions 
during  and  the net gains losses from loan servicing totaled   and  respectively  which consisted of gains from servicing benefits of   and  respectively  and losses from servicing liabilities totaled   and  respectively 
the decrease in net gains from loan servicing benefits and servicing losses in is primarily the result of increased securitization activity and relatively fewer loan participation sales 
the increase in is primarily the result of relatively more loan participation sales and less securitization activity 
in a true sale  brooke credit also records a gain on sale for the interest benefit based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the interest and servicing spread on the underlying loans sold  net of prepayment and credit loss assumptions 
this spread is typically approximately for participation loans and approximately for securitized loan pools 
during  and  the net gains from interest benefits totaled   and  respectively  which included gross gains from interest benefits of    respectively  and losses from write downs of retained interest asset to fair market value of    respectively 
the increase in net gains from interest benefits 
table of contents in is primarily the result of securitizing more loans in and the decrease in is primarily the result of securitizing fewer loans in and greater reductions in net gain income from marking to fair market value the increasing retained interest asset balances 
gains losses from servicing and interest benefits are typically non cash gains losses as brooke credit receives cash equal to the carrying value of the loans sold 
a corresponding adjustment has been made on the statement of cash flows to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities 
gain on sale accounting requires us to make assumptions regarding prepayment speeds and credit losses for participated loans and asset backed securities 
the performances of these loans are extensively monitored  and adjustments to these assumptions will be made if necessary 
underlying assumptions used in the initial determination of future cash flows on the participation loans and asset backed securities accounted for as sales include the following agency loans adjustable rate stratum agency loans fixed rate stratum prepayment speed weighted average remaining term months months expected credit losses discount rate annual rates during the fourth quarter the discount rate assumption was changed from to 
several factors were considered when determining the discount rate 
as a starting point for analyzing this assumption  the risk free rate was used to determine a base discount rate 
this base discount rate was then adjusted for various risk characteristics associated with the sold loans 
the most significant impact from the sale of loan participations and asset backed securities has been the removal of loans from brooke credit s balance sheet that brooke credit continues to service 
as of december   december  and december   the balances of those off balance sheet assets totaled   and  respectively 
the increased level of off balance sheet assets is primarily the result of a larger loan portfolio and the resulting sale of loan participations and asset backed securities 
loan servicing assets and liabilities when we recognize non cash gains for the servicing benefits of loan participation sales  we book that amount as a loan servicing asset on our balance sheet 
this amount is equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from the servicing spread 
we recognize such assets only when the income allocated to our servicing responsibilities exceeds our cost of servicing  which we typically estimate at of the loan value being serviced 
components of the servicing asset as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees less servicing expense discount to present value carrying value of retained servicing interest in loan participations 
table of contents in connection with the recognition of non cash losses for the servicing liabilities of loan participation sales  the present value of future cash flows were recorded as servicing liabilities 
components of the servicing liability as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees less servicing expense discount to present value carrying value of retained servicing liability in loan participations loan participations interest receivable asset to the extent that the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and investors and the rate received by brooke credit from borrowers exceeds the maximum of allocated to the servicing benefit  brooke credit recognizes a non cash asset  called an interest receivable asset  on its balance sheet 
this amount is equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from this interest spread 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in loan participations estimated credit losses from liability on sold recourse loans with balances totaling  as of december  credit loss estimates are based upon experience  delinquency rates  collateral adequacy  market conditions and other pertinent factors 
securitization interest receivable asset the terms of brooke credit s securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
brooke credit retains ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool and borrows money from commercial banks to fund this investment 
additionally  brooke credit recognizes a non cash gain from subordinate interests in the securitized loan pools which are not sold to outside investors and are retained by us 
brooke credit  therefore  retains a credit exposure in each loan pool 
brooke credit corporation s subordinate interest and retained interest benefit results in a non cash asset  which is included within securities on our balance sheet 
as of december    of the securities resulted from retained interest in securitizations 
the fair value of these securities is comprised of the subordinate or equity interest in the securitized loan pools totaling  and the interest only strip receivable asset  evidencing retained interest benefits  totaling  as of december   brooke credit had borrowed  from commercial banks  the proceeds of which were used to fund its equity interest in the securitized loan pools 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in asset backed securities 
table of contents other operating interest expense the increase in other operating interest expenses in and is primarily attributable to interest paid on bank lines of credit 
brooke credit uses these lines of credit to fund its loans until we sell them in a securitization 
other operating expenses the increase in other operating expenses is primarily attributable to securitization related fees of  in and  in the increase in securitization related fees is directly related to the increase in loan securitization activity and the corresponding increase in gain on sale of notes receivable 
securitization related fees include legal fees  advisor fees  accounting fees  program fees  origination fees and other fees related to securitizations and the corresponding line of credit 
these fees include the legal fees paid through a shared services agreement with the parent company 
income before income taxes brooke credit s income before income taxes increased significantly in primarily because net interest income revenues increased  from more loan originations and gain on sale of notes receivables income increased  after deduction of an increase in securitization related expenses of  from more loan securitizations 
loan quality no amounts of recourse loans and loans associated with securitizations were charged off for the year ended december  and none of these loans were delinquent days or more as of december   primarily because loan payments generally are deducted from commissions received by brooke franchise prior to payment of commissions to the borrower and most other creditors 
we believe that credit problems on recourse and securitized loans are more likely to be identified when brooke franchise collects franchisees monthly statement account balances than by monitoring brooke credit s loan delinquencies 
the terms of brooke credit s securitizations and a collateral preservation measure require that payments on the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors be paid from commissions received by brooke franchise prior to payment of commissions to the borrower and to most other creditors 
as a result  we believe that our primary credit exposure generally results from brooke franchise s collection of monthly franchisees statement balances rather than from loan defaults to brooke credit 
although we believe that credit loss exposure is limited on securitized loans and loan participations sold with recourse  brooke credit has reduced its expected retained interest associated with these loans by approximately  for credit loss allowance as of december   which reduced the amount of gain on sale revenue recognized at the time of each loan sale and resulted in a reduction of the carrying value of the corresponding asset on brooke credit s balance sheet 
other than these reductions in asset totals  brooke credit has not established a separate credit loss reserve 
inventoried loans totaled  and  at december  and  respectively  of which  and  were delinquent days or more at december  and  respectively 
perhaps a greater risk to brooke credit is the indirect exposure to credit losses that may be incurred by participating lenders and loan pool investors 
even if brooke credit does not bear any risk of direct credit losses  if losses by participating lenders and loan pool investors reach unacceptable levels  then brooke credit may not be able to sell loans in the future 
our business model requires that our franchisees have access to credit  so the inability to sell loans would have a significant adverse effect on brooke credit

our current ratios current assets to current liabilities were   and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in our current ratio from to is primarily the result of an equity offering in and an increase in securities related to our loan securitizations in  the purchase of which was primarily financed with long term debt 
the decrease in our current ratio from to is primarily due to an increase in short term debt and current maturities of long term debt from deferred payments to sellers on acquired business inventory 
our current ratio and cash balances will be adversely affected if business inventory increases  seller loan balances are prepaid  or additional notes are retained in our portfolio

brooke corporation as a holding company  brooke corporation s primary sources of revenues are derived from its operating subsidiaries from administrative services fees  income tax sharing arrangements and dividends 
we believe that these sources of revenues are sufficient to fund brooke corporation s normal operations and pay its corporate expenses  income taxes and dividends

the equity contribution will be made from brooke corporation s cash reserves 
the sources and needs for capital of the individual subsidiaries are more fully explained below 
brooke franchise our franchise subsidiary typically generates sufficient cash from its operating and investing activities to satisfy its normal capital needs  including the funding of its business inventory and franchise statement balances 
however  to generate sufficient cash to meet its capital needs  brooke franchise is largely dependent on the recruitment of additional franchisees and on the availability of loans for these new franchisees from brooke credit 
cash of  and  respectively  was generated from franchise operating activities in and additional cash of  and  respectively  was generated from the purchase and sale of subsidiaries  business assets and inventory in and brooke credit our finance subsidiary s lending activities have been funded primarily through loan participation sales  asset backed securitizations and bank lines of credit 
brooke credit s operating activities generated cash of  in and used cash of  in the changes in operating cash resulted primarily from changes in brooke credit s loan inventory 
brooke credit expects its loan portfolio to 
table of contents increase again in the capital and loan funding needs of brooke credit are largely met through the sources discussed below 
however  to fund this anticipated loan growth in  additional brooke credit common equity  or alternative types of equity  may also be required to improve capital to asset ratios  fund collateral margin requirements of bank lines of credit  fund increases in loan inventory or fund purchases of securities associated with loan securitizations 
if additional equity is required  brooke credit does not intend to rely on equity investments from brooke corporation and will solicit investments from other investors 
brooke credit loan participations in recent years  brooke credit has relied less on loan participation sales as a source of loan funding 
nevertheless  sales of loan participation interests remains an essential source of funding 
loan participation balances increased  and  respectively  in and brooke credit expects to sell similar amounts of loan participations to its lender network in brooke credit asset securitizations in recent years  brooke credit has relied on securitizations to fund an increasing share of its loan portfolio 
asset backed securities totaling  and  respectively  were issued in and based on brooke credit s experience in recent years  it believes that it can sell the asset backed securities that it expects to issue in however  if the market for these securities is such that it cannot  then brooke credit believes that the funding shortfall can be partially offset with the sale of more loan participations through its lender network and with increased borrowing from its bank lines of credit 
brooke credit bank debt as part of brooke credit s securitization activities  it regularly invests in subordinate securities and funds these purchases largely with bank debt 
subordinate securities totaling  and  respectively  were acquired in and and corresponding bank debts of  and  respectively  were incurred in and brooke credit expects to incur additional bank debt in to acquire subordinate securities in amounts dependent on the level of securitizations undertaken in brooke credit bank lines of credit a primary brooke credit objective is to increase interest income by holding more loans for longer periods of time prior to their sale as loan participations or asset backed securities 
brooke credit has secured two bank lines of credit with combined limits of  for the purpose of funding these loans until sold 
we intend to increase our existing bank lines of credit  or acquire additional bank lines of credit  as circumstances require 
brooke brokerage brooke brokerage used  and generated  in cash from operating activities in and during  we expect to invest  in brooke brokerage if its regulatory application to become a savings and loan holding company through acquisition of federal savings bank is approved 
subject to the above uncertainties  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and funds generated from operating  investing and financing activities will be sufficient to satisfy our normal financial needs 
additionally  subject to the above  we believe that funds generated from future operating  investing and financing activities will be sufficient to satisfy our future financing needs  including the required annual principal payments of our long term debt and any future tax liabilities

critical accounting policies our established accounting policies are summarized in footnotes and to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner that is intended to provide the user of our financial statements with a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical 
these accounting policies are more fully explained in the referenced footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the following discussions summarize how we identify critical accounting estimates  the historical accuracy of these estimates  sensitivity to changes in key assumptions  and the likelihood of changes in the future 
the following discussions also indicate the uncertainties in applying these critical accounting estimates and the related variability that is likely to result in franchisees share of undistributed commissions we are obligated to pay franchisees a share of all commissions we receive 
prior to allocation of commissions to a specific policy  we cannot identify the policy owner and do not know the corresponding share percentage of commissions to be paid 
we estimate the franchisee s share of commissions to determine the approximate amount of undistributed commissions that we owe to franchisees 
an estimate of franchisees share of undistributed commissions is made based on historical rates of commission payout  management s experience and the trends in actual and forecasted commission payout rates 
although commission payout rates will vary  particularly if use of service sales centers increases significantly  we do not expect significant variances from year to year 
we regularly analyze and  if necessary  immediately 
table of contents change the estimated commission payout rates based on the actual average commission payout rates 
the commission payout rate used in to estimate franchisees share of undistributed commissions was and the actual average commission payout rate to franchisees net of profit sharing commissions was 
we believe that these estimates will not change substantially in allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised primarily of allowance for estimated losses related to amounts owed to us by franchisees for short term credit advances  which are recorded as monthly statement balances  and longer term credit advances  which are recorded as non statement balances 
losses from advances to franchisees are estimated by analyzing all advances recorded to franchise statements that had not been repaid within the previous four months  all advances recorded as non statement balances for producers in the first three months of development  total franchise statement balances  total non statement balances  historical loss rates  loss rate trends  potential for recoveries  and management s experience 
loss rates will vary and significant growth in our franchise network could accelerate those variances 
the effect of any such variances can be significant 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  the estimated allowance was approximately of the actual amount of losses from advances made to franchisees  approximately of the actual total combined franchise statement and non statement balances as of december   and approximately of the actual combined advances recorded to franchise statements that had not been repaid during the four month period ending december  and recorded as non statement balances for producers in the first three months of development 
we believe that this estimate will increase during primarily as a result of our growing franchise operations and increased emphasis on producer development for startup franchises 
unearned initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans services the initial franchise fees that we collect are typically allocated between basic services for access to our trade name  suppliers  management system and business model and buyers assistance plan services for consulting tasks such as inspection reports 
the initial franchise fees allocated to buyers assistance plan services are recognized as revenues when the individual consulting task is completed  which requires that we estimate how much of the initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plan services are attributable to each consulting task 
to make these estimates  we analyze the time required to complete the task  the level of expertise required to complete the task  the value of the task to the franchisee  and management s experience 
although the amounts of the initial franchise fees allocated are sometimes significant  the effect of variances on our results have not been significant  because most of the consulting tasks are completed prior to payment of the initial franchise fees at closing 
we believe that these estimates will not change substantially in discount  prepayment and credit loss rates used to record loan participation sales and asset backed securities sales we regularly sell the loans that we originate to banks and finance companies 
accounting for the sale of loan participations and loan securitizations and the subsequent tests for impairment are summarized in footnote loan participations and loan securitizations represent the transfer of notes receivable  by sale  to participating lenders or special purpose entities 
the fair value of retained interests and servicing assets resulting from the transferred loans are recorded in accordance with the criteria established by sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
we typically estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows  which requires us to make assumptions about credit losses  prepayment speed and discount rates 
most of our loans are adjustable rate loans on which in we assumed credit losses of each year  prepayment speeds of each year and a discount rate of 
these assumptions are made based on historical comparisons  management s experience and the trends in actual and forecasted portfolio prepayment speeds  portfolio credit losses  risk free interest rates and market interest rates 
during the fourth quarter the discount rate assumption was changed from to 
although we regularly analyze the accuracy of our assumptions of prepayment speeds  credit losses and discount rate and make changes when necessary  we believe that additional changes are unlikely in as of december   we tested retained interests for impairment and the resulting analysis of prepayments speeds 
table of contents and credit losses for the various loan pools indicated that our assumptions were historically accurate 
the effect of variances can be significant and the impact of changes in these estimates is more specifically described in footnote amortization and useful lives we acquire insurance agencies and other businesses that we intend to hold for more than one year 
we record these acquisitions as amortizable intangible assets 
accounting for amortizable intangible assets  and the subsequent tests for impairment are summarized in footnote g 
the rates of amortization of amortizable intangible assets are based on our estimate of the useful lives of the renewal rights of customer and insurance contracts purchased 
we estimate the useful lives of these assets based on historical renewal rights information  management s experience  industry standards  and trends in actual and forecasted commission payout rates 
the rates of amortization are calculated on an accelerated method declining balance based on a year life 
as of december   we tested amortizable intangible assets for impairment and the resulting analysis indicated that our assumptions were historically accurate and that the useful lives of these assets exceeded the amortization rate 
the amortizable intangible assets have a relative stable life and  unless unforeseen circumstances occur  the life is not expected to change in the future 
because of the relatively large remaining asset balance  changes in our estimates could significantly impact our results 
we believe that these estimates will not change in the rates of amortization of servicing assets are based on our estimate of repayment rates  and the resulting estimated maturity dates  of the loans that we service 
loan repayment rates are determined using assumptions about credit losses and prepayment speed as outlined in the above discussion about the fair values of servicing assets 
as of december   an analysis of prepayments speeds and credit losses indicated that our assumptions were historically accurate and the maturity date estimates were reasonable 
although significant changes in estimates are not expected  because of the relatively large remaining asset balance  changes in our estimates that significantly shorten the estimated maturity dates could significantly impact our results 
we believe that these estimates will not change in loan origination expenses brooke credit typically sells loans soon after origination and retains responsibility for loan servicing 
however  most of brooke credit s operating expenses are associated with loan origination 
we analyze our lending activities to estimate how much of brooke credit s operating expenses should be allocated to loan origination activities and  therefore  matched  or offset  with the corresponding loan origination fees collected from borrowers at loan closing 
the estimated allocations of payroll and operating expenses to loan origination activities are based on management s observations and experience  job descriptions and other employment records  and payroll records 
although not expected  significant changes in our estimation of expense allocations could significantly impact our results because loan fee amounts are significant to us 
we believe that this estimate will increase during primarily as a result of our growing loan origination activity 
income tax expense an estimate of income tax expense is based primarily on historical rates of actual income tax payments 
the estimated effective income tax rate used in to calculate income tax expense was 
although not expected  significant changes in our estimated tax rate could significantly impact our results 
we believe this estimate will not change significantly in revenue recognition policies revenue recognition is summarized in footnote e 
with respect to the previously described critical accounting policies  we believe that the application of judgments and assumptions is consistently applied and produces financial information which fairly depicts the results of operations for all years presented 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing operations  we make loans to franchisees and others to fund purchases or startups of insurance agencies or funeral homes or ongoing working capital needs 
we engage in the sale of loan 
table of contents participation interests in individual loans to banks and finance companies and the securitization of pools of insurance agency loans 
these typically meet the requirements of true sales as outlined in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the sale of loan participations and loan securitizations has resulted in the removal of a significant amount of loans from our balance sheet 
the loan sales enable us to reduce our capital investment in our financing subsidiary  reduce credit risk by removing loans from the balance sheet  recognize gains on sales of loans  and fund additional loans 
even when loans are removed from the balance sheet  however  some risk is retained with respect to those loans that are sold with full recourse and the over collateralized portion of securitized loan pools 
see retained securities and loans sold with recourse  below 
credit losses associated with recourse notes  retained interest held in securities and retained servicing obligations in excess of management s assumptions could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
however  based upon the historical performance of our loan portfolio  management feels that such a material adverse impact is unlikely 
loan sales and securitizations when the sale of a loan is classified as a true sale  gains or losses are recognized  loans are removed from the balance sheet and residual assets  representing the present value of future cash flows from the interest and servicing spread are recorded 
future cash flows are reduced by the amount of estimated credit losses and notes receivable prepayments  based on management s assumptions and estimates 
the following table reports for each of the five securitizations in which we have been involved during fiscal years  and the amount of loans sold to a qualifying special purpose entity  the amount of asset backed securities issued as a part of the securitization  the fair value of the difference between loans sold and securities issued to accredited investors and the fair value of the interest receivable retained recorded as a security for the period ended december   the portion of the security comprised of retained interest  and the portion of the security comprised of retained equity in the special purchase entity

purchasers of these notes receivable obtained full control over the transferred assets ie notes receivable and obtained the right  free of conditions that constrain them from taking advantage of that right  to pledge or exchange the notes receivable 
furthermore  the agreements to transfer assets do not entitle  or obligate  us to repurchase or redeem the notes receivable before their maturity  except in the event of an uncured breach of a representation or warranty 

table of contents servicing and retained interest assets when we sell loan participations  we generally retain servicing income and recognize non cash gains for the servicing benefits related to the loan sale 
in recognizing such gains  we book a loan servicing asset on our balance sheet equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from the servicing spread 
we recognize such assets only when the income allocated to our servicing responsibilities exceeds our cost of servicing  which we typically estimate at of the loan value being serviced 
on loan participations  we are typically paid annual servicing fees ranging from to of the outstanding loan balance 
on loan securitizations  we are typically paid annual servicing fees ranging from to of the outstanding securitized loan balances 
when the annual service fees paid to us are less than the minimum cost of servicing  which is estimated at of the outstanding balance  a servicing liability is recorded 
to the extent that the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and investors and the rate received by brooke credit from borrowers exceeds the maximum percentage allocated to the servicing benefit  brooke credit recognizes a non cash asset  called an interest receivable asset  on its balance sheet 
this amount is equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from this interest spread 
with respect to sale of loan participations  our right to interest income is not subordinate to the purchaser s interests and we share interest income with purchasers on a pro rata basis 
although not subordinate to the purchaser s interests  our retained interest is subject to credit and prepayment risks on the transferred assets 
on loan participations sold with recourse  our retained interest is subject to credit risk on the transferred assets

retained securities the terms of brooke credit s securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
brooke credit retains ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool and borrows money from commercial banks to fund this investment 
as such  our retained interest is subject to credit and prepayment risks on the transferred assets 
as of december   brooke credit had subordinate investment interest in loan pools totaling  part of which is the carrying value of our retained interest in asset backed securities  and has borrowed  as of december  from commercial banks to fund this investment 

table of contents in connection with the recognition of non cash gains for the interest benefits of asset backed securities sales  the present value of future cash flows were recorded as an interest receivable asset and included on the balance sheet as part of the investment securities balance 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows in thousands estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in asset backed securities we annually evaluate and measure the retained interest and servicing assets for potential impairment 
impairment testing involves comparing our current discounted value of future interest and servicing revenue with our carrying value for the retained interest and servicing assets 
if our current discounted value is less than our carrying value  we recognize an impairment equal to the difference in value 
no impairment was recognized in the fiscal years ended december   and in addition  we conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the potential impact of a to change in the key economic assumptions used in valuing our retained interest and servicing assets 
these key economic assumptions include prepayment speed  expected credit losses and discount rate 
as of december   an increase in these key economic assumptions by to generally results in decreases of to in the value of the retained interest and servicing assets 
more drastic changes to economic and market conditions than those we have modeled would likely lead to greater diminution in the value of the retained interest and servicing assets 
loans sold with recourse the business and real estate loans on our balance sheet at december  and   and  respectively  were sold to various participating lenders with recourse to brooke credit corporation 
such recourse is limited to the amount of actual principal and interest loss incurred and any such loss is not due for payment to the participating lender until such time as all collateral is liquidated  all actions against the borrower are completed and all liquidation proceeds applied 
however  participating lenders may be entitled to periodic advances from brooke credit corporation against liquidation proceeds in the amount of regular loan payments 
at december   all such recourse loans a had no balances more than days past due  b had adequate collateral  and c were not in default 
market conditions and strategies affecting sale and securitization transactions our lending operations depend on our ability to sell either loan participation interests or securities backed by our originated loans to banks and finance companies 
we believe that our relationships with participating lenders and loan pool investors have been good  that investor interest in our loans has been strong  and that we will continue to have available purchasers of our loan participation interests and asset backed securities 
several factors  however  will affect our ability to sell participation interests in our loans and to complete securitizations  including conditions in the securities markets  generally  conditions in the asset backed securities markets  changes in interest rates and their impact on credit losses and prepayment speed  the credit quality and performance of our financial instruments and loans  our ability to adequately service our financial instruments and loans  and  the absence of any material downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our securitizations 

table of contents one of our goals is to fund an increasing number of originated loans through our line of credit with dz bank  leading up to the time of loan securitizations 
to do so  our debt is expected to increase 
the increase in our debt may cause our network of participating lenders to become uncomfortable and  as a result  we may not be able to sell participation interests in loans we originate on terms acceptable to us or at all 
such result would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth 
accordingly  we are cautiously monitoring our increased debt totals resulting from dz bank funding activities and the comfort of the network of participating lenders and will modify our method of funding practices as needed to maintain a significant network of purchasers of loans 
a material change in any of the foregoing economic and market conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue sales of our loan participations or loan securitizations 
in addition  such changes in economic and market conditions could lead to an impairment in the value of our retained interest and servicing assets 
either the loss of our loan sale markets or an impairment in the retained interest and servicing assets could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in the event of such material change in economic and market conditions  we would likely examine a range of strategic options  including evaluating our current capital structure  the availability of credit sources in addition to the loan participation and loan securitization markets  a possible reduction in the expansion of our franchise network  a possible curtailment in our lending operations  and an examination of our internal cost and operating structure 
we would make no such change prior to thoroughly evaluating our alternatives and market conditions 
while our management cannot predict market conditions or the reactions of participating lenders to changes in market conditions or our strategies  we are unaware of any trends or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to materially reduce our ability to sell loans and remove them from our balance sheet under current accounting rules  or any need to consider any such strategic options at this time 
proposed accounting changes in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued three exposure drafts which amend statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the final standards are scheduled to be issued during the calendar year the first exposure draft seeks to clarify the derecognition requirements for financial assets and the initial measurement of interests related to transferred financial assets that are held by a transferor 
our current off balance sheet securitizations in our lending services segment would be required to be consolidated in our financial statements based on the provisions of the exposure draft 
we will continue to monitor the status of the exposure draft and consider what changes  if any  could be made to the structure of the securitizations to continue to derecognize loans transferred to the securitization special purpose entities 
at december   the securitization special purpose entities held loans totaling million  which we would be required to consolidate into our financial statements under the provisions of this exposure draft 
the second exposure draft would require servicing rights to be initially valued at fair value 
this provision would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
in addition  this exposure draft would permit us to choose to continue to amortize servicing rights in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income  as currently required under sfas  or report servicing rights at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
we have not yet determined how we would elect to account for servicing rights under this provision or the potential impact to the financial statements 
the third exposure draft  among other things  would establish a requirement to evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are free standing derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
alternatively  this exposure draft would permit fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that 
table of contents otherwise would require bifurcation 
our residual interests in securitizations typically have interests in derivative instruments embedded within the securitization 
we have not yet determined if these embedded derivatives meet the criteria for bifurcation as outlined in the exposure draft

related party transactions see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for information about related party transactions 
impact of inflation and general economic conditions although inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  increases in the inflation rate are generally associated with increased interest rates 
a significant and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect our franchisees ability to repay the variable rate loans that we have made to them and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
such an interest rate increase could also adversely affect our profitability by increasing our interest expenses and other operating expenses 
a significant change in the credit markets could also have an adverse impact on our operations 
our lending operations depend on our ability to sell either loan participation interests or securities backed by our insurance agency loans to banks and finance companies 
several factors will affect our ability to sell participation interests in our loans and to complete securitizations  including conditions in the securities markets  generally  conditions in the asset backed securities markets  changes in interest rates and their impact on credit losses and prepayment speed  the credit quality and performance of our financial instruments and loans  our ability to adequately service our financial instruments and loans  and the absence of any material downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our securitizations 
a significant change in interest rates or in the willingness to extend credit could have a significant and adverse impact on our ability to make loans and  by extension  to continue expanding our agency network 
a significant change in interest rates could also affect the cash flows associated with our servicing assets and liabilities  our retained interest assets related to our loan participation and securitization sales  and the value of our investment in the subordinate interests in our securitizations 
we make certain assumptions about the rate of prepayment by our borrowers and the credit losses of our loan portfolio 
in the event of a sudden increase in interest rates  it is reasonable to expect that credit losses would increase  as our borrowers found it increasingly costly to make their interest payments 
our assumptions about the prepayment rates on loans could also be subject to change in the event of a sudden increase or decrease in interest rates 
our business is also dependent on the cyclical pricing of property and casualty insurance  which may adversely affect our franchisees performance and  thus  our financial performance 
our franchisees primarily derive their revenues from commissions paid by insurance companies  which commissions are based largely on the level of premiums charged by such insurance companies 
in turn  we earn fees from our franchisees based upon the commissions earned by our franchisees 
because these premium rates are cyclical  our financial 
table of contents performance is dependent  in part  on the fluctuations in insurance pricing 
although the current insurance market generally may be characterized as soft  with a flattening or decreasing of premiums in most lines of insurance  it is likely that insurance pricing will decrease further in the future  subjecting us to lower commissions on the insurance placed by our franchisees 
a steep decline in insurance pricing could have a significant and adverse impact on our franchisees  because the commissions that they earn would likely decrease along with insurance pricing 
that adverse impact would likely reduce our share of our franchisees insurance commissions and could also hurt our franchisees ability to make timely payment of principal and interest on our loans 
a general decline in economic activity in the united states or in one of the states or geographic regions in which we operate such as california  texas  the southwest  the midwest or the southeast  could also affect our results and financial condition 
an adverse change in economic activity could reduce the ability of individuals and small businesses the key customers for our franchisees to purchase insurance and other financial services 
in such event  the revenue growth rate of our franchisees could flatten or decline  in turn reducing our revenues and hurting our franchisees ability to make timely interest and principal payments on their loans 
all other schedules have been omitted because they are either inapplicable or the required information has been provided in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we originate loans which will generally be sold to funding institutions as participation interests or to accredited investors as asset backed securities 
the substantial majority of the loans are adjustable rate loans based on a prime rate plus a margin and interest rate changes will impact their value  and may impact credit losses and prepayments associated with the loans 
a significant rise in interest rates may result in an increase in credit losses 
a significant decrease in interest rates may result in an increase in prepayment speed as borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates 
when interest rates on our loan assets do not adjust at the same rates as our liabilities associated with those assets  our earnings are subject to risk 
interest rate risk associated with loan assets and funding liabilities prior to the sale of the loans is minimized by the fact that loans are generally held for less than one year 
we further manage interest rate risk on loan assets and liabilities remaining after the sale of the loans by matching our cost of funds with the rate structure of the underlying loans 
we apply interest rates on those assets and liabilities that float at a spread above the prime rate  so that  when interest rates on the assets adjust  the interest rates on the liabilities adjust correspondingly 
when loans are sold  and the sale of participation interests or asset backed securities is classified as a true sale  we record a gain on sale for the interest benefit based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the underlying loans  net of prepayment and credit loss assumptions 
when the sale of a loan participation interest is accounted for as a true sale  we retain servicing responsibilities for which we receive annual servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance 
the gain or loss associated with loan servicing is determined based on present value calculations of future cash flows from the servicing the underlying loans  net of prepayment assumptions 
the present value calculations of future cash flows of underlying loans and future cash flows from the servicing of underlying loans are based in part on management s estimates of discount rates 
underlying loans with adjustable interest rates are evaluated separately from loans with fixed interest rates 
a significant rise in interest rates could result in the impairment of retained interest and servicing assets and adversely affect the company s business financial condition and results of operation 
impairment is evaluated and measured annually 
no impairment was recognized in the years ended december    and we continuously monitor market conditions  interest rate changes and market comparables  evaluate the 
table of contents propriety of the discount rate utilized in our assumptions  and assess interest rate sensitivity as an indication of interest rate risk 
at december   key economic assumptions used in measuring the retained interests and servicing assets when loans were sold or securitized during the year were as follows rates per annum business loans adjustable rate stratum business loans fixed rate stratum prepayment speed weighted average life months expected credit losses discount rate rates for these loans are adjusted based on an index for most loans  the new york prime rate plus 
contract terms vary but  for most loans  the rate is adjusted annually on december st 
beginning in the third quarter of  contract terms on new loans are adjusted monthly or daily to an index 
during the fourth quarter of  the discount rate assumption was changed from to 
at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate percent and percent adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows business loans fixed adjustable rate stratum in thousands except percentages prepayment speed annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change expected credit losses annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate annual impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change during the fourth quarter of  the discount rate assumption was changed from to 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the retained interests and servicing assets is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
the above adverse changes for prepayment speed and discount rate are calculated on our retained interests and servicing assets on loans sold totaling  the above adverse changes for expected credit losses are calculated on the company s retained interests in loans sold with recourse to participating lenders and loans sold in securitizations
