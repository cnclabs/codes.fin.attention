item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere herein 
executive overview in  we continued to execute on our strategic goals of growing our business while simultaneously generating increasing levels of net free cash flow  which we define as having cash provided by operating activities exceeding cash used for investing  and improving profitability 
we delivered on our goals by increasing our digital room base during the year by more than  net rooms 
as of december   of our guest pay interactive room base  or  rooms  were equipped with a digital system 
cash from operations increased to million for the year 
after deducting all capital investment activities of million  we generated million of net free cash flow during this represents a million improvement over profitability improved as operating income increased by to million compared to million in  and net loss was reduced by from million in to million in in addition to the continued expansion of our digital base  we managed capital expenditures per new or converted room through market and product segmentations and engineering development 
new digital room installation costs decreased during the year to per room compared to in  while the cost of converting an analog room to our digital platform decreased to per room 
during  total revenue increased  or million as compared to movie revenue per room decreased year over year and was primarily attributable to lower purchases of hollywood movies and the impact from hurricane katrina 
due to katrina  approximately  rooms were not in service as of december  revenue per room from other interactive services increased driven by price changes associated with basic cable services and increased revenue from our high speed internet access hsia services  tv on demand  and music products  and was offset in part by our tv internet initiative  which removed the service from poorly performing rooms 
the initiative effectively decreased revenue by approximately million while lowering direct operating costs by approximately million

per average guest pay room  sg a expenses increased to per month from per month in the increase was primarily due to higher compensation  benefits and marketing expenses and the effect of a legal expense recovery of  our depreciation and amortization decreased million primarily driven by higher cost assets being fully depreciated while the cost basis of more recently deployed guest pay systems are lower 
per average guest pay room  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to in compared to in the prior year 
we continue our efforts to de leverage our balance sheet with the reduction of our equipment investments through market and product segmentations and engineering development  reduction of interest costs by prepaying on our long term debt  redemption of long term debt and prudent management of working capital 
cash at december  was million compared to million at december  the reduction in cash was due to the million prepayment on our term loan 
we continue to develop and secure the rights to use technologies that enable us to deliver high definition television programming 
in order to secure distribution rights for hd and other digital content we are required to demonstrate appropriate security measures to protect that content 
during  we entered into agreements with directv  espn  lion s gate  and paramount to provide high definition guest room entertainment content to the hotels we serve that are equipped to receive and display hdtv 
in  our industry leading signeture hdtv sm solution coupled with our lodgenet media management system helped us secure two key contracts 
starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc  selected lodgenet as starwood s sole preferred provider for interactive television services for its westin  w hotels  sheraton  and four points by sheraton brands located in the united states and canada 
this portfolio of hotels currently includes properties having approximately  rooms of which we currently serve approximately  rooms 
secondly  the ritz carlton hotel company  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of marriott international  inc  extended its exclusive master agreement with us 
the agreement  representing approximately  guest rooms  allows us to serve all properties of the ritz carlton within the united states and canada through we continue to explore revenue growth opportunities within our core lodging business 
these include  but are not limited to  new content and products such as hotel sportsnet sm our new daily subscription of sports programming including nba league pass  nfl sunday ticket and espn s gameplan and full court packages 
in addition  we have efforts underway that are focused on enhancing our marketing directly to the hotel guest 
these efforts are facilitated by the capabilities of our lodgenet media management system lmms that allows us to refresh interactive menus  promote different products and different titles to different demographics and change pricing of our products  selection and promotions based on time of day or day of week  among other marketing efforts to the guest 
also during  we expanded our efforts to develop linear and on demand advertising and promotional messages 
we are able to selectively place these messages at properties and to record the number of views and the viewing time per view using lmms 
this business model has the potential of generating revenue from the advertiser in contrast to the hotel or the guest 
in  we announced the formation of a sales and marketing relationship with mckesson corporation  the world s largest healthcare services and information technology company  to offer our interactive television system and content as part of mckesson s horizon patientvision tm system 
during  we focused on developing our healthcare business and had nine facilities under contract as of december  in this market  we sell our interactive systems to mckesson corporation for resale to their customers  and also contract directly with healthcare facilities sold by lodgenet or through mdm commercial  a licensed sales agent 
revenue comes from the initial sale of system hardware  software licensing  and implementation services  and we additionally earn recurring revenues  under long term contracts  by providing entertainment content  software maintenance and technical field service 
we will continue to pursue opportunities in the healthcare market in lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents guest pay interactive services 
our primary source of revenue is providing in room  interactive television services to the lodging industry  for which the hotel guest pays on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
our services include on demand movies  network based video games  music and music videos  internet on television which does not require a laptop  and television on demand programming 
our total guest generated revenue depends on a number of factors  including the number of rooms on our network 
we can increase revenue over time by increasing the number of rooms served by our interactive systems 
our ability to expand our room base is dependent on a number of factors  including the attractiveness of our technology  service and support to hotels currently operating without an interactive television system  newly constructed hotel properties  and hotels with expiring contracts currently served by our competitors 
the variety of services offered at the hotel 
rooms equipped with our digital system generate higher revenue than rooms equipped with our tape based system primarily because they offer a greater variety of services and content choices 
we plan to continue to grow the revenue we generate per average room by the installation of our digital system in all newly contracted rooms and by converting selected tape based rooms to our digital system in exchange for long term contract extensions 
the popularity  timeliness and amount of content offered at the hotel 
our revenues vary to a certain degree with the number  timeliness and popularity of movie content available for viewing 
historically  a decrease in the availability of popular movie content has adversely impacted revenue 
although not completely within our control  we seek to program and promote the most popular available movie content and other content to maximize revenue and gross profit 
the price of the service purchased by the hotel guest 
generally  we control the prices charged for our products and services and manage pricing in an effort to maximize revenue and overall gross profit 
we establish pricing based on such things as the demographics of the property served  the popularity of the content and overall economic conditions 
our technology enables us to measure popularity of our content and make decisions to best position such content and optimize revenue from such content 
the occupancy rate at the property 
our revenue also varies depending on hotel occupancy rates  which are subject to a number of factors  including seasonality  general economic conditions and world events  such as terrorist threats or public health issues 
occupancy rates are typically higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
we target higher occupancy properties in diverse demographic and geographic locations in an effort to mitigate occupancy related risks 
the primary direct costs of providing guest pay interactive services are license fees paid to major motion picture studios  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for non exclusive distribution rights of recently released major motion pictures  commissions paid to our hotel customers  which are also based on a percent of guest generated revenue  fixed monthly programming charges paid primarily to directv for satellite delivered basic and premium television programming  internet connectivity costs  license fees  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for television on demand  music  music video  video games and sports programming  and one time license fees paid for independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences 
other services 
in addition to the sales of equipment to our international markets  we continued to promote the sale and installation of high speed internet equipment coupled with maintenance and customer support services 
while this is a highly competitive area  we believe we have important advantages as a result of our existing hotel customer relationships  our nationwide field service network  and our hour call center which provides service seven days a week 
we also generate revenue from the sale of content and services directly to our hotel customers  which are generally provided free to hotel guests 
included in these services is satellite delivered basic and premium television programming for which the hotel pays us a fixed monthly charge per room 
we compete with local cable television operators by tailoring different programming packages to provide specific channels desired by the hotel subscriber  which typically reduces the overall cost to the hotel for the services provided

table of contents key metrics rooms served one of the metrics we monitor is the growth  net of de installations  of our interactive television network 
de installation activity has not had a material effect on our growth  averaging between to of total installed rooms per year over the last five years 
in the years indicated  we installed our systems in the following number of net new rooms and had the following total rooms installed as of december total rooms served total guest pay interactive rooms new guest pay interactive rooms amounts shown are net of de installations during the period 
the gross numbers of new rooms installed were  in   in  and  in guest pay interactive rooms are equipped with our interactive television system  which includes high definition hd  digital and tape based systems 
total rooms served include guest pay interactive rooms  rooms served by international licensees  and properties receiving only basic and premium television services 
as a result of hurricane katrina  room count as of december   was reduced by  rooms 
digital room growth we continue to expand our digital base as we install our digital system in all newly contracted rooms as well as converting select tape based served rooms to the digital system in exchange for contract extensions 
rooms equipped with our digital system generally generate greater revenue since the range of services is greater than rooms equipped with our tape based systems 
our goal is to have approximately and of our room base installed with a digital system by the end of digital room installations total digital rooms installed digital rooms as a percent of total guest pay interactive rooms total digital room count as of december   was reduced by  rooms due to the impact of hurricane katrina 
total room count was reduced by an additional  tape based rooms due to the impact of hurricane katrina

table of contents cost of installation the average per room cost associated with a digital installation has continued to decline due to our ongoing reengineering  which simplifies the system while adding enhancements  lower component costs  product segmentation and reduced cost of assembly and installation 
the following table sets forth our average installation and conversion cost per room during the years ended december average cost per room new installation average cost per room conversion revenue per room guest pay revenue can fluctuate based on several factors including the popularity of movie content and the availability and popularity of free alternative programming 
the guest pay revenue per room declined primarily due to lower movie purchases  particularly in the first three quarters  our tv internet profitability enhancement initiative  and the impact from hurricane katrina 
we estimate the impact from having the katrina impacted rooms out of service reduced guest pay revenue in by approximately million or per room 
the tv internet initiative  which removed this service from approximately  poorly performing rooms  is estimated to have reduced revenue by approximately million or per average guest pay room 
the following table sets forth the components of our guest pay revenue per room for the years ended december average monthly revenue per room movies other interactive services total per guest pay room direct costs guest pay direct costs exclusive of operating expenses and depreciation and amortization discussed separately below for interactive services include movie license fees  license fees for other interactive services  the commission retained by the hotel  programming  and other related costs

the following table sets forth our net loss for the years ended december net loss lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents free cash flow one of our goals is to generate net free cash flow  which we define as having cash provided by operating activities exceeding cash used for investing 
we generally seek to generate net free cash flow to reduce our historical reliance on external financing to grow our business 
in addition to increasing revenue and controlling expenses  we can manage our actions related to this goal by reducing the per room installation cost of a digital room and by varying the number of rooms we install with the digital system in any given period 
our progress toward the goal of generating increased levels of net free cash flow is set forth in the following table in thousands of dollars cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities difference expansion capital investment the improvement from was driven by a reduction in the cost to install a digital room  year over year  the management of operating costs and a decrease in interest expense due to the prepayment of million of our term b notes 
these factors have eliminated the need for cash provided by external financing in and new revenue sources in  we began offering our interactive television systems into the healthcare industry through a sales and marketing relationship with mckesson corporation 
in this market  we sold our interactive system and license our software to mckesson or individual healthcare facilities  and earn recurring revenues from the provision of hardware and software service and maintenance activities  and the sale of entertainment content 
in addition to mckesson  we expanded our relationship with a healthcare television sales organization  which also represents our interactive television system in the healthcare market 
in addition  we continued investigating other adjacent markets into which we can sell our interactive television system 
we recently signed an agreement with idleaire technologies for the sale and installation of our digital system into travel centers and terminals 
idleaire is planning to install its patented advanced truckstop electrification ate systems in approximately travel centers and terminal locations  having more than  total spaces  over the next fifteen months 
idleaire will be purchasing our interactive television platform  licensing our software  and contracting with us for a variety of entertainment and service options as part of its overall service offering 
another adjacent market where we have opportunities to generate new revenue growth is the timeshare market 
we estimate that the timeshare market has approximately  units in the united states  most of which do not have interactive television services 
in these markets  we intend to sell our system and license our software  and earn recurring revenue from the provision of hardware and software maintenance and sale of entertainment content

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  we have required substantial amounts of capital to fund operations  expand our business and service existing indebtedness 
since  we have transitioned to a net free cash flow position 
we define net free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for investing purposes 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million while cash used for investing activities  including growth related capital investments  was million  resulting in a net difference of million 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million while cash used for investing activities  including growth related capital investments  was million  resulting in a net change of million

we used the net proceeds to repay million of our bank credit facility term loan and the remaining million of our senior notes 
the remaining proceeds of approximately million were retained as cash for use in general corporate purposes 
depending on the rate of growth in our business and other factors  we expect to incur capital expenditures of to million in based on expected capital expenditures  we estimate in we will install between  and  gross new rooms and convert between  and  existing rooms from tape based to digital systems in exchange for long term contract extensions 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash on hand  operating cash flow and the revolver portion of our credit facility  which matures in we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flow and borrowing available under the credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our future growth and financing obligations 
as of december   working capital was million  compared to million at december  the decrease was due to the million prepayment on our term b notes

in connection with our programming related agreements  we may guarantee minimum royalties for specific periods or by individual programming content 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors 
our hotel customers typically experience higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns and  accordingly  we historically have higher revenue in those quarters 
however  quarterly revenue can be affected by the availability of popular content during those quarters and by commercial televised events such as the olympics  among other things 
we have no control over when new movies are released  how popular they will be or the popularity of other televised events

our primary cost drivers are predetermined rates  such as hotel commissions  license fees paid for major motion pictures and other content  or one time fixed fees for independent films 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based upon the available information 
the following critical policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from various sources as follows guest pay services 
our primary source of revenue is from providing in room  interactive television services to the lodging industry  which the hotel guest typically purchases on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
these services include on demand movies  on demand games  music and music video  internet on television and television on demand 
we recognize revenue from the sale of these guest pay services in the period in which such services are sold to the hotel guest and when collection is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of a purchase exists through a guest buy transaction recorded on our system 
no future performance obligations exist with respect to these types of services once they have been provided to the hotel guest 
the prices related to our products or services are fixed or determinable prior to delivery of the products or services 
free to guest services 
we generate revenue from the sale of basic and premium television programming to individual hotels 
in contrast to guest pay services  where the hotel guest is charged directly for the service  we charge the hotel for our free to guest services 
we recognize revenue from the sale of free to guest services in the period in which such services are sold and when collection is reasonably assured 
we establish the prices charged to each hotel and no future performance obligations exist on programming that has been provided to the hotel 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists through our long term contract with each hotel 
we also have advance billings from one month to three months for certain free to guest programming services where the revenue is deferred and recognized in the periods that services are provided 
high speed internet access system sales 
we provide high speed internet access through the sale and installation of equipment 
revenue from the sale and installation of this equipment is recognized when the equipment is installed 
the delivery and installation of the equipment are concurrent 
in addition  this equipment has stand alone value to the customer 
the software used within these systems is not proprietary and can be supplied by other vendors unrelated to us 
equipment prices are fixed and determinable prior to delivery and are based on objective and reliable sales evidence from a stand alone basis 
high speed internet access service and support 
we provide ongoing maintenance  service and call center support services to hotel properties that have been installed by us and also to hotel properties that have been installed by other providers 
in addition  we provide  in some cases  the hotel property with the portal to access the internet 
we receive monthly service fees from such hotel properties for our maintenance services and internet access 
we recognize the service fee ratably over the term of the contract 
the prices for these services are fixed and determinable prior to delivery of the service

lodgenet entertainment corporation form k 
table of contents hotel system sales and support 
we also market and sell our guest pay interactive systems to hotels  along with recurring support for interactive content  software maintenance and technical field service for a fixed fee 
revenue from the sale and installation of the interactive system  including the operating software  is deferred and recognized over the term of the contract  generally five years  due to inseparable proprietary software elements 
the multiple elements are not separable because the proprietary software is required to operate the system and we do not license or sell the software separately under this business model 
the interactive system prices are fixed and determinable prior to delivery 
revenue from this arrangement  which includes equipment  operating software  interactive content  and maintenance services  is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
other

these sales are not made under multiple element arrangements and we recognize the revenue when the equipment is delivered or service repair or installation has been performed 
no future performance obligation exists on an equipment sale or on a repair service that has been provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considering several factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable  bad debt recoveries  and contract terms between the hotel and us 
in accordance with our hotel contracts  monies collected by the hotel for interactive television services are held in trust on our behalf 
collectibility is reasonably assured as supported by our credit check process and nominal write off history 
if the financial condition of a hotel chain or group of hotels were to deteriorate and reduce the ability to remit our monies  we may be required to increase our allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
allowance for excess or obsolete system components 
we regularly evaluate component levels to ascertain build requirements based on our backlog and service requirements based on our current installed base 
when a certain system component becomes obsolete due to technological changes and it is determined that the component cannot be utilized within our current installed base  we record a provision for excess and obsolete component inventory based on estimated forecasts of product demand and service requirements 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of service requirements and future production  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological advances could have an impact on the value of system components and reported operating results 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment is stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
installed guest pay and free to guest systems consist of equipment and related costs of installation  including certain payroll costs  sales commissions and customer acquisition costs 
maintenance costs  which do not significantly extend the useful lives of the respective assets  and repair costs are charged to guest pay operations as incurred 
we begin depreciating guest pay and free to guest systems when such systems are installed and activated 
depreciation of other equipment begins when such equipment is placed in service 
we attribute no salvage value to equipment  and depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings guest pay systems installed system costs customer acquisition costs system components software costs other equipment allowance for system removal 
we de install properties through the course of normal operations due to a number of factors  including poor revenue performance  hotel bankruptcy or collection issues  hotel closings  and change in service provider 
we regularly evaluate our backlog of properties scheduled for de installation and record a provision for estimated system removal costs 
the costs incurred as a result of de installation include the labor to de install the system as well as unamortized installation costs 
over the last five years  de installation activity has averaged approximately to of our installed room base

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including potential losses resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest 
at december   we had debt totaling million 
we have an interest rate swap arrangement covering debt with a notional amount of million to effectively change the underlying debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the term of the swap agreement 
after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangement  we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase to interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by an estimated million 
the impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase to interest rates would be approximately  assuming other variables remain constant 
foreign currency transactions 
a portion of our revenues is derived from the sale of guest pay services in canada 
the results of operations and financial position of our operations in canada are measured in canadian dollars and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in canada are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses and liabilities are generally incurred in canadian dollars 
the reported income of our canadian subsidiary will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
additionally  a portion of our assets is based in canada and is translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  our consolidated assets will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
during our consolidated balance sheet increased  due to foreign currency fluctuations
