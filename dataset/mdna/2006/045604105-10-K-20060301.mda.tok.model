overview 
we are engaged primarily in the operation of multifamily residential units that we own 
we also provide asset and property management services to third party owners of multifamily residential units for which we are paid fees 
our primary source of cash and revenue from operations is rents from the leasing of owned apartment units 
approximately of our consolidated revenues were generated from the leasing of these owned units for the year ended december   and approximately of the property revenues generated by these owned properties during the year ended december   were related to the market rate properties 
we consider property noi to be an important indicator of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenues and interest income less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties  which has the largest impact of all of our sources of income and expense on our financial condition and operating results 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for additional information regarding property noi and total net operating income  in addition to a reconciliation of total noi to consolidated net income loss in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our four reportable segments are based upon types of property and services and consist of our market rate properties of revenues  properties we acquired  developed or sold within the prior year  which segment is referenced as disposition acquisition of total revenues  our affordable housing properties of total revenues and management and service operations of revenues of which is derived from third party asset and property management operations 
our same store market rate midwest portfolio  consisting of properties  containing  units  accounts for of our revenues and of our noi 
while we achieved modest growth in net collected rents of less than in our midwest markets  we face continuing challenges in achieving higher growth in this market primarily due to a sluggish midwest economy with higher unemployment rates  lack of job growth and low mortgage interest rates that have resulted in more would be apartment residents opting instead for home ownership 
in response to these conditions  our strategy is to reduce our midwest property exposure by selling certain midwest properties and acquiring properties in other markets that have a greater potential for growth 
in  we sold a unit property located in cleveland  ohio and acquired a unit property located in west palm beach  florida and a unit property located in atlanta  georgia 
in  we intend to continue with our strategy of reducing our midwest presence by selling properties 
however  strong competition for replacement properties in our targeted growth markets are likely to hinder our ability to find suitable replacement properties that satisfy our investment criteria 
we may also consider selling assets in any market  including the mid atlantic and southeast markets  where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide a significantly greater return on equity and an increase in cash flow 
another major challenge for us is to reduce overall interest rate charges on our borrowings  currently a weighted average of 
we plan to accomplish this goal by using sale proceeds to pay off debt or refinance existing debt at lower interest rates 
in order to increase property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenues  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the asset level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
expectations portfolio performance we expect to increase our market rate property noi by approximately to in  with operating margins remaining relatively flat 
interest expense and general and administrative expense we expect interest expense to decrease approximately million based on utilizing sale proceeds to pay down or refinance debt at lower interest rates 
defeasance costs associated with these prepayments are expected to be approximately million 
additionally  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase approximately as a result of anticipated increases in payroll and bonuses and other costs 
property sales we plan to sell at least million of properties in share buyback we plan to continue to use a portion of property sales proceeds to repurchase our common stock 
under our board of directors authorization to repurchase up to million of our common shares  we had million still available to purchase as of december  ohio tax law changes 
on june   house bill number hb was signed into law 
the bill  effective july   made several changes to ohio s tax code  including the elimination of a property tax rollback for certain real property used in business retroactive to january  as a result of the elimination of this rollback  we recognized an increase in real estate tax expense of approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and anticipate that the real estate tax expense related to the rollback will be similar 
we do not believe that the other changes to ohio s tax code included in the bill will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  our service companies are subject to federal income tax 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs s 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
we have elected trs status for all of our service companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows cash sources uses for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    real estate and fixed asset additions    net proceeds from property dispositions   joint venture distribution from sale proceeds other investing activities  increases decreases in debt net    issuance of class b cumulative redeemable preferred shares  redemption of class a preferred shares  cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid    purchase of treasury shares under repurchase plan  net cash from other financing activities  cash decrease increase    our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the lines of credit and proceeds from property sales 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in compared to was primarily due to an increase in property operating and maintenance expenses  an increase in interest expense and a reduction in net painting service revenues 
these factors were partially offset by increases in property revenues 
see the discussion of our results of operations below for additional information regarding these fluctuations 
additionally  in april  our ceo repaid two notes totaling million  which were scheduled to mature may  we obtained cash from the following additional sources during million in mortgage notes obtained  million in net proceeds from the sale of properties  million obtained through the issuance of trust preferred securities  and  in proceeds related to stock option exercises 
we utilized cash for the following additional purposes during million in acquisition  recurring and investment capital additions  million reduction in mortgage notes  million to redeem class a preferred shares from the funds received in december through the offering of class b preferred shares  million in dividends and distributions paid  million to repurchase our common shares  million reduction in line of credit borrowings  and million in debt procurement costs paid 
cash provided by operations during increased compared to primarily as a result of improved performance at the properties due to increased property revenues and decreased property operating and maintenance expenses  which were partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses 
we received cash proceeds of million from the sale of one operating property  of which million was used to purchase the interest in a joint venture partnership in which we were a partner 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
we issued million of class b cumulative redeemable preferred shares and received net cash proceeds of million after incurring costs of million 
the net funds received from this issuance were used in january to redeem all of the outstanding class a cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
additionally  we received  from the exercise of stock options 
lines of credit 
at december   we had a million line of credit available for regular borrowings and letter of credit transactions 
this line is secured by a market rate property 
at december   a letter of credit in the amount of  had been issued against this line 
this line of credit matures on december  borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at either the one month reference rate or libor plus at our option 
there were no borrowings outstanding at either december  or december  on this line 
our million secured line of credit was unavailable at december   because the property securing that credit line was sold 
in february  we identified a replacement property to serve as security for this credit line and amended the loan terms by increasing the credit line to million with interest calculated at libor plus 
borrowings under the line may be restricted based upon the operating performance of the property 
there were borrowings of million outstanding on this line of credit at december  there were no borrowings outstanding on this line at december  shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission relating to a possible offering  from time to time  of debt securities  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
in december  we issued million of class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares under this registration statement 
the remaining availability under the shelf registration at december  is million 
currently  we do not have access to issue any debt securities under this shelf registration 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources  such as secured borrowings primarily the lines of credit  and property sales proceeds are available and should be sufficient to meet operating requirements  capital additions  mortgage amortization payments and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
our main source for paying down debt  acquiring properties or buying back our stock is expected to be the net proceeds from the sale of properties 
although we intend to sell at least million of properties in  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact our ability to execute such sales

affordable housing properties represent properties subject to hud regulations 
overall  the loss from continuing operations increased million when comparing to and decreased million when comparing to during the to comparison period  total revenues increased primarily due to increases in property revenues 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in painting service revenues and fee revenues 
total expenses for this comparison period increased primarily due to increases in property operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in painting service expenses 
during the to comparison period  total revenues increased primarily due to increases in property and painting service revenues 
total expenses for this comparison period decreased primarily due to reductions in property operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses

property revenue collections are primarily impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels 
we measure these factors using indicators such as physical occupancy number of units occupied divided by total number of units  and average monthly net collected rent per unit gross potential rents less vacancies and concessions divided by total number of units 
this information is presented in the following table for the years ended december   and information for the years ended december  and reflect results based upon the operating properties and their respective segments as of december  for the year ended december  average monthly physical net collected occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions  market rate affordable housing for the year ended december  average monthly physical net collected occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions market rate affordable housing for the year ended december  average monthly physical net collected occupancy rent per unit acquisitions dispositions n a n a market rate affordable housing rental revenues increased million in compared to primarily as a result of contributions by the acquisition disposition segment one property acquired in july and two properties acquired in 
these three properties contributed an increase of million in rental revenues in compared to there were no revenues in this segment for the year ended december  rental revenues for the market rate properties decreased  in compared to and decreased  in compared to the decrease in compared to was primarily due to an increase in concessions during the third and fourth quarters of in an effort to maintain physical occupancy  particularly in the midwest markets 
rental revenues for the affordable housing properties increased  in compared to and  in compared to primarily as a result of hud approved rent increases during and these revenues are primarily dependent upon us receiving rental assistance subsidies from hud via monthly housing assistance payments hap payments 
the amount of each monthly hap payment is equal to the rent amount the contract rent stated in the hap contract with hud  less the amount payable by the eligible resident for such month 
other property revenues increased million in compared to primarily as a result of a refuse reimbursement program  which increased million  and water and sewer reimbursement program  which increased  the refuse reimbursement program was initiated in  while the water and sewer reimbursement program was changed from a flat fee charge to an allocation of actual costs program at the end of both programs provided increasing revenues during during their phase in period and then leveled off in late other property revenues increased million in compared to primarily as a result of fees received from hud in for service coordinator assistance made available to tenants at our affordable housing properties in the amount of  and increases in other ancillary revenues  such as the refuse reimbursement program  in the amount of  and leasing commissions received related to a managed commercial property in the amount of  below is a table setting forth the expiration dates of the hap contracts and the hap payments revenue recognized for our affordable housing properties as of december  in thousands final revenue recognized during property expiration date ellet december hillwood i july lakeshore village joint venture a july puritas place september st

the twelve wholly owned properties shown in the above table had positive cash flow during and are anticipated to have positive cash flow for the remaining contract terms 
therefore  none of these hap contracts are considered to be loss contracts 
lakeshore village had negative cash flow during as a result of increased operating expenditures related to utility expenses 
we intend to request a budget based increase in monthly hap payments sufficient to support a positive cash flow at this property 
we anticipate that additional cash requirements resulting from the negative cash flow  if any  will be funded by us and our joint venture partner 
such funding requirements are not expected to be material obligations 
contract rents may be adjusted at least annually in accordance with the annual adjustment factor method for some of the properties 
generally  these types of adjustments are only permitted if current rents are below the hud published fair market rent fmr threshold 
if current rents exceed fmrs  a rent comparability study must be completed to demonstrate that the property s rents are below market 
contract renewal request forms must be submitted to hud or its corresponding contract agent not less than days prior to the applicable hap anniversary date in order to renew an existing hap contract 
we understand that the following options are available to us for expiring hap contracts i for properties without mortgages  we may renew at current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor ocaf that is set by hud on an annual basis  ii for properties encumbered by a mortgage  we may renew at the lesser of x current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor or y comparable market rents  or  iii opt out of the section program 
opting out of the section program requires an additional one year notice to hud or the contract agent and the affected residents 
we believe  that upon expiration of the contracts  the contracts will be renewed  or we will enter into another government subsidized or mortgage restructuring program  or that the properties will be operated as conventional  market rate properties 
the following represents our current expectations concerning those hap contracts that expire in and shaker park gardens ii 
in april  we requested a renewal of the current contract for a one year term with an increase in rents of  as calculated using the ocaf published on august  our request for an ocaf increase was granted and the contract was renewed for a one year term through june  we intend to request a renewal in march for an additional one year period

fees  reimbursements and other 
the management and service operations recognized a reduction in both fee revenue and expense reimbursements during both comparison periods 
fee revenue decreased  in compared to and  in compared to these decreases were primarily due to the reduction in the number of properties that we manage for clients 
in  four managed properties were sold  one property was transferred to another advisor  and we purchased our joint venture partners share of one property 
disposition fees were recognized in related to two of these property sales 
in  four managed properties and two joint venture properties were sold 
management and advisory fees attributed to properties owned by advisory clients are earned pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable upon days notice 
reimbursements of expense from managed properties decreased during both comparison periods 
this reduction had no impact to the net loss from continuing operations as these reimbursements are also included in direct property management expenses 
painting service revenues and expenses 
painting service revenues and expenses both decreased in compared to and increased in compared to these changes are primarily a result of contracts that were entered into by our subsidiary  merit painting services in and work related to these contracts was completed during we anticipate that future contribution levels from merit painting services will be similar to the results for property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased when comparing to primarily as a result of real estate tax expense  utilities expense  and personnel expense 
the increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to assessed property value and millage rate increases that resulted in million in additional expense in and an ohio tax law change that resulted in an increase of approximately  in this law was signed june   and became effective july   retroactive to january  see ohio tax law changes for additional information

inflation 
it is our belief that the effects of inflation would be minimal on the operational performance of our portfolio primarily due to the high correlation between inflation and housing costs combined with the short term nature  typically one year  of the leases 
because of the high proportion of fixed rate debt compared to variable rate debt  we believe we have limited exposure to short term interest rate fluctuations 
critical accounting policies and estimate our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  the service companies and the operating partnership structured as a downreit 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  we estimate holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires us to reassess our contracts related to the future purchases of natural gas on a quarterly basis  to determine if they continue to be effective and that the forecasted transactions are probable 
in performing this analysis  we compare contracted volumes of gas to be delivered to actual volumes delivered and to estimated future volumes to be delivered based upon an analysis of previous natural gas usage 
if the contracts continue to be effective  the changes in fair value associated with the contracts are reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings until the related gas volumes are delivered 
should the actual amount of natural gas delivered be less than the estimated amount  it is possible that certain of the contracts could be considered ineffective 
such ineffectiveness could require us to report the changes in fair value in earnings that would otherwise have been reported in other comprehensive income 
it is possible that the change in fair value could materially impact our results of operations 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and that these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
replacements and improvements  such as hvac equipment  structural replacements  windows  appliances  flooring  carpeting and kitchen bath replacements and renovations are capitalized

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas sfas r which superceded the october issuance 
sfas r also supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule which amended the compliance dates for this statement 
accordingly  we will adopt this standard effective january  we are required to apply the provisions of this statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas as originally issued 
these grant date fair values had been included in the pro forma disclosures in the notes to the financial statements for periods prior to the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost will be recognized on all awards granted on or after the effective date over the related service period 
we may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for periods prior to the effective date are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures previously required for those periods 
upon adoption  we will not elect to adjust our financial statements for periods prior to the effective date 
based on our assessment of the additional compensation expense related to the adoption of this statement  we expect to recognize additional compensation expense of approximately  for the year ended december  related to awards that had been granted prior to december  awards granted after january   if any  would result in additional compensation expense during the year ended december  in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf regarding eitf  investor s accounting for an investment in a limited partnership when the investor is the sole general partner and the limited partners have certain rights 
the conclusion provides a framework for addressing the question of when a sole general partner  as defined in eitf  should consolidate a limited partnership 
the eitf has concluded that the general partner of a limited partnership should consolidate a limited partnership  unless the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause  or b substantive participating rights 
in addition  the eitf concluded that the guidance should be expanded to include all limited partnerships  including those with multiple general partners 
we will adopt eitf as of january  we have assessed our investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and have determined that eitf will not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate mortgage debt 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
management uses various financial models and advisors to assist them in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives 
from time to time  we may enter into hedge agreements to minimize its exposure to interest rate risks

natural gas market price risk 
we purchase significant volumes of natural gas which is used to heat certain of our properties and as such we are exposed to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
we utilize forward contracts with respect to forecasted probable purchases of gas to limit our exposure to price increases 
additionally  we utilize forward contracts and reverse forward contracts with respect to expected future natural gas purchases related to certain properties that we manage 
through the use of these contracts  we attempt to minimize the risk of increasing future gas prices 
however  should gas prices decrease in the future  it is possible that we could pay more for the contracted gas purchases than we would have paid had we not utilized the forward contracts 
for additional information related to these contracts  see derivative instruments and hedging activities in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k

we have reviewed tangible long lived assets and other agreements for associated asset retirement obligations aros  in accordance with fasb statement no

future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted
