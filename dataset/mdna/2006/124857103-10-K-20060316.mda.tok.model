the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated million at december  and are not recorded on the balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
accounting for the production and distribution of television programming is in accordance with sop  which requires management s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program 
these judgments are used to determine the amortization ii management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tabular dollars in millions  except per share amounts of capitalized production costs  expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit or intangible assets could result in an impairment under sfas and a non cash charge would be required 
balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to legal issues  restructuring charges and discontinued businesses  including asbestos and environmental matters  require significant judgments and estimates by management 
the company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates 
while management believes that the current reserves for matters related to historical and predecessor operations of the company  including environmental and asbestos are adequate  there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods 
pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions 
two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
the company determined the discount rate by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation 
those projected benefit payments are used to construct a high quality bond portfolio with interest and principal payments that provide the cash flows necessary to meet the projected benefit payments 
the projected benefit payments are discounted by the weighted average yield of the bond portfolio 
the expected long term returns on plan assets were based upon the target asset allocation and return estimates for equity and debt securities 
the expected rate of return for equities was based upon the risk free rate plus a premium for equity securities 
the expected return on debt securities was based upon an analysis of current and historical yields on portfolios of similar quality and duration 
for  the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension increased principally as a result of change in mortality rate assumption and lower than expected returns from plan assets 
a decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense 
the estimated impact of a basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately million on pension expense and will change the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the estimated impact of a basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately million in pension expense 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
the company is continually audited by us federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes that its tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
an estimated ii management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tabular dollars in millions  except per share amounts effective tax rate for a year is applied to quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter 
a number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters  for which a reserve has been established  is audited and finally resolved 
during  the company recognized million of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain prior year tax audits 
legal matters shareholder derivative lawsuits and demands 
two shareholder derivative lawsuits  consolidated as in re viacom shareholders derivative litigation  were filed in july in new york state supreme court relating to executive compensation and alleged corporate waste 
the actions name each member of former viacom s board of directors  messrs 
tom freston and leslie moonves each of whom were executive officers of former viacom  and  as a nominal defendant  former viacom  alleging that the compensation of messrs 
redstone  freston  and moonves was excessive and unwarranted and challenging the independence of certain former viacom directors 
mr 
redstone is the company s executive chairman of the board of directors and founder and mr 
moonves is the company s president and chief executive officer 
mr 
freston is new viacom s president and chief executive officer 
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages from the members of the former viacom board of directors for their alleged breach of fiduciary duties  disgorgement of the compensation paid to the officers of former viacom  equitable relief  and attorney fees and expenses 
the company moved to dismiss the complaints and oral argument was heard on february  no decision has been issued by the court 
any liabilities in this matter adverse to the company and or new viacom will be shared equally between the company and new viacom 
the company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these actions are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation 
the company has received shareholder demands seeking access to books and records of the company relating to executive compensation paid to sumner m 
redstone  tom freston and leslie moonves  accompanied by statements that such demands are in furtherance of an investigation of possible mismanagement  self dealing and corporate waste by directors and officers of former viacom 
another shareholder demand seeking access to books and records relates to the compensation of sumner m 
redstone and mel karmazin former chief operating officer of former viacom 
one of the demands also seeks access to books and records of the company relating to sumner m 
redstone s acquisition of a controlling interest in midway games inc the company intends to comply with all reasonable requests 
under the separation agreement between the company and new viacom  liabilities in connection with executive compensation claims relating to officers of former viacom are shared equally by the company and new viacom 
claims related to former businesses asbestos  environmental and other 
the company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials  which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by westinghouse  a predecessor  generally prior to the early s 
westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos 
the company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases 
in the majority of asbestos lawsuits  the plaintiffs have not identified which of the company s products is the basis of a claim 
claims against the company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation  industrial and marine use  or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta  a laminate used in commercial ships 
ii management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tabular dollars in millions  except per share amounts claims are frequently filed and or settled in large groups  which may make the amount and timing of settlements  and the number of pending claims  subject to significant fluctuation from period to period 
the company does not report as pending those claims on inactive  stayed  deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment 
as of december   the company had pending approximately  asbestos claims  as compared with approximately  as of december  and approximately  as of december  of the claims pending as of december   approximately  were pending in state courts   in federal courts and approximately  were third party claims 
during  the company received approximately  new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately  claims 
the company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement 
settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim  the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors 
to date  the company has not been liable for any third party claims 
the company s total costs for the years and for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses 
filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma  a rare cancer  the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos  lung cancer  a cancer which may be caused by various factors  one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure  other cancers  and conditions that are substantially less serious  including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease 
claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims pending at december  in a substantial number of the pending claims  the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury 
the company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities 
the company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the company 
in addition  the company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims other than asbestos arising from historical operations of the company and its predecessors 
on an ongoing basis  the company defends itself in a multitude of lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal  state and local authorities collectively  litigation 
litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict 
however  based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances  the company believes that the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely  in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
under the separation agreement between the company and new viacom  new viacom has agreed to defend and indemnify cbs corp 
in certain litigation in which cbs corp 
is named 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in accordance with its policy  the company does not use ii management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition tabular dollars in millions  except per share amounts derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore  the company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
foreign exchange risk the company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the united states  resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the us dollar 
in order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the british pound  the euro  the canadian dollar  the mexican peso and the australian dollar foreign currency forward and option contracts are used 
additionally  the company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges  and may designate certain forward contracts as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
the change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period results as part of other items  net 
the company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally 
at december   the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was million which represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency cash flows 
at december   the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was million  of which million related to the hedging of future productions costs

interest rate risk all of the company s long term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements 
the company has entered into fixed to floating rate swap agreements for a portion of this debt  which are designated as fair value hedges 
these swaps expose the company to movements in short term interest rates 
based on the amount of fixed to floating rate swaps and receivable securitization programs outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would cause a change to pre tax earnings 
as of december   if all parties were to agree  the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the company of approximately million including accrued interest
