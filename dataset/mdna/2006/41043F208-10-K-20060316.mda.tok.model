item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview the following is a discussion of our results of operations and financial position for the periods described below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future results 
these statements are based on certain assumptions that we consider reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
we are the largest owner and operator of orthotic and prosthetic o p patient care centers in the united states 
through our subsidiary  southern prosthetics supply  inc sps  we are also the largest distributor of branded and private label o p devices and components in the united states  all of which are manufactured by third parties 
we also create products  through our subsidiary innovative neurotronics  inc in  inc  for sale in our patient care centers and through a sales force 
the first such product will be available for sale in the first half of for patients who have had a loss of mobility due to strokes  multiple sclerosis or other similar conditions 
another subsidiary  linkia llc linkia  develops programs to manage all aspects of o p patient care for large private payors 
patient care we are the largest operator and developer of orthotic and prosthetic o p patient care centers in the united states 
orthotics is the design  fabrication  fitting and device maintenance of custom made braces and other devices such as spinal  knee and sports medicine braces that provide external support to treat musculoskeletal disorders 
musculoskeletal disorders are ailments of the back  extremities or joints caused by traumatic injuries  chronic conditions  diseases  congenital disorders or injuries resulting from sports or other activities 
prosthetics is the design  fabrication and fitting of custom made artificial limbs for patients who have lost limbs as a result of traumatic injuries  vascular diseases  diabetes  cancer or congenital disorders 
the patient care services segment generated of our net sales in our patient care centers are located in states and the district of columbia  with a substantial presence in california  florida  ohio  pennsylvania  georgia  arizona  new york  illinois and texas 
we operated and patient care centers at december  and  respectively 
we generate sales primarily from patient care services related to the fabrication  fitting and maintenance of o p devices 
the increase or decrease in our same center sales growth represents the aggregate change in our patient care centers sales in the current fiscal year compared to the preceding fiscal year 
patient care centers that have been owned by the company for at least one full year are included in the computation 
during and  same center sales increased by and decreased by  respectively  compared to the preceding year 
net sales increased million in as a result of million in same store sales growth and million from acquired practices 
same store sales increased despite continued reimbursement pressure due to continued focus by a dedicated sales team  the introduction of new products and services and increased volume from national payors 
our revenues and results of operations are affected by seasonal considerations 
the adverse weather conditions often experienced in certain geographical areas of the united states during the first calendar quarter of each year  together with a greater degree of patients sole responsibility for their insurance deductible payment obligations during the beginning of each calendar year  have generally contributed to lower net sales and profits in the first quarter 
distribution sps  our distribution segment  is the largest distributor of o p devices in the united states 
sps had net sales of million in with million  or  made to non hanger patient care centers 
sps external sales increased million  or  over the prior year as a result of increased sales volume in its existing customer base  an addition of approximately new accounts and the rollout of its updated product catalogue containing expanded product offerings 
sps has three distribution centers strategically located in the united states 
sps is able to deliver virtually any order within hours of receipt 
the ability to quickly deliver orders allows us to maintain much lower levels of inventory in our patient care centers and to provide enhanced service levels to our external customers 
products our new subsidiary  in  inc  is focused on introducing emerging myo orthotic products to the o p market 
in  inc s first product  the walkaide system  is designed to improve the mobility of stroke patients 
during  we received fda and other regulatory approvals for the walkaide system 
we will begin to market and sell the walkaide system during the first half of since inception  we have incurred and expensed million of start up costs associated with in  inc provider network management our subsidiary  linkia  provides o p provider network management services to regional and national insurance carriers 
during the second half of  linkia entered into a contract with cigna healthcare to manage cigna s o p network 
linkia will continue to implement the cigna contract through the first half of with the anticipation of an increase in net sales in the second half of during  our patient care centers experienced increased patient volume as a result of linkia s contracts  a trend we expect to continue through results and outlook net income from operations  although higher than prior year  did not meet management s expectations principally due to lower than expected sales growth in our patient care centers  which was offset by higher than expected sales of the distribution segment 
the patient care segment continues to be affected by reimbursement pressure  including a freeze on government reimbursement through december   which we continue to counter through an effort to control operating costs 
our net income was also impacted by our continued investment in in  inc and linkia  which totaled million in day s sales outstanding dso  which is the number of days between the billing for our o p services and the date of our receipt of payment for the year ended december  decreased to days from days for the prior year 
the decrease in dso is due to an increased effort at the patient care centers to target collections as well as the implementation of electronic billing and other workflow enhancements 
we expect results to show a slight increase as we go through the last year of the medicare freeze 
we expect to see an increase in our sales volume over the next year as a result of the reimbursement contracts entered into by linkia  sales from in  inc s new product and increased sales from our distribution segment 
we will also continue our efforts to counter the cyclical trends and challenges present in our market by undertaking several specific initiatives the inclusion of large regional insurance carriers in linkia s customer base  the utilization of our centralized billing system  ops  to analyze related o p procedures in an effort to provide comprehensive services  increasing the number of lower extremity evaluation clinics  which focus on bringing in patients for regular checkups  the use of our insignia laser scanning system for other than prosthetics fittings  such as burn garments and cranial helmets  the rollout of the people in motion program  which introduces potential patients to new o p technology  the rollout of totalcare  a program designed to provide comprehensive o p services to our patients  the introduction of new products by entering into exclusive distribution contracts with o p product manufacturers  and continuing discussions with rehabilitation providers to enable us to provide more comprehensive o p services 
critical accounting policies and estimates our analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we have chosen accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note b to the consolidated financial statements as presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices and associated services to patients are recorded when the device is accepted by the patient  provided that i delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues on the sale of orthotic and prosthetic devices to customers by our distribution segment are recorded upon the shipment of products  in accordance with the terms of the invoice  net of merchandise returns received and the amount established for anticipated returns 
discounted sales are recorded at net realizable value 
deferred revenue represents prepaid tuition and fees received from students enrolled in our practitioner education program 
revenue at our patient care centers segment is recorded net of all governmental adjustments  contractual adjustments and discounts 
we employ a systematic process to ensure that our sales are recorded at net realizable value and that any required adjustments are recorded on a timely basis 
the contracting module of our centralized  computerized billing system is designed to record revenue at net realizable value based on our contract with the patient s insurance company 
updated billing information is received periodically from payors and is uploaded into our centralized contract module and then disseminated to all patient care centers electronically 
the following represents the composition of our patient care segment s accounts receivable balance by payor at december  in thousands commercial  private pay and other  medicaid  medicare  va  we completed the rollout of ops in the second quarter of  prior to which we were unable to develop reports to determine the composition of our accounts receivable by payor 
additionally  we will endeavor to develop reports to determine the composition of our allowance for doubtful accounts by payor 
the composition of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts by payor will not be comparable until the third quarter of disallowed sales generally relate to billings to payors with whom we do not have a formal contract 
in these situations we record the sale at usual and customary rates and simultaneously record a disallowed sale to reduce the sale to net value  based on our historical experience with the payor in question 
disallowed sales may also result if the payor rejects or adjusts certain billing codes 
billing codes are frequently updated within our industry 
as soon as updates are received  we reflect the change in our centralized billing system 
as part of our preauthorization process with payors  we validate our ability to bill the payor for the service we are providing before we deliver the device 
subsequent to billing for our devices and services  there may be problems with pre authorization or with other insurance coverage issues with payors 
if there has been a lapse in coverage  the patient is financially responsible for the charges related to the devices and services received 
if we do not collect from the patient  we record bad debt expense 
occasionally  a portion of a bill is rejected by a payor due to a coding error on our part and we are prevented from pursuing payment from the patient due to the terms of our contract with the insurance company 
we appeal these types of decisions and are generally successful 
this activity is factored into our methodology to determine the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we immediately record  as a reduction of sales  a disallowed sale for any claims that we know we will not recover and adjust our future estimates accordingly 
certain accounts receivable may be uncollectible  even if properly pre authorized and billed 
regardless of the balance  accounts receivable amounts are periodically evaluated to assess collectibility 
in addition to the actual bad debt expense recognized during collection activities  we estimate the amount of potential bad debt expense that may occur in the future 
this estimate is based upon our historical experience as well as a review of our receivable balances 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate cash collections  accounts receivable balances and write off activity to assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  a company wide evaluation of collectibility of receivable balances older than days is performed at least semi annually  the results of which are used in the next allowance analysis 
in these detailed reviews  the account s net realizable value is estimated after considering the customer s payment history  past efforts to collect on the balance and the outstanding balance  and a specific reserve is recorded if needed 
from time to time  the company may outsource the collection of such accounts to outsourced agencies after internal collection efforts are exhausted 
in the cases when valid accounts receivable cannot be collected  the uncollectible account is written off to bad debt expense 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
at our patient care centers segment  we calculate cost of goods sold in accordance with the gross profit method for all reporting periods 
we base the estimates used in applying the gross profit method on the actual results of the most recently completed fiscal year and other factors  such as sales mix and purchasing trends among other factors  affecting cost of goods sold during the current reporting periods 
estimated cost of goods sold during the period is adjusted when the annual physical inventory is taken 
we treat these adjustments as changes in accounting estimates 
at our distribution segment  a perpetual inventory is maintained 
management adjusts our reserve for inventory obsolescence whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying cost of certain inventory items is in excess of its market price 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at cost 
equipment acquired under capital leases is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of the future lease payments 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold  retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the respective accounts  and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows furniture and fixtures years machinery and equipment years computers and software years buildings to years assets under capital leases shorter of asset life or term of lease leasehold improvements shorter of asset life or term of lease we capitalize internally developed computer software costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
goodwill and other intangible assets excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to net identifiable assets of purchased businesses 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting units may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  annually 
any impairment would be recognized by a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
our annual impairment test utilizes income  market and cost approaches in determining the value of our reporting units 
as of october   our test did not result in an impairment charge 
non compete agreements are recorded based on agreements entered into by us and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their terms ranging from five to seven years 
other definite lived intangible assets are recorded at cost and are amortized  using the straight line method  over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
whenever the facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these intangibles may not be recoverable  management reviews and assesses the future cash flows expected to be generated from the related intangible for possible impairment 
any impairment would be recognized as a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
deferred tax assets liabilities we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial accounting purposes than for income tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets or liabilities are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
we recognize deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not the assets will be realized in future years 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance  which will continually be assessed 
after having determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance may be reversed  resulting in a benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is accounted for using the intrinsic value based method 
no stock based employee compensation expense for stock options is reflected in net income as all options granted under our stock based employee compensation plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as it pertains to restricted shares of common stock issued to our directors and certain employees  we recognize the fair value of those shares at the date of grant as unearned compensation and amortize such amount to compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of each grant 
supplemental executive retirement plan 
benefit costs and liabilities balances are calculated based on certain assumptions including benefits earned  discount rates  interest costs  mortality rates and other factors 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  affecting the recorded obligation and expense in future periods 
the following assumptions were used in the calculation of the net benefit cost and obligation at december discount rate average rate of increase in compensation the discount rate at december  of represents a basis point reduction from the discount rate used at december  the updated rate was actuarially determined and represents an average of benefit liability indices 
we believe the assumptions used are appropriate  however  changes in assumptions or differences in actual experience may affect our benefit obligation and future expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   requires abnormal balances of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage to be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether such costs meet the criterion of so abnormal as defined in arb in addition  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to conversion costs be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted sfas on january  and anticipate this will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  supersedes the accounting principles board s opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
although the methodology of accounting for share based payments in sfas r is similar to that under sfas  sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees  including stock option grants  be recognized at fair value in the statement of operations 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method allowed for in sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense related to awards granted prior to and not vested as of the adoption of sfas r is calculated in accordance with sfas and recognized in the statements of operations over the requisite remaining service period  compensation expense for all awards granted after the adoption of sfas r is recognized according to the provision of sfas r 
given our recent trend of compensating certain of our employees with restricted shares of common stock instead of options  and in anticipation of the implementation of sfas r  during the second quarter of  we accelerated the vesting of million non director stock options which had a grant price in excess of the market value of the underlying common stock 
these options had grant prices ranging from to and vesting periods through january we do not anticipate that the remaining director options will have a significant effect on the financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
this pronouncement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas  changes to accounting principles require retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless such effect is impracticable to determine 
additionally  sfas requires changes in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets to be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
we adopted sfas on january  and do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our financial statements
