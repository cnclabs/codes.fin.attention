item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information about the corporation  see selected statistical information on pages of this report on form k 
overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county 
we have four full service banking facilities and six automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market through acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
we operate in a region of southwest georgia that is tended to have slower economic growth than the northern parts of the state 
however  we have had an influx of new business that support the growing poultry business in our area 
the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans  securities and federal funds sold  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
during  the us economy was marked by consistently rising interest rates 
in  the federal reserve bank increased short term interest rates and since july  short term rates increased thirteen times  or by year end 
our profitability is impacted as well by operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  demographics of the population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
in addition  broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which is outside of our control 
as a result of our strategy to diversify revenue  noninterest income has grown over the last few years and was of net interest income 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  trust and retail brokerage services 
in  we continued to make improvements in asset quality following significant improvements made with respect to overall asset quality in and during the second quarter of  we sold a large foreclosed property with a loss on sale of approximately  during the second quarter of  the corporation made the decision to transfer the colquitt retirement inn  the corporation s largest nonperforming asset  for  to the georgia trust for historic preservation 
as a result  non performing assets to total assets declined from at december   to at the end of  at the end of and at the end of on february   the corporation acquired first bank holding company and its bank subsidiary  sylvester banking company  for million in cash and  shares of southwest georgia financial corporation common stock valued at million 
sylvester banking company was merged into southwest georgia bank 
sylvester banking company  which has been in business since  at the time of the acquisition had million in assets 
the business combination was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of sylvester banking company since the date of acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements 
total assets of million and liabilities of million were booked at fair value including a core deposit intangible of million 
this core deposit intangible is being amortized over a year period

critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate  however  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary net income for was million  an increase of approximately million  or  when compared with million in higher net income in was primarily due to solid operating results for the mortgage banking subsidiary and strong expense control 
mortgage banking revenues increased  or  over s results 
expenses relating to equipment  data processing  amortization of intangible assets  and other operating declined  or  for compared with on a per share basis  net income for was per diluted share compared with per diluted share for because of our strong capital condition  we continued through the stock repurchase program that began in january in   shares were repurchased 
through the end of  a total of  shares have been repurchased since the beginning of the program 
the share repurchase program was extended by the board of directors at their meeting in january through the end of january the corporation is authorized to purchase an additional  shares under the plan 
net income for was million  an increase of approximately million  or  when compared with million in higher net income in was primarily due to the million after tax charge in the second quarter of for the transfer of a non performing asset  the colquitt retirement inn 
excluding the charge associated with the non performing asset in  earnings improved 
other major factors contributing to the improvement in earnings included increases of  in insurance services income   in mortgage banking services income   in service charge on deposit accounts  and a  decrease in the provision for loan losses 
the majority of the increase in net interest income and non interest expenses was related to the operations of the acquired bank 
we measure our performance on selected key ratios  which are provided for the last three years in the following table return on average total assets return on average shareholders equity average shareholders equity to average total assets net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income net interest income for decreased  or  compared with the decrease was influenced by the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and higher funding costs 
interest income from earning assets increased  or  in compared with  while interest expenses increased million  or  for the same period 
the majority of the  increase in interest income for the year resulted from increased volumes in earning assets related to the acquisition 
average investment volumes increased million  or  in compared with while the average yield decreased basis points 
average loan volumes increased million during  with a yield increase of basis points to resulted in an increase in interest income from loans of  the increase of million of interest expense in compared with primarily resulted from a basis point increase in the average rate paid on time deposits and basis points increase in the average rate paid on savings deposits 
the volume of average time deposits decreased million  or  was offset by an increase in average long term debt of million 
during  average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  with the majority of the increase  or million  in lower rate savings accounts while average certificates of deposit decreased million  or 
average non interest bearing deposits increased million or 
interest expense on deposits continues to closely follow interest rate trends 
net interest income for increased  or  compared with interest income from earning assets increased  or  in compared with  while interest expenses increased  or  for the same period 
the majority of the  increase in interest income for the year resulted from increased volumes in earning assets related to the acquisition 
average loan volume increased million  or  in compared with while the average yield decreased basis points 
the increase of  of interest expense in compared with primarily resulted from a growth in deposits and other borrowings 
the deposit mix changed slightly due to the lower rate environment causing a shift from time to savings deposits 
net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin was for  a basis point decrease from in the net interest margin in was down basis points compared with the net interest margin of in our net interest margin decline is primarily due to higher funding costs and to lower yields on earning assets acquired with the sylvester banking company acquisition and our investment portfolio as a result of the flattening yield curve 
the increased rates on short term borrowing driven by the rise in the federal reserve discount rate since june of has also impacted net interest income by driving interest rates on deposits higher 
noninterest income noninterest income is an important contributor to net earnings 
the largest single component of the corporation s noninterest income in recent years has been mortgage banking services fees 
the following table summarizes the changes in noninterest income during the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount change service charges on deposit accounts    income from trust services income from retail brokerage services income from insurance services    income from mortgage banking services    gain loss on the sale or abandonment of assets  gain loss on the sale of securities other income total noninterest income    less than noninterest income in increased million compared with mortgage banking income increased  as loan origination fees on commercial mortgages increased over the prior year 
the mortgage banking servicing portfolio is comprised of non recourse loans which we service for participating commercial mortgage lenders 
at december   empire was servicing approximately million in loans 
service charges on deposit accounts  income from trust services  and income from insurance services leveled off in gain on sale or abandonment of assets increased  resulting primarily from losses on sales of foreclosed properties in excluding the loss on the sale or abandonment of assets in and  noninterest income increased  in compared with the majority of the loss on sale of assets in related to the million charge and transfer of our major nonperforming asset the colquitt retirement inn to the georgia trust for historic preservation 
service charges on deposit accounts increased due to the addition of the acquired branch office and the overdraft protection program 
increases in fees from trust activities  insurance services  and mortgage banking services more than offset the decrease in income from security sales 
noninterest expense noninterest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
the following table summarizes the changes in the noninterest expenses for the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount change salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense equipment expense data processing expense amortization of intangible assets other operating expense    total noninterest expense    total noninterest expense increased thousand  or  in compared with salaries and employee benefits expense increased due to incentive based compensation at the mortgage banking subsidiary  increased pension contributions and increased staffing to replace near term retirees 
the company s employees totaled at december  compared with the prior year end 
occupancy expense increased  or in compared to this was primarily due to increased depreciation expense from a building renovation project completed in late the other noninterest expense categories equipment  data processing  amortization of intangible assets  and other operating expenses declined from the previous year due to incurring higher expenses related to the acquisition of sylvester banking company in in compared with  total noninterest expense increased million  or primarily as a result of the corporation s acquisition of sylvester banking company 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased due to an increase in full time equivalent employees of to a total of at december  compared with the prior year end 
amortization of intangible assets increased  in compared with the previous year 
this increase resulted from the amortization of core deposit premiums related to the purchase of sylvester banking company 
the efficiency ratio noninterest expenses divided by total noninterest income plus net interest income  a measure of productivity  improved to for  from for and for federal income tax expense the corporation expensed million  million and million for federal income taxes for the years ending december   and  respectively 
these amounts resulted in an effective tax rate of   and for   and  respectively 
see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of tax expense 
uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets increased million  or  to million 
the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  deposits at the federal home loan bank  and federal funds sold averaged million in  a increase over million in this increase was the result of the acquisition of sylvester banking company 
the earning asset mix remained relatively stable during the year 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and federal funds sold and funds at the federal home loan bank 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets slightly decreased to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation s largest earning assets and users of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio 
during  average loans represented of average earning assets and of average total assets 
the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio at december    and was as follows dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount change real estate construction    real estate commercial mortgage    real estate residential    real estate agricultural    commercial  financial  and agricultural loans    consumer loans    total loans    average total loans increased in due to an increase in local loan demand mainly in construction and commercial loans 
we continued to apply stringent credit criteria on all loan applications 
the ratio of total loans to total deposits at year end increased to in compared with in the loan portfolio mix at year end consisted of loans secured by construction real estate  loans secured by commercial real estate  of loans secured by residential real estate  and of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the loan portfolio also included other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes and loans to individuals for consumer purposes 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible  are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a  decrease from the corresponding year end amount which was of total loans outstanding 
the provision for loan losses was  in  a  decrease from the prior year s provision 
this provision reflected our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb possible losses in the loan portfolio 
see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities consist primarily of us government agency securities 
the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income  to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with staggered maturities ranging from one to five years 
the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities as of december  dollars in thousands securities securities amounts maturing in available for sale held to maturity one year or less   after one through five years   after five through ten years   after ten years  equity mortgage backed securities  total investment securities   the total investment portfolio decreased to million from million at year end compared with year end  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was due to maturing and called us government agency securities and to an increase in loan demand 
the average total investment portfolio increased to million in compared with million for we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets decreased million at year end compared with year end this decrease primarily resulted from a reduction in non accruing loans due to overall improvement in loan quality 
nonperforming assets were approximately  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits increased compared with from million to million 
the majority of the increase in average deposits occurred in average savings and now account deposits 
competitive interest rates during resulted in a slight change in the deposit mix 
some customers shifted money from certificates of deposit to savings  money market  and now accounts due to lower rates paid on time certificates of deposit 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit of  or more each 
this was a decrease over the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation repaid short term advances with the federal home loan bank of million leaving million to be paid in august also  in the corporation borrowed an additional million in long term advances from the federal home loan bank 
the advance has a fixed rate for years with a maturity in with the lender having an option to convert the advance to a variable rate after the fixed rate period 
total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  details on the federal home bank advances are presented in note to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  from loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation s cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating and investing activities generated cash flows of million  while financing activities used million of this and decreased the cash and due from banks balances by million 
cash produced from operations continues to provide cash for the payment of dividends and common stock repurchases 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits increased to of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash which is received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments which can be easily be converted to cash without significant loss 
the corporation s investment securities maturing within one year or less were million on december   which represented of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation had million of investment securities callable at the option of the issuer and that are reasonably likely to be called during these maturing and callable investment securities are sources for repayment of our short term and long term debt obligations 
we are not aware of any known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and its scheduled future cash payments under those commitments as of december  the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations were long term debt 
the remaining contractual obligations were comprised of telephone operating leases and purchase obligations for data processing services with our primary service bureau 
we have no capital lease obligations 
contractual payments due by period obligations less dollars in thousands than after total year years years years long term debt   operating leases total contractual obligations   off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers and to reduce risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual or notional amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit the corporation does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
capital resources and dividends we continue to maintain a healthy level of capital adequacy as measured by our average equity to average assets ratio of in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio in tandem with the risk based ratios 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate movements 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio that staggers maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity 
the table below provides information about the corporation s financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for each rate sensitive asset and liability listed  the table presents principal balances and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity or the earliest possible repricing opportunity dates 
one of the indicators for our interest rate sensitivity position is the measurement of the difference between its rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which is referred to as the gap 
a gap analysis displays the earliest possible repricing opportunity for each asset and liability category based upon contractual maturities and repricing 
at year end  our sensitivity ratio  or one year cumulative rate sensitive assets relative to cumulative rate sensitive liabilities  was compared with for this change in the sensitivity ratio was a result of the corporation s management of its exposure to interest rate risk 
we are liability sensitive at the one year gap position because we had purchased in primarily five year investment securities with a year or less of call protection 
these securities were repositioned in the gap analysis after their first call date because they were not called 
the effect of this reposition shows that the corporation is liability sensitive at the one year gap position 
this liability sensitive position will increase the corporation s exposure to rising interest rates 
all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same pace  therefore  the sensitivity ratio is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
we monitor our asset and liability mix in an effort to ensure that the effects of interest rate movements in either direction are not significant over time
