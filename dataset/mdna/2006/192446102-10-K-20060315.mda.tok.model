excluding this one time tax benefit  net income increased to million or per diluted share in the key drivers of our revenue growth in were as follows strong performance of our financial services and healthcare segments 
our financial services segment had revenue growth of approximately in and our healthcare segment had revenue growth of approximately in expansion of our service offerings  which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions  and increased penetration at existing customers  including strategic customers 
specifically  of our revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of during  we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of it solutions  particularly high performance web development initiatives  complex systems development engagements  testing  customer relationship management crm  enterprise resource planning erp  data warehousing and business intelligence 
we finished the year with approximately active clients compared to in and added strategic clients in bring the total number of our strategic clients to we define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between million and million or more in annual revenues at maturity 
our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues in as compared approximately and  respectively  for the year ended december  as we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers  we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline in future periods 
in europe  we continue to see growth in the uk market and we are starting to see signs of increased demand in continental europe 
our revenue from european customers increased by approximately in to million compared to million in in  revenue from continental europe increased by approximately million or approximately from approximately million in to approximately million in continental europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in as we see this area as a growth opportunity for the long term

table of contents in  our operating margin increased to approximately compared to in this was consistent with our historic targeted operating margin range of to of total revenues 
historically  we have invested the profitability above the to operating margin level back into our business  which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth 
this investment is primarily focused in the areas of i hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise  ii training our technical staff in a broader range of it service offerings  iii strengthening our business analytic capabilities  iv strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services and v continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery 
in addition  we maintain a deep bench of resources  trained in a broad range of service offerings  in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects 
this also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels 
we finished the year with total headcount of approximately  an increase of approximately  over the prior year end 
the increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs  to meet the demand for our services  are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in turnover  including both voluntary and involuntary  was approximately for the vast majority of our turnover occurs in india  resulting in on site annualized attrition rates below the global rate 
in addition  attrition is weighted toward the most junior members of our staff 
we are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as way of reducing overall operating costs 
we recently expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned development centers to now include over million square feet as compared to previous plans  announced in october to add  square feet of space 
the million square feet of facilities will be located in chennai  pune  kolkata  hyderabad and bangalore  india 
the total construction expenditure related to this expanded program is estimated to the approximately million an increase of approximately million when compared to the expansion program announced in october  which we expect to fund primarily from current operations 
in april  we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of fathom solutions  llc fathom  a united states based company specializing in it consulting in the telecommunications and financial services industries  for initial consideration of approximately million in cash and stock 
additional purchase price  not to exceed million  payable in  is contingent on fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended april  and will be recorded when the contingency is resolved 
we completed this acquisition primarily to strengthen our service capabilities in the telecommunications industry 
we will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry

table of contents on january   we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs 
we expect the adoption of sfas r to reduce net income in by an amount slightly above the sfas no 
pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately million for factors that will affect our estimate of the sfas r expense for include the timing and geographic mix of option grants  and changes to our stock price  volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates during the year in critical accounting estimates and risks management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  for certain fixed bid contracts  the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting  under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost cost to cost method 
estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer  historical collections experience and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance  if any  involves judgment 
as a global company  we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
in the period of resolution  adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income  as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate 
on an on going basis  we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized in the period such determination was made 
our indian subsidiary  cognizant india  is an export oriented company  which  under the indian income tax act of  is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each software technology park stp with respect to export profits for each stp 
substantially all of the earnings of cognizant india are attributable to export profits 
in  the ten year tax holiday expired for one stp and  accordingly  the export profits for that stp are subject to indian income tax 
export profits from the remaining stps in india are currently entitled to a exemption from indian income tax 
under current law  these tax holidays will be completely phased out by march of the tax holiday did not expire for any stps in on march   the tax holiday will expire for an additional stp  however  we do not expect the incremental indian taxes due on the operating profits of this stp to have a significant effect on our effective income tax rate as we anticipate the percentage of indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in india will increase as a percentage of total indian earnings in in anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in march  we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones sez 
development centers operating in sez will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to years 
under current indian tax law  export profits after march  from our existing stps will be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate currently in effect at such time 
prior to  it was management s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states  accordingly  we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through december  during the first quarter of  we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia 
as a component of this strategy  beginning in  we intend to use indian earnings to expand operations outside of the 
table of contents us instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states 
accordingly  effective january   pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 we no longer accrue incremental united states taxes on indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us as of december   the amount of unrepatriated indian earnings and total foreign earnings  including unrepatriated indian earnings  upon which no incremental us taxes has been recorded is approximately million and million  respectively 
if such post earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future  it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on indian earnings recognized prior to would require adjustment 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  or as circumstances warrant 
when determining the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
as of december   our goodwill balance was approximately million 
long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset 
if such assets were determined to be impaired  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks 
most of our it development centers  including a majority of our employees  are located in india 
as a result  we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations  including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions 
additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs  quotas and other barriers 
we are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us  including  but not limited to  a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline

although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts  errors  mistakes  or omissions in rendering our application design  development and maintenance services  there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
although we have general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions  there 
table of contents can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results  financial position and cash flows 
in connection with our split off from ims health  we entered into a distribution agreement  dated january   with ims health  referred to as the distribution agreement 
the distribution agreement provides  among other things  that ims health and we will comply with  and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with  the representations made to and relied upon by mcdermott  will emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the united states federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer 
in addition  pursuant to the distribution agreement  we indemnified ims health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by mcdermott  will emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the united states federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer

exit activity on june   we announced our plans to wind down operations at our development center located in limerick  ireland and close the facility by march  as of march   we completed the wind down of our limerick development facility 
during the year ended december   we recorded expenses of approximately million primarily for severance  retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of million through december  during the year ended december   we recorded additional expenses of approximately million and made payments of approximately million primarily for severance and retention bonuses 
all costs have been paid as of december  foreign currency translation overall  we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately of our revenues are generated from customers located in the united states 
however  a portion of our costs in india are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which has an impact on our results of operations 
in addition  a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses 
on an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the indian rupee in our indian subsidiary 

table of contents related party transactions on february  the split off date  ims health distributed all of our class b common stock that ims health owned in an exchange offer to ims health stockholders the split off 
in connection with the exchange offer we incurred split off costs of million in as a result of the split off  ims health is no longer a related party as of the split off date 
accordingly  our revenues from ims health subsequent to the split off date are classified as third party revenues 
we recognized related party revenues from ims health totaling approximately million in total revenues from ims health during  including related party revenues prior to the split off date  were approximately million 
effects of inflation our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals 
competition in india  the united states and europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation 
as with other it service providers  we must adequately anticipate wage increases  particularly on our fixed price contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the united states and elsewhere

 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods 
table of contents after adoption 
total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
sfas no 
r is effective for our annual reporting period beginning january  we will adopt sfas no 
r effective january   utilizing the modified prospective method 
adoption of sfas no 
r will reduce our gross margin  operating margin  reported net income and earnings per share because we currently use the intrinsic value method as permitted by apb no 
accordingly  no compensation expense is currently recognized for stock purchase rights granted under our i employee stock option plans since the exercise price equals the fair value of the underlying stock at date of grant and ii employee stock purchase plan 
for the year ended december   we expect the annualized after tax cost associated with expensing grants under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  including an estimate of grants to be issued in  to be slightly above the sfas no 
pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately million for factors that will affect our estimate of the sfas r expense for include the timing and geographic mix of option grants  and changes to our stock price  volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates during the year in forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended that involve risks and uncertainties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies  particularly the indian rupee 
accordingly  we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
during july  we entered into a foreign currency forward contract  with a six month term and notional amount of million  to sell the indian rupee for united states dollars that was settled in january we may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or 
table of contents depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies 
other than the aforementioned forward contract  we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 
we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates 
we limit our credit risk by investing primarily aaa rated securities as rated by moody s  standard poor s and fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer
