the company s maximum aggregate liability for such unknown environmental matters is million 
however  in april  the purchaser went into receivership and is highly unlikely to be able to honor its environmental indemnification commitments to the company 
the receiver is in the process of selling off purchaser s assets and has recently sold the purchaser s ownership interest in the former land and equipment of the hickson plant site in castleford  england 
the company does not believe there has been any change in its environmental exposure at the site 
the company does not anticipate any material exposure related to the environmental indemnifications for the microelectronic materials  the sulfuric acid and the hickson organics dispositions 
the company has estimated that the fair value of any such additional exposure would be immaterial 

table of contents associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial efforts of million and million were recorded in and and were not material to operating results in  but may be material in future years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income

the company s estimated environmental liability relates to eight sites  six of which are in the united states and none of which are on the us national priority list 
these amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures  any consideration of insurance recoveries or any advances in technology 
these liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed or if the costs of remediation efforts can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range from million to million over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies and remedial activities  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against the company

business and credit concentrations a significant portion of sales of the treatment products segment approximately is dependent upon two customers  one of which accounts for a significant portion of the sales of the hth water products business and the other of which accounts for a significant portion of the sales of the personal care and industrial biocides businesses

historically  approximately of the sales in the hth water products business occur in the second quarter of the fiscal year  as retail sales in the us residential pool market are concentrated between memorial day and the fourth of july 
therefore  interim results for this segment are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year

on february   the company declared a quarterly dividend of on each share of the company s common stock 
the dividend is payable on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the accounting policies used 
certain accounting policies require that estimates and assumptions be made by management for use in the preparation of the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results and that require subjective or complex estimates by management 
these include the following goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and identified intangible assets on a business by business basis reporting unit for impairment 
the company evaluates each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  the company would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company measures the fair value of a reporting unit as the estimated discounted future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the business continues in perpetuity 
the long term terminal growth assumptions reflect our current long term view of the marketplace 
the discount rate is based upon our weighted average cost of capital of each reporting unit 
each year the company re evaluates the assumptions in the discounted cash flow model to address changes in the business and marketplace conditions 
based upon the annual impairment analysis  which is completed in the first quarter  the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value and as a result  the company did not need to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by the company and its competitors and the volatility in the markets in which the company conducts business 
a change in assumptions in the company s cash flows could have a significant impact on the fair value of the company s reporting units  which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company s results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include certain deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are recorded based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates  future compensation levels  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and trends in health care costs  which are updated annually 
the company evaluates these assumptions annually with its actuarial advisors and believe that they are within acceptable industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside the control of the company could have a material impact on the results of operations 
the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure expense for any fiscal year are determined as of january of the current plan year 
accumulated and projected benefit obligations represent the present value of future cash payments 
the discount rate is based upon a yield curve consistent with the payment stream constructed from market observed yields for high quality bonds 
the expected return on plan assets is based on the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
valuation of long lived assets the impairment of tangible and intangible assets is assessed when changes in circumstances such as  but not limited to  a decrease in market value of an asset  current and historical operating losses or a change in business strategy indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based on estimates of future cash flows  salvage values or net sales proceeds 
these estimates take into account management s expectations and judgments regarding future business and economic conditions  future market values and disposal costs 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
environmental liabilities liabilities for environmental matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these estimates take into account current law  existing technologies and management s judgment about future changes in regulation 
each quarter the company formally evaluates known and potential sites  and when there are changes in circumstances 
the company reviews estimates for future remediation  and maintenance and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
the company s estimate of environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken or current laws and regulations be changed 
for additional information  see the environmental discussion in item of this report 

table of contents legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates its current proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel and when there are changes in circumstances 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
incentive compensation the company maintains a long term employee incentive compensation plan that is intended to reward eligible employees for their contributions to the company s long term success 
provisions for employee incentive compensation are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s financial target for the long term incentive plan is return on equity to be achieved in three years  which can be accelerated and earned in two years 
the financial targets are set annually by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
if the financial targets are not going to be achieved at the end of year three  one half of the reward is forfeited and the remaining award is earned over the remaining three year period 
therefore  changes in the company s estimated financial performance  could have a significant impact on the amount of compensation expense recorded by the company in any given period 
for additional information about significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

r  share based payment which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees

the company has no unvested portions of previously issued or outstanding awards and the company currently does not intend to issue any stock awards to employees in or the foreseeable future
