taxation for us federal and state income tax purposes  we are not a taxable entity 
federal and state income taxes on our taxable income are borne by our individual partners through the allocation of our taxable income 
such taxable income may vary substantially from net income reported in our consolidated statements of income

item a 
risk factors we encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less 
our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our pipeline systems 
decreases in the volumes transported by our systems  whether caused by supply or demand factors in the markets these systems serve  competition or otherwise  can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the volume of shipments on our lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western canadian crude oil 
insufficient supplies of western canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our lakehead system 
crude oil deliveries on our lakehead system have declined from the prior year in each of the last three calendar years  because of decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western canada and other factors including supply disruption and competition 
in january  deliveries on our lakehead system were impacted by a fire at a suncor facility 
the volume of crude oil that we transport on the lakehead system also depends on the demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the delivery by others of crude oil and refined products into these regions and the province of ontario 
pipeline capacity for the delivery of crude oil to the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states currently exceeds refining capacity 
in addition  our ability to increase deliveries to expand the lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western canadian crude oil 
we expect that growth in future supplies of western canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in alberta  canada 
furthermore  full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our current and future expansions of the lakehead system  including the terrace expansion program  will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects 
the volume of shipments on natural gas systems depends on the supply of natural gas and ngls available for shipment on those systems from the producing regions that supply these systems 
volumes shipped on these systems also are affected by the demand for natural gas and ngls in the markets these systems serve 
existing customers may not extend their contracts if the availability of natural gas from the mid continent  gulf coast and east texas producing regions was to decline or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems was to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical 
we may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees 
changes in our tariff rates or challenges to our tariff rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  a recent ferc policy statement that limited allowances for income tax in an unrelated pipeline s cost of service  if applied to our ferc regulated systems  could adversely affect our rates 
the tariff rates charged by several of our existing pipeline systems are regulated by the ferc  or various state regulatory agencies 
if one of these regulatory agencies  on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties  were to lower our tariff rates  the profitability of our pipeline businesses might suffer 
if we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline  there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect  which delay could further reduce our cash flow 
furthermore  competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so 
the regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically propose and implement new rules and regulations  terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction 
new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the tariff rates charged for our services 
several states  including oklahoma and texas  are taking a more active role in the rate and service regulation of gathering and intrastate transmission natural gas systems 
increased state regulation could adversely impact our natural gas systems 
the question of whether and to what extent an income tax allowance should be included in a regulated utility s cost of service for rate making purposes was a matter of uncertainty for a number of years 
in a decision involving an oil pipeline limited partnership  bp west coast  llc v 
ferc  a united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the ferc s policy that allowed an oil pipeline limited partnership to include in its costs of service an income tax allowance to the extent that its unitholders were corporations subject to income tax 
in its policy statement on income tax allowances issued on may   the ferc concluded that it would permit an income tax allowance for all entities or individuals owning public utility assets  provided that such entities or individuals have an actual or potential income tax liability on the public utility income 
the burden is on the entity seeking the income tax allowance in a specific rate proceeding to establish that its partners have an actual or potential income tax obligation on the entity s public utility income 
whether a pipeline s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the ferc on a case by case basis 
although the new policy is generally favorable for pipelines that are organized as pass through entities  it still entails rate risk due to the case by case review requirement 
on december   ferc issued its first case specific oil pipeline review of the income tax allowance issue in the sfpp proceeding  reaffirming its new income tax allowance policy and directing sfpp to provide certain evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance 
further  in the december order  ferc concluded that for tax allowance purposes  ferc would apply a rebuttable presumption that corporate partners of pass through entities pay the maximum marginal tax rate of and that non corporate partners of pass through entities pay a marginal tax rate of 
the new tax allowance policy as applied to the bp west coast decision is subject to rehearing and possible further action by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit or another court on appeal 
further  application of the ferc s policy statement in individual cases may be subject to further ferc action or review in the appropriate court of appeals 
the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  therefore  is not certain and could result in changes to the ferc s treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service 
if we were to file for a cost of service based rate increase  we would be subject to ferc s new policy and potential challenges of that policy 
on our lakehead system  base rates are subject to the ferc indexing mechanism consistent with our expired settlement agreement and are not currently affected by the tax allowance policy 
however  the original base rates calculated in accordance with the settlement agreement employed a lower tax allowance than provided for by the new policy 
were the lakehead system  or any of our ferc regulated systems  subject to a cost of service regulatory proceeding in the future  the tax allowance issue would be one of the many factors which would affect the resulting rates 
competition may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system faces current  and potentially further competition for transporting western canadian crude oil from other pipelines  which may reduce its revenues 
our lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota  chicago  illinois  detroit  michigan  toledo  ohio  buffalo  new york  and sarnia  ontario and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the patoka wood river area of southern illinois 
refineries in the markets served by our lakehead system compete with refineries in western canada  the province of ontario and the rocky mountain region of the united states for supplies of western canadian crude oil 
our ozark pipeline system could face a significant increase in competition if a proposed new pipeline from hardisty  alberta to patoka is completed in however  if that situation occurs  we would consider potential alternative uses for our ozark system 
we also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transmission businesses 
many of the large wholesale customers served by our systems transmission and wholesale customer pipelines have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
thus  many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines and or from third parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines 
likewise  most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have other alternatives  such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without processing 
some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us  which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do 
competition with enbridge may reduce our revenues 
enbridge has agreed with us that  so long as an affiliate of enbridge is our general partner  enbridge and its subsidiaries may not engage in or acquire any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses  subject to the following exceptions enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses  including the normal development of such businesses  in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in december  such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any competitive business as part of a larger acquisition  so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired  in enbridge s reasonable judgment  is not attributable to the competitive business  and enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any competitive business if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and we fail to approve  after submission to a vote of unitholders  the making of the acquisition 
since we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business 
in addition  enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our lakehead system even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business 
this agreement also expressly permitted the reversal by enbridge in of one of its pipelines that extends from sarnia  ontario to montreal  quebec 
as a result of this reversal  enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the ontario  canada market 
this competition from enbridge has reduced our deliveries of crude oil to ontario 
our gas marketing operations involve market and certain regulatory risks 
as part of our natural gas marketing activities  we purchase natural gas at prices determined by prevailing market conditions 
following our purchase of natural gas  we generally resell natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract that is generally comparable in terms to our purchase contract  including any price escalation provisions 
the profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets  reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long term purchase contracts  consumers willingness to use other fuels when natural gas prices increase significantly  timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results  the ability of our customers to make timely payment  inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas on comparable terms  and changes in  limitiations upon  or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce 
our results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities 
we buy and sell natural gas and ngls in connection with our marketing activities 
commodity price exposure is also inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges 
further  hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts 
in addition certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark to market basis 
this causes periodic earning volatility due to turbulent commodity prices 
compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations  including any remediation of soil or water pollution or hydrostatic testing of our pipeline systems  may increase our costs and or reduce our revenues 
our pipeline  gathering  processing and trucking operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety 
liquid petroleum and natural gas transportation and processing operations always involve the risk of costs or liabilities or operational modifications related to regulatory compliance as well as resulting from historical environmental contamination  accidental releases or upsets  regulatory enforcement  litigation or safety and health incidents 
as a result  we may incur costs or liabilities of this type  or experience a reduction in revenues  in the future 
we may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations  enforcement policies or claims for personal  property or environmental damage 
we may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher tariffs 
failure of pipeline operations due to unforeseen interruptions or catastrophic events may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
operation of complex pipeline systems  gathering  treating  processing and trucking operations involves many risks  hazards and uncertainties  such as operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions caused by events beyond our control 
these events include adverse weather conditions  accidents  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions  fires  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  landslides or other similar events beyond our control 
a casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life or extensive property or environmental damage for which we may bear a part or all of the cost 
our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results  are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses or are unable to raise financing on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy 
acquisitions present various risks and challenges  including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations  the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration  and diversion of management s attention from existing operations 
in addition  we may be unable to identify acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions in the future or be unable to raise  on terms we find acceptable  any debt or equity financing that may be required for any such acquisition 
our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate which may limit our ability to increase cash distributions 
our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development  construction or other acquisitions of energy infrastructure assets 
increased demand for the steel used to fabricate the pipe needed for our construction projects and increased competition for labor has resulted in increased costs for these resources 
as a result  we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected 
if we experience material cost overruns  we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods using cash from operations  delaying other planned projects  incurring additional indebtedness  or issuing additional debt or equity 
any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results operations and cash flows 
our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility  the design  construction  development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems 
if our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays  or other factors  we may not meet our obligations as they become due and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget  sell non strategic assets  access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements 
oil measurement losses on the lakehead system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation  commodity prices and other factors 
oil measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement losses include physical losses  which occur through evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation losses  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation losses  which are a function of crude oil prices and the level of the carrier s inventory 
there are inherent difficulties in quantifying oil measurement losses because physical measurements of volumes are not practical due to the fact that products constantly move through the pipeline and virtually all of the pipeline system is located underground 
in our case  measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the length of the lakehead system and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products it carries 
accordingly  we utilize engineering based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses 
the interests of enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our securityholders  and the board of directors of enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict  not just the interests of our securityholders  in making important business decisions 
enbridge indirectly owns all of the stock of our general partner and all of the voting stock of enbridge management  and elects all of the directors of both companies 
furthermore  some of the directors and officers of our general partners and enbridge management are also directors and officers of enbridge 
consequently  conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and enbridge 
our partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
these restrictions allow our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict  including enbridge management s interests  our interests and those of our general partner 
in addition  these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our general partner or enbridge management  its delegee  should its directors or officers act in a way that  were it not for these limitations of liability  would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties 
we do not have any employees 
in managing our business and affairs  we will rely on employees of enbridge  and its affiliates  who will act on behalf of and as agents for us 
a decrease in the availability of employees from enbridge could adversely affect us 
we are exposed to credit risks of some of our customers our bamagas system has agreements to provide transportation of up to  mmbtu d of natural gas for a remaining period of years to two utility plants that are indirectly owned by calpine corporation 
the bamagas system receives a fixed demand charge of per mmbtu of natural gas for  mmbtu d  regardless of whether the capacity is used 
calpine has recently declared bankruptcy and is in reorganization 
although we fully expect our customer to continue to meet its obligations to us under the terms of the transportation agreements  we are exposed to a potential asset impairment of up to million  representing the book value of the pipeline  if the customer is unable to fulfill its commitments 
we are actively monitoring calpine s bankruptcy and are evaluating alternate uses for the system 
as a result of the widespread damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  the major credit rating agencies have issued negative credit implications for several of our industrial and utility customers 
although we do not anticipate any significant deterioration in the credit standing of these customers  we continue to monitor their financial condition and expect improvement in their credit standing as system outages are restored and property damage repaired 
canada s ratification of the kyoto protocol may adversely impact our operations 
in december  canada ratified the kyoto protocol  a treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below levels 
we and enbridge are monitoring the canadian federal government s approach to implementation 
while the united states is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol  other environmental protection initiatives have been implemented regulating certain priority pollutants 
during  a proposed revision to the us energy act was offered that would have  if it had passed  expanded the regulation of certain greenhouse gas emissions requiring a cap and establishing a trade to facilitate compliance 
the provision would have made natural gas pipelines the segment of the gas industry regulated by such an amendment 
while this legislation did not pass in  another proposal has been offered by the us congress early in while the outcome is uncertain at this time  if the provision passes  the partnership could be subject to additional costs to monitor and control emissions above and beyond current practices and permits 
risks arising from our partnership structure and relationships with our general partner and enbridge management we can issue additional common or other classes of units  including additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares  which would dilute your ownership interest 
the issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us  including the issuance of additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares  other than our quarterly distributions to you  may have the following effects the amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease  the relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease  and the market price of the class a common units may decline 
additionally  the public sale by our general partner of a significant portion of the class b common units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the class a common units 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the general partner or its affiliates 
a public or private sale of the class b common units currently held by our general partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding class a common units 
we are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries distributions to service our debt obligations 
we are a holding company with no material operations 
if we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries  we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions  which could further limit each operating subsidiary s ability to make distributions to us 
the debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by the subsidiary guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities 
holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities 
the claims to the assets of these non guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries 
claims of our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt  including the debt securities 
our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors may include general creditors  trade creditors  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and creditors holding guarantees 
enbridge management s discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
enbridge management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures  provide for the proper conduct of business  comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our holders of common units 
risks related to our debt and our ability to distribute cash agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions  which could adversely affect the value of our class a common units  and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility 
our primary operating subsidiary is prohibited by its first mortgage notes from making distributions to us  and we are prohibited by our credit facility from making distributions to our unitholders  if a default exists under the respective governing agreements 
in addition  the agreements governing our credit facility and our subsidiary s first mortgage notes may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on incurring additional debt  entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets  and granting liens 
although the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt  they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of assets and to incur liens to secure debt 
a breach of any restriction under our credit facility or our indentures or our subsidiary s first mortgage notes could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and  in the case of the credit facility  terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions 
tax risks to common unitholders we may be classified as an association taxable as a corporation rather than as a partnership  which would substantially reduce the value of our class a common units 
we could be treated as a corporation for united states income tax purposes 
our treatment as a corporation would substantially reduce the cash distributions on the common units that we distribute quarterly 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation would materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
the anticipated benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on the treatment of us as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
under current law  we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any federal income tax at the entity level 
in order to qualify for this treatment  we must derive more than of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities 
while we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement  we may not find it possible  regardless of our efforts  to meet this income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this income requirement 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes without regard to our sources of income or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would pay state income taxes at varying rates 
under current law  distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed as a corporate distribution 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to a unitholder would be substantially reduced 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise  or other forms of taxation 
state tax legislation resulting in the imposition of a partnership level income tax on us would reduce the cash distributions on the common units and the value of the i units that we will distribute quarterly to enbridge management 
the enactment of significant legislation imposing partnership level income taxes could cause a reduction in the value of our units 
if the internal revenue service does not respect our curative tax allocations  the after tax return to our unitholders on their investment in our class a common units would be adversely affected 
our partnership agreement allows curative allocations of income  deduction  gain and loss by us to account for differences between the tax basis and fair market value of property at the time the property is contributed or deemed contributed to us and to account for differences between the fair market value and book basis of our assets existing at the time of issuance of any class a common units 
if the internal revenue service  which we refer to as the irs  does not respect our curative allocations  ratios of taxable income to cash distributions received by the holders of class a common units will be materially higher than previously estimated the tax liability of our unitholders could exceed their distributions or proceeds from sales of class a common units 
the holders of our class a common units will be required to pay united states federal income tax and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their allocable share of our income  even if they do not receive cash distributions from us 
they will not necessarily receive cash distributions equal to the tax on their allocable share of our taxable income 
further  if we have a large amount of nonrecourse liabilities  they may incur a tax liability that is greater than the money they receive when they sell their class a common units 
a unitholder may be required to file tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states where we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business 
in some cases  a unitholder may be required to file income tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states in which we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business  which are currently alabama  alaska  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  montana  new york  south carolina  north carolina  north dakota  oklahoma  tennessee  texas and wisconsin 
in the future  we may acquire property or do business in other states or in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition to tax liabilities to such state and foreign jurisdictions  the owner of a class a common unit may also incur tax and filing responsibilities to localities within such jurisdictions 
ownership of class a common units raises issues for tax exempt entities and other investors 
an investment in our class a common units by tax exempt entities  including employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts  keogh plans and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them 
virtually all of the income derived from our class a common units by a tax exempt entity will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to the tax exempt entity 
additionally  no significant part of our gross income will be considered qualifying income for purposes of determining whether a unitholder qualifies as a regulated investment company for its tax years beginning on or prior to october  before the american jobs creation act of 
further  a unitholder who is a nonresident alien  a foreign corporation or other foreign person will be required to file a federal income tax return and pay tax on his share of our taxable income because he will be regarded as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states as a result of his ownership of a class a common unit 
our registration with the secretary of the treasury as a tax shelter may increase your risk of an irs audit 
because we are a registered tax shelter with the secretary of the treasury  a unitholder may face an increased risk of an irs audit resulting in taxes payable on our income as well as income not related to us 
we could be audited by the irs and adjustments to our income or losses could be made 
any unitholder owning less than a profit interest in us has very limited rights to participate in the income tax and audit process 
further  any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us 
each unitholder is responsible for any tax owed as the result of an examination of their personal tax return 
our treatment of a purchaser of class a common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller could be challenged  resulting in a reduction in value of the class a common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of class a common units  we are required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of these units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of these units 
we do so by adopting certain depreciation conventions that do not conform with all aspects of the united states treasury regulations 
an irs challenge to these conventions could adversely affect the tax benefits to a unitholder of ownership of the class a common units and could have a negative impact on their value

substantially all of our lakehead system assets are subject to a first mortgage lien collateralizing indebtedness of our lakehead partnership 
titles to our properties acquired in the midcoast system acquisition are subject to encumbrances in some cases

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
results of operations overview we provide services to our customers and returns for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate pipeline transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and ngls through pipelines and related facilities  and providing supply  transportation and sales service  including purchasing and selling of natural gas and ngls 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota and mid continent systems 
each of these systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
our mid continent system is also one of the largest above ground crude oil storage facilities in north america  with the majority of the capacity available for merchant storage not subject to regulation by the ferc 
each of these systems generates most of its revenues by charging shippers a per barrel tariff rate to transport and store crude oil and liquid petroleum 
our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  including four ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipelines  as well as natural gas treating and processing plants and related facilities 
the revenues of our natural gas segment are derived from the fees we charge to gather and process natural gas and the rates we charge to transport natural gas on our pipelines 
our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services to producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
our marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental revenue on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide other services that are valued by our customers 
several types of arrangements in our natural gas and marketing segments expose us to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices where we receive natural gas or ngls in return for the services we provide  or where we purchase natural gas or ngls 
we employ derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices 
some of these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in our earnings that can be significant 
however  these fluctuations in earnings do not affect our cash flow 
cash flow is only affected when we settle the derivative financial instrument and the associated physical transaction 
the following table reflects our operating income by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years ended december in millions operating income liquids natural gas marketing corporate  operating and administrative total operating income interest expense rate refunds other income net income loss summary analysis of operating results liquids our liquids segment contributed operating income of million in  or million less than the million contributed in the operating income of our liquids segment in was affected by the following factors deliveries on our lakehead system declined by approximately  bpd primarily due to a fire in january at an upgrader site owned by suncor  an oil sands producer in alberta  canada 
a heavier crude oil mix and the annual index adjustment to our tariff rates generated additional revenue as did the full year contribution from our mid continent assets  more than offsetting the loss of revenue resulting from the lower transportation volumes on our lakehead system 
higher workforce related costs resulting from increases in pension and healthcare costs passed through to us and other general and administrative cost increases 
increased costs for the additional two months of ownership of our mid continent system assets in compared with natural gas operating income from our natural gas segment grew to million in representing an increase of million over the million generated in the increased contribution of our natural gas segment is attributable to the following average daily volume on our major natural gas systems was percent greater in than in  partially due to historically high natural gas prices  which encourage producers to generate and ship greater volumes of natural gas and ngl 
also contributing to the volume growth were the gathering and processing assets in north texas we acquired in january  and the addition of mmcf d of natural gas transportation capacity on our east texas system from our late june completion of the mile natural gas pipeline to the carthage  texas market hub 
operating income of our natural gas segment was also positively affected by a gain of million we realized on the sale of gathering and processing assets located in our east and south texas systems 
these gains were mostly offset by million of losses we realized from the settlement of natural gas derivatives in connection with the sale 
we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with this natural gas derivative that were realized upon settlement 
keep whole processing arrangements contributed to improved results 
two factors contributed to this increase  first ngl prices increased in relation to the cost of our natural gas feedstocks 
second  additional processing capacity was commissioned in in combination  these factors resulted in an increase of million in revenue less cost of natural gas 
the operating results of our natural gas segment were negatively affected by unrealized non cash mark to market losses of million associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and ineffectiveness charges associated with hedges that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
operating income of our natural gas segment in included an increase of million in operating and administrative costs from the increase is attributable to increases in workforce related costs  costs that are variable with the incremental volumes gathered  processed and transported on our systems  the acquisition of gathering and processing assets in north texas and repair and maintenance and related costs resulting from maintenance and downtime at three of our processing facilities 
marketing our marketing segment incurred losses of million in  which include unrealized  non cash mark to market losses of million  compared with million of operating income for the corresponding period in the operating income of our marketing segment in was affected by the following factors strong growth in natural gas production in the texas markets we serve has created constraints in the available pipeline capacity used by our marketing business to transport and deliver natural gas into premium priced downstream markets 
these pipeline constraints have limited the ability of our marketing business to sell natural gas into these more attractive markets until additional pipeline capacity can be acquired and other alternatives become available 
during the last four months of  supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico region caused by hurricanes katrina and rita created greater demand for natural gas from the onshore production areas that our marketing business serves  increasing our ability to optimize revenue from the sale of unhedged natural gas volumes to areas of greater demand 
we were adversely affected by significant non cash volatility associated with our portfolio of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
derivative transactions and hedging activities we record all financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair market value pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
for those derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  all changes in fair market value are recorded through our consolidated statements of income each period 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  although that is not our intent 
a volatile natural gas and ngl pricing environment during our fiscal year ended december   produced non cash mark to market losses of million and negatively affected our operating results 
while these mark to market losses create volatility in our results  the derivative financial instruments do not affect our cash flow until they are settled 
we expect these non cash losses to reverse in future periods as we settle the derivative financial instruments against the underlying physical transactions 
because of the economic benefit we receive by minimizing the volatility in our cash flows by using derivative financial instruments to hedge our portfolio of natural gas and ngl  we intend to continue using them 
our continued use of derivative financial instruments may result in additional unrealized  non cash losses or gains in the future 
the following table presents the unrealized losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivatives  which are recorded as an element of cost of natural gas in our consolidated statements of income and disclosed as a reconciling item on our statements of cash flows derivative fair value losses december  december  december  in millions natural gas segment ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges discontinuance derivative fair value losses in connection with the sale of a processing plant and related facilities and other gathering and processing assets located in our east and south texas systems  we settled for cash of approximately million  natural gas collars representing derivative financial instruments on forecasted sales of  mmbtu d of natural gas through we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with the natural gas collars that were realized upon settlement 
additionally  we de designated derivative financial instruments that were qualified for and designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales of bpd of ngls through and contemporaneously closed out the position by entering into an offsetting derivative financial instrument  at market  on forecasted purchases of bpd of ngls for the same term 
results of operations by segment liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota  and mid continent systems 
we provide a detailed description of each of these systems in item business 
the following tables set forth the operating results and statistics of our liquids segment for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating results operating revenues operating and administrative power depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating income operating statistics lakehead system united states province of ontario total deliveries barrel miles billions average haul miles mid continent system deliveries north dakota system deliveries average barrels per day in thousands 
ten months of deliveries in year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income in  representing a decrease of million or over the same period in lower results on the lakehead system were modestly offset by stronger results on our north dakota system and a full twelve month contribution from our mid continent system compared with a ten month contribution for the same period in operating revenue in increased by million or to million  compared with million for the same period in our mid continent assets contributed higher operating revenue of approximately million for the additional two months of ownership in compared to overall tariff increases and longer hauls on our north dakota system were mostly offset by lower deliveries on the lakehead system during average daily crude oil deliveries on the lakehead system decreased approximately  from million bpd during to million bpd during this resulted in lower operating revenue for of approximately million 
the decrease is the result of lower than expected crude oil supply in western canada from three factors 
first  suncor  an oil sands producer in alberta  canada  had a fire at their upgrader site on january  as a result of the incident  suncor s production was reduced by an average of  bpd during the first nine months of in late september  suncor announced that repairs to the upgrader site and an expansion were completed and production capacity has increased as a result 
second  western canadian crude oil supply available for delivery on our lakehead system was also reduced during due to lower bitumen supplies 
the nature of the cyclic steaming process used to extract bitumen from the ground can cause production timing differences during the year 
finally  during the second quarter of  kinder morgan  inc  an unrelated company  completed an expansion on its express pipeline system 
the expansion increased capacity on this pipeline by approximately  bpd 
given the volume commitments on the express pipeline expansion  coupled with the lower western canadian crude oil supply as noted above  deliveries on our lakehead system were negatively impacted for management believes that holders of firm capacity on the express pipeline will first satisfy their commitments to that pipeline before moving incremental barrels on the lakehead system 
increases in average tariffs on all three liquids systems resulted in higher operating revenue by approximately million 
these tariff increases were mostly the result of the annual index rate increase of approximately allowed by the ferc that became effective july   on our base system tariffs 
on the lakehead system  new tariffs also went into effect on april  for an adjustment on the terrace expansion program surcharge due to lower than expected volumes moving on the lakehead system 
longer hauls on our north dakota system also contributed to higher average tariffs  as production in montana continued to be strong during operating and administrative expenses for increased by million to million  compared with million in the increase was attributable to the following factors workforce related costs increased by approximately million due to higher pension  medical and other benefits costs  along with increased administrative  regulatory and compliance support  operating and administrative expenses on our mid continent system increased approximately million due to a full year s ownership in  compared with ten months in  capital project recoveries were lower by approximately million due to a decrease in utilization of our workforce on capital projects and a reduction in construction activity on our liquids systems  oil measurement losses increased approximately million 
oil measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquids pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement losses include physical losses  which occur through evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation losses  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation losses  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of the carrier s inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
during  the increase in oil measurement losses was a function of two factors higher volumetric physical losses associated with changes in commodity properties and measurement  coupled with higher oil prices that made the monetary value of normal physical losses more expensive 
during  the average west texas intermediate crude oil price was approximately per barrel compared with approximately per barrel during  wider light heavy crude price differentials made degradation losses more expensive 
during  light heavy differentials were approximately per barrel compared with approximately per barrel in power costs increased million  or  in compared with  mostly due to higher electricity rates and a full twelve month contribution from our mid continent system compared to ten months in  partially offset by lower energy consumption related to lower lakehead volumes 
power costs associated with the mid continent system increased approximately million in depreciation and amortization increased million  or  in compared to the increase is driven primarily by a full twelve month contribution from our mid continent system and an increase in the depreciable asset base on our lakehead system in year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income  an increase of million or over liquids operating income 
the primary driver of the increase in was our newly acquired mid continent system  which contributed million of operating income to the liquids segment 
segment operating revenues increased by million or in compared with  largely due to a million contribution from our mid continent system 
operating revenues from our lakehead system increased or  mostly due to increased deliveries 
deliveries on our lakehead system increased during  primarily from increased production of western canadian crude oil transported on that system 
overall  production of western canadian crude oil increased in the last two years mainly due to the start up of new oil sands projects in the province of alberta 
these latest oil sands projects differ from conventional oil production in two ways 
first  oil sands deposits are a mixture of bitumen  water  sand and clay 
as a result  oil production takes the form of either mining the oil sands from subsurface deposits and separating out the water  sand and clay components  or  if the deposits are deeper  heating the reservoir sufficiently to flow the pure bitumen to the well base and then to the surface 
second  the bitumen requires either upgrading or blending prior to being sent to market 
the upgrading process partially refines the bitumen into a crude stream  which can be readily refined by most conventional refineries 
this product is known as synthetic crude oil 
during  crude oil production increased in western canada  primarily due to the start up of the athabasca oil sands project in june the aosp is owned by shell canada limited  chevron canada limited and western oil sands lp  and consists of oil sands mining and bitumen extraction operations with a current capacity of  bpd 
deliveries on our lakehead system reflect a full year s impact from this new source of supply 
operating revenues on our north dakota system also increased in by million or  primarily due to an increase in transportation of longer haul  higher margin barrels resulting from improved production in montana 
operating and administrative expenses of our liquids segment increased by million  or  in compared with  mostly due to our new mid continent system  which had operating and administrative expenses of million 
operating and administrative expenses on our lakehead system increased by million  or 
this increase was attributable primarily to three factors workforce related costs increased by million due to higher pension and medical costs and other related general and administrative expenses 
oil measurement losses increased by million due to the impact of higher crude oil prices and increased volumes on the system  which contributed to the physical losses 
we made refinements in the oil measurement loss estimation process in valuing different types of crude oil on station lines resulting in an increase of approximately million to our oil measurement loss 
the refinements were the result of engineering studies completed in the fourth quarter of property taxes increased million  or 
we have experienced a trend of increasing property taxes partially due to new facilities placed into service  and also due to increases from the taxing authorities in counties and states where our pipeline assets are located 
these increases in operating and administrative expenses on our lakehead system were partially offset by lower leak remediation and repair costs of approximately million  or 
power costs increased million  or  in compared with  mostly due to the growth in volumes on the lakehead system and higher generating rates attributable to higher demand and fuel costs 
power costs associated with the mid continent system were million in depreciation and amortization increased million  or  over depreciation on the mid continent system accounted for million and the balance relates to new facilities placed into service within our liquids segment during and future prospects for liquids historically  western canada has been a key source of oil supply serving us energy needs 
canada s oil sands  one of the largest oil reserves in the world  are becoming an increasingly prominent source of supply 
new production from the oil sands is expected to grow progressively during the next five years  with an additional  to  bpd available by conventional oil production is expected to decline by about  bpd during the same period 
the net increased production will result from an estimated billion of active or planned projects that are being developed in the oil sands 
enbridge and the partnership are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will allow canadian crude oil access to new markets 
after receiving strong shipper support during an open season  the partnership and enbridge announced approval of the  bpd southern access expansion project  which has received endorsement from capp 
a decision from the ferc on tariff principles negotiated with shippers is expected before mid year fieldwork has commenced to ensure completion in early  with capacity increases to start in the us portion of the expansion will be undertaken on our lakehead system with the first stage to add approximately  bpd of capacity in and up to an additional  bpd by early the first stage includes a new pipeline between superior and delavan  wisconsin  along with pump station enhancements upstream and downstream of this segment 
the second stage of the expansion project will provide additional upstream pumping capacity and a new pipeline from delavan to flanagan  illinois  with completion expected in early completion of the total southern access expansion project will create a mile pipeline with approximately  bpd of incremental capacity on our lakehead system 
the design will also permit a further  bpd increase in capacity for minimal additional cost  in conjunction with a corresponding expansion upstream of superior  when required by shippers 
in another effort to provide shippers access to new markets  enbridge acquired a pipeline that runs from cushing  oklahoma to chicago  and has reversed its flow 
the pipeline has been renamed the spearhead pipeline and will provide capacity to deliver  bpd into the major oil hub at cushing in early we expect to benefit following the reversal  as western canadian crude oil will be carried on the lakehead system as far as chicago  and then transferred to the spearhead pipeline 
the partnership and enbridge believe that the southern access program  the spearhead pipeline reversal  and other initiatives to provide access to new markets in the midwest  mid continent and gulf coast  offer flexible solutions to future transportation requirements of western canadian crude oil producers  and the in service timing of these solutions is in line with prospective shipper needs 
average daily crude oil deliveries on the lakehead system are expected to increase by approximately  bpd during  from million bpd in to approximately million bpd in the increase is mainly attributable to the re start of suncor s upgrader in late september after the january fire  along with commissioning of suncor s expansion in the last quarter of in addition to these volumes  we expect the commissioning of syncrude s ue expansion in mid  resulting in ultimate incremental production of  bpd 
our north dakota system has benefitted over the past two years from the six and percent average annual production growth in north dakota and montana  respectively 
we expect deliveries on our north dakota system to be approximately  bpd in our mid continent system consists of the ozark and the west tulsa pipelines 
the west tulsa pipeline moves crude oil from cushing to tulsa 
throughput deliveries on this system are expected to continue to remain stable  given the recent strength in refinery margins experienced by the industry 
the ozark pipeline system transports crude oil from cushing to wood river and provides access to the wood river  east of patoka  and minnesota refining areas through its connection to other systems 
the ozark system depends upon the demand of the wood river and east of patoka refineries for crude oil from west texas  and imports from the gulf coast 
we expect steady to declining throughputs as more growth in canadian crude oil displaces imports from the gulf coast and demand for domestic west texas crude oil 
we expect deliveries on our two mid continent pipelines to be approximately  bpd in natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  as well as treating and processing plants and related facilities 
collectively  these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines including four ferc regulated transmission pipeline systems  eight natural gas treating plants  fifteen natural gas processing plants  and trucks  trailers and railcars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
the following tables set forth the operating results of our natural gas segment assets and average daily volumes of our major systems in mmbtu d for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets expenses operating income year ended december  average daily volume mmbtu d east texas anadarko north texas south texas utos midla alatenn kpc bamagas other major intrastates total anadarko includes the combined systems previously referred to separately as anadarko and palo duro 
the palo duro volumes were formerly included with other major intrastates 
we sold the south texas assets in december we recognize revenue upon delivery of natural gas and ngls to customers  and or when services are rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue in our natural gas segment from the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transporting raw natural gas and providing other similar services 
these revenues correspond with the volumes and types of services provided and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of the natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on the ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems  while revenues from intrastate pipelines are generally derived from the bundled sales of natural gas and transmission services 
customers of our ferc regulated natural gas pipeline systems typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
other arrangements we also use other types of arrangements to derive revenues for our natural gas segment 
these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which we substantially mitigate with offsetting physical purchases and sales and by the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions 
we will continue to hedge a significant amount of our commodity price risk to support the stability of our cash flows 
please refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for more information about our derivative activities 
these other types of arrangements are categorized as follows percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index price 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under the terms of these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the natural gas and ngls we process in the form of residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and sulfur  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
percentage of liquids contracts under these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of ngls and condensate from natural gas that requires processing 
this contract structure is similar to percentage of proceeds arrangements except that we only receive a percentage of the ngls and condensate 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased natural gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing for our own account  which we sell at market prices 
in instances where we purchase raw gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account the residue gas resulting from processing at market prices 
in those instances when we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue gas with a british thermal unit content equivalent to the original raw gas we received 
under the terms of each of these contract structures  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls as our fee in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
in order to protect our unitholders from volatility in our cash flows that can result from fluctuations in commodity prices  we enter into derivative financial instruments to effectively fix the sales price of the natural gas and ngls we anticipate receiving under the terms of these contracts 
as a result of entering into these derivative financial instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas and ngls  although the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income in  representing an increase of million  from the million earned in continuing favorable natural gas and ngl prices contributed to average daily volume increases of percent in on our major natural gas systems compared with the increase in volumes is primarily the result of additional wellhead supply contracts on our east texas and anadarko systems  as well as the additional volumes on the north texas system associated with the gathering and processing assets we acquired in january drilling activity continues to increase in the anadarko basin  bossier trend and barnett shale areas as evidenced by increasing rig counts and production volumes over the past several years 
additionally  completion of the east texas expansion project in late june contributed modestly to the growth in volumes for the year with continued investment in our systems to expand capacity  we expect our major natural gas systems to benefit from the increase in production volumes expected to result from the continuing increase in drilling activities in the basins we serve 
partially offsetting the positive operating results derived from the increases in gathering  processing and transportation volumes on our natural gas systems were non cash  mark to market net losses of million associated with our derivative transactions and hedging activities 
included in cost of natural gas are non cash losses of million resulting from ineffectiveness associated with our qualified cash flow hedges and million of non cash mark to market losses from derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the non cash losses primarily result from the significant increases in forward natural gas and ngl prices during the year 
the increase in prices reduces the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments because the fixed price component of these derivatives is significantly less than the market price of natural gas at each of the forward settlement points 
also included in our operating results for the year ended december  is a gain of million we realized in december  when we divested non strategic assets located within our east and south texas systems 
we sold for million in cash  a processing plant and related facilities  and other gathering and processing assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
we incurred selling costs of approximately million 
in connection with this sale  we paid approximately million to settle natural gas hedges associated with the natural gas produced by these assets 
we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with the natural gas hedges that were realized upon settlement 
the reported amounts are subject to change pending the final settlement of the sale 
a variable element of the natural gas segment s operating income is derived from keep whole processing of natural gas primarily on our anadarko and east texas systems 
this contract structure requires us to process natural gas at times when it may not be economical to do so 
this can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or ngl prices are unusually low 
during  although natural gas prices were unusually high  they were more than offset by favorable ngl prices 
operating revenue less cost of natural gas derived from keep whole processing for the year was approximately million compared with million in operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million  or greater for than  primarily as a result of increased workforce related costs and costs that are variable with volumes 
workforce related costs increased million due to higher pension  medical and other benefits  as well as additional administrative  regulatory and compliance support 
costs that are incremental with volumes  such as chemicals  materials and supplies and direct workforce expenses increased by million 
additionally  the natural gas gathering and processing assets we acquired in january contributed to the cost increases of approximately million 
as well  our maintenance costs increased by approximately million in due to several processing plants that underwent major repairs  one of which was included with the recently divested assets 
our depreciation and amortization expense for the year exceeded the amount reported for by approximately million  primarily as a result of acquisitions and significant capital projects completed and placed in service during the increase in depreciation expense was partially offset by modest extensions of the depreciable lives of our major pipeline systems as a result of a depreciation study completed during the third quarter of based on a third party study commissioned by management  revised depreciation rates for the anadarko  north texas and east texas systems were implemented effective august  the annual composite rate  which represents the expected remaining service life of these natural gas systems  was reduced from to 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was approximately million lower as a result of the new depreciation rates 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment accounted for million of operating income  an increase of million  or  over natural gas operating income 
compared with  average daily volumes on our major natural gas systems increased in  mostly due to the contribution of our north texas system from the acquisition date of december  our north texas system contributed million to operating income in  which was consistent with our expectations for the first year of ownership 
volumes on our east texas system increased by in  compared with the same period in  as a result of increased drilling by producers of gas wells in the areas served by the system 
these volume increases resulted in higher operating revenue less cost of natural gas of million compared with volumes on our anadarko system increased by approximately in  compared with the same period in the growth is a result of increased drilling activity in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma regions 
the higher volumes contributed to an increase of million in operating revenue less cost of natural gas 
high natural gas prices positively impacted volumes on our gathering and processing systems 
this positive impact was compounded by favorable processing economics in as described in our comparison  keep whole processing is a variable element of the natural gas segment s operating income 
during  operating income associated with keep whole processing was approximately million compared with million in during  natural gas prices were high but were more than offset by favorable ngl prices 
on our east texas system  we processed  mmtbu d of natural gas in  which was an increase of compared with volumes processed in due to more favorable ngl pricing conditions in  processing activities contributed million of operating income 
this compares with million of operating income for processing activities in the increase in business activity on our east texas system has resulted in higher operating revenue and administrative expenses of million  or  in compared with these costs are mostly variable in nature and relate to higher workforce related costs associated with an increase in our operations staff  as well as higher overall benefit costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses 
as a result  operating income on our east texas system increased million  or  in compared with similar to our east texas system  processing results improved on our anadarko system during due to a more favorable natural gas and ngl pricing environment 
on our anadarko system  we processed  mmbtu d of natural gas in  which was an increase of compared with volumes processed in processing activities contributed to million of operating income in this compares with million of operating income for processing activities in these improvements to operating income were partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses mostly related to variable costs associated with the increased volumes on the system 
as a result  operating income on the anadarko system increased by million  or  in compared with the increase in business activity on our natural gas systems has resulted in higher operating and administrative expenses of million in compared with these costs are mostly variable in nature and relate to higher workforce related costs associated with an increase in our operations staff  as well as higher overall benefit costs and an increase in repairs and maintenance expenses in relation to the higher volumes 
the remainder of the change in operating income in the natural gas segment was due to overall decreased results on the balance of our natural gas systems 
future prospects for natural gas our natural gas assets are located in the gulf coast and mid continent regions of the united states  two of the premier natural gas producing areas 
as a result  there are many opportunities to connect new natural gas supplies either by installing new facilities or acquiring adjacent third party gathering operations 
consolidation with neighboring facilities will extract efficiencies by eliminating costs  for example  by combining redundant facilities  increasing volume  and increasing processing margins 
these opportunities tend to involve modest amounts of capital with attractive rates of return 
we continue to assess various acquisition and expansion opportunities to pursue our strategy for growth 
the market for acquiring energy transportation assets is active and competition among prospective acquirers of assets has been significant 
while we remain committed to making accretive acquisitions in or near areas where we already operate or have a competitive advantage  we will continue to focus our efforts primarily on development of our existing pipeline systems 
although one of our objectives is to grow our natural gas business through acquisitions  we may and have pursued opportunities to divest of any non strategic natural gas assets as conditions warrant 
results of our natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
during  increased drilling in the areas where our gathering systems are located has generally contributed to our volume growth 
we expect the growth trend in these areas to continue in the future as evidenced by third party reserve studies and the increase in rig counts in the areas served by our systems 
continuing advances in seismic and drilling completion technology  along with robust energy prices  have been key drivers for the higher drilling activity levels in such areas as the tight gas and gas shale locations of the mid continent and east texas 
other advances in drilling technology are enabling producers to more economically extract natural gas from wells and increase well productivity 
one of the prominent areas in which this is occurring is the barnett shale play in north texas 
the barnett shale is a prominent natural gas formation within the fort worth basin  and it is being actively developed 
the formation produced approximately mmcf d in and had grown to over  mmcf d by july we anticipate that throughput on the north texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several years as a result of barnett shale development 
the rate of growth on our anadarko system continues to exceed projections as a result of the rapid development of the granite wash play in hemphill and wheeler counties 
to accommodate this continuing volume growth  the anadarko system requires additional processing capacity and field compression 
we are set to expand our system processing capacity in the region from mmcf d to approximately mmcf d  which we expect to place in service in early in the east texas region  our overall system receipts rose to over mmbtu d shortly after we brought our newly constructed mmcf d intrastate transmission pipeline on line in mid to carry increased volumes of natural gas to the carthage hub 
producer drilling plans in regional plays  including the bossier trend and deep bossier  are expected to result in continued production growth 
to accommodate this further growth  we will increase our gathering and treating infrastructure and market access capability 
to further this objective we have committed to a million expansion of our east texas system 
the key components of this project include a inch diameter intrastate pipeline from bethel  texas to orange county  texas with capacity of approximately mmcf d  will be completed in stages throughout the new line will provide service to a number of major industrial and power companies in southeast texas and will cross a number of interstate pipelines 
a mmcf d treating facility to be built near marquez  texas will be connected to the inch pipe via a new inch diameter pipeline  to be completed in early a number of upstream facilities  including gathering pipelines to tie existing facilities into the new intrastate pipeline  will also be completed in early when fully operational in late  the new assets will be an additional source of stable cash flow for us 
we are also evaluating other projects that further integrate all our major texas centered pipeline systems 
we are also working with enbridge on its proposed interstate extension from our texas natural gas midstream business 
enbridge announced an open season on a proposed mile  billion cubic feet per day pipeline from texas through louisiana  to interconnect with other interstate systems in western mississippi 
this project  if supported by shippers  could draw  additional volumes through our east texas system and its proposed expansion announced in january our bamagas system has agreements to provide transportation of up to  mmbtu d of natural gas for a remaining period of years to two utility plants that are indirectly owned by calpine corporation calpine 
calpine is the sole customer served by the bamagas system 
the bamagas system receives a fixed demand charge of per mmbtu of natural gas for  mmbtu d  regardless of whether the capacity is used 
in december  calpine and many of its subsidiaries  including the subsidiary that owns the two utility plants served by our bamagas sytem  filed voluntarily petitions to restructure under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in connection with the bankruptcy filing  calpine has announced receipt of commitments for up to billion of debtor in possession  or dip financing to allow for the continued operation of their power plants 
our bamagas system is the sole supplier of natural gas to these two utility plants  and we expect the subsidiary that owns these utility plants to continue performing under the terms of our agreement 
due to the recent nature of the bankruptcy filing  we are unable to determine the extent of any losses to which we may be subject as a result of the bankruptcy 
we are actively monitoring the calpine bankruptcy proceedings and will recognize any losses that may result when it becomes evident that a loss has been incurred 
marketing the following table sets forth the operating results for the marketing segment assets for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses operating income loss natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store and transport natural gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
as a result of the widespread damage caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  the major credit rating agencies have issued negative credit implications for several of our industrial and utility customers 
although we do not anticipate any significant deterioration in the credit standing of our other customers  we continue to monitor their financial condition  and expect improvement in their credit standing as system outages are restored and property damage repaired 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  a majority of the operating income of our marketing segment is derived from selling natural gas received from customers on our natural gas segment pipeline assets to end users of natural gas 
a majority of the natural gas is purchased in texas markets where we have limited physical access to the primary interstate pipeline delivery points  or hubs such as waha  texas and the houston ship channel 
as a result  our marketing business must use third party pipelines to transport the natural gas to these markets where it can be sold to customers 
however  physical pipeline constraints often require our marketing business to transport natural gas to alternate market points 
under these circumstances  our marketing segment will sell the purchased gas at a pricing index that is different from the pricing index at which the gas was purchased 
this creates a price exposure that arises from the relative difference in natural gas prices between the contracted index at which the natural gas is purchased and the index under which it is sold  otherwise known as the spread 
the spread can vary significantly due to local supply and demand factors 
wherever possible  this pricing exposure is economically hedged using derivative financial instruments 
however  the structure of these economic hedges often precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create another element of volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
to ensure that we have access to primary pipeline delivery points  we often enter into firm transportation agreements on interstate and intrastate pipelines 
in order to offset the demand charges associated with these firm transportation contracts  we look for market conditions that allow us to lock in the price differential or spread between the pipeline receipt point and pipeline delivery point 
this allows our marketing business to lock in a fixed return  inclusive of pipeline demand charges 
we accomplish this by transacting basis swaps between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold 
by transacting a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in a margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  mitigating the demand charges on firm transportation agreements and limiting our exposure to cash flow volatility that could arise in markets where the firm transportation becomes uneconomic 
however  the structure of these transactions precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to natural gas basis swaps  we contract for storage to assist balancing natural gas supply and end use market sales 
in order to mitigate the absolute price differential between the cost of injected natural gas and withdrawn natural gas  as well as storage fees  the injection and withdrawal price differential  or spread is hedged by buying fixed price swaps for the forecasted injection periods and selling fixed price swaps for the forecasted withdrawal periods 
when the injection and withdrawal spread increases or decreases in value as a result of market price movements  we can earn additional profit through the optimization of those hedges in both the forward and daily markets 
although each of these hedge strategies are sound economic hedging techniques  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under the sfas no 
guidelines 
as such  the non qualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value  although non cash  will impact the income statement 
during the third and fourth quarters  disruptions of natural gas supplies from facilities in the gulf of mexico region caused by hurricanes katrina and rita created greater demand for natural gas production from our onshore natural gas segment pipeline assets  increasing our ability to optimize natural gas supply to areas of strongest demand 
as a result of the hurricanes  unusual volatility in the prices of natural gas created greater spreads on our natural gas volumes 
although our marketing segment was not adversely affected from the temporary supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico  we generally continue to be affected by lower unit margins on natural gas volumes purchased due to physical pipeline constraints 
the recent completion of our east texas system expansion has partially alleviated these constraints  however  increasing production volumes will continue to create additional market outlet constraints 
these additional pipeline constraints will require continued use of third party pipelines in east texas 
this situation is not limited to the east texas region 
pricing in our natural gas supply markets is expected to continue to experience increasing pressure due to a greater supply of natural gas from the rocky mountains  mid continent and north texas 
for this reason we continue to increase our commitments on third party pipelines to mitigate these constraints and provide more attractive market outlets for our natural gas supply 
however  there continues to be timing differences between the acquisition of new third party pipeline capacity and the negotiation of applicable downstream sales agreements 
until new markets are developed  our marketing segment sells greater portions of its natural gas supply in less attractive short term markets 
for the year ended december   our marketing segment incurred losses of million  which include non cash mark to market losses of million  compared with earning million of operating income for the corresponding period in the non cash  mark to market losses are associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
during  we revised our business strategy for the use of derivative financial instruments associated with the transportation and storage of natural gas to afford us the ability to respond to changing economic conditions 
the flexibility provided by our revised strategy precludes us from continuing the use of hedge accounting with regard to these transactions 
under sfas no 
 if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring as originally set forth in the hedge documentation  the financial instruments must be marked to market each period with the change in fair market value recorded in earnings 
however  sfas no 
does not allow us to mark to market the change in value of the related underlying physical transaction  and this difference creates earnings volatility when the spreads move 
we expect these net mark to market losses to be predominantly offset when the related physical transactions are settled refer also to the discussion included in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our marketing segment accounted for million of operating income  a decrease of million compared with million contributed in operating income in for our marketing segment included a loss of million associated with financial natural gas basis swap transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the unqualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value will continue to impact the income statement until the derivative financial instruments are settled 
in  the loss associated with unqualified derivatives was million 
our marketing segment was also impacted by lower unit margins on natural gas volumes purchased due to physical pipeline constraints 
performance of the marketing segment was also negatively impacted by demand charges on new third party pipeline capacity that is utilized to transport natural gas from markets that are over supplied with natural gas in our natural gas segment to new markets 
pricing in our natural gas supply markets is expected to come under increasing pressure due to higher natural gas supplies from the rocky mountains and north texas 
for this reason we have increased our commitments on third party pipelines to provide more attractive market outlets for our natural gas supply 
corporate year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million in compared with million in the increases are the result of higher debt balances and higher weighted average interest rates of approximately for the year ended december   compared with approximately during the increase in our debt balances at december  is due to the gathering and processing assets in north texas we acquired in january  in addition to the capital expenditures we have made to expand our existing systems to improve the service capabilities of our assets 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million in compared with million in the million increase in compared with reflects higher average borrowings  partially offset by a decrease in our average borrowing rates 
included in our results for the year ended december  was a charge related to rate refunds payable on kpc for million associated with rates charged to customers of kpc prior to our ownership 
we extinguished this obligation in the first quarter of and have not incurred any similar rate refunds during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources general we believe that our ability to generate cash flow  in addition to our access to capital is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating growth and investment needs 
our primary cash requirements consist of normal operating expenses  maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  debt service payments  distributions to our partners and acquisitions of new assets and businesses  and payments associated with our derivative transactions 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments and quarterly distributions to our partners  are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
margin requirements associated with our derivative transactions are generally supported by letters of credit issued under our credit facility 
we expect to fund long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions from several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under the commercial paper program we established in april  our credit facility  and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of any such offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates  our financial condition and credit rating at the time 
during  we shifted our business strategy to an emphasis on developing and expanding our existing liquids and natural gas businesses with less focus on acquisitions 
the internal growth projects we have planned for our natural gas business see natural gas segment future prospects  coupled with the southern access program on our lakehead system see liquids segment future prospects  will require significant expenditures of capital over the next several years 
we expect to fund these expenditures from a balanced combination of additional issuances of partnership capital and long term debt 
our planned internal growth projects will require us to bear the cost of constructing these new assets before we will begin to realize a return on them 
while these major projects are under construction  our ability to increase distributions  while funding these projects is likely to be limited 
capital resources equity capital our ability to execute our growth strategy and complete our planned construction projects is dependent upon our access to the capital necessary to fund these projects 
during  we raised net proceeds of approximately million from public offerings of our common units  including million from our general partner to maintain its percent general partner interest 
we primarily used the proceeds from these offerings to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility and our commercial paper program which were initially used to finance our capital expansion projects and acquisitions

available credit a significant source of our liquidity is provided by the commercial paper market 
in april  we established a million commercial paper program that is supported by our long term credit facility 
we access the commercial paper market primarily to provide temporary financing for our operating activities  capital expenditures and acquisitions  at rates that are generally lower than the rates available under our credit facility 
under the terms of our commercial paper program  we may issue up to million of commercial paper 
however  the amount of commercial paper we may issue is reduced by any balance of outstanding letters of credit in excess of million 
at december   we had million in principal amount of commercial paper outstanding and could issue million in principal amount of commercial paper 
our credit facility also provides us with another significant source of liquidity 
we amended our credit facility twice during  to among other things  extend the maturity to april  increase the letter of credit sub limit to million  increase the available commitments to million with the right to request  subject to approval by the board of directors of enbridge management  an increase in commitments available up to an aggregate principal amount of billion  decrease the applicable rate as set forth in the credit facility  and extend to december  the requirement to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility  of not more than the amounts we may borrow under the terms of our credit facility are reduced by the principal amount of our commercial paper issuances and the balance of our letters of credit outstanding 
at december   no amounts had been borrowed against our credit facility and we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
we could borrow million under the terms of our credit facility

we access the commercial paper market primarily to provide temporary financing for our operating activities  capital expenditures and acquisitions  at rates that are generally lower than the rates available under our credit facility 
we repaid the entire amount previously outstanding under our credit facility with proceeds we obtained from issuing commercial paper under this program 
our credit facility remains undrawn and available to support our commercial paper program 
under the terms of our commercial paper program  we can issue up to million of commercial paper 
however  the amount of commercial paper we may issue is reduced by any balance of outstanding letters of credit in excess of million 
at december   we had million in principal amount of commercial paper outstanding  with unamortized discount of million  at a weighted average interest rate of and outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
at december   we could issue an additional million in principal amount under our commercial paper program 
credit facility our credit facility  as amended  is a five year term facility that matures in april with a current borrowing capacity of million and a letter of credit sub limit of million 
subject to the approval of enbridge management s board of directors  we have the right to request an increase in commitments available under the credit facility up to an aggregate outstanding principal amount of billion 
we pay interest on the amounts outstanding at variable rates equal to the base rate or a eurodollar rate as defined in the credit facility 
in the case of eurodollar rate loans  an additional margin is charged which varies depending on our credit rating and the amounts drawn under the facility 
we are also charged a facility fee on the entire amount of the credit facility  regardless of the amount drawn  which also varies depending on our credit rating 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of times and a maximum leverage ratio of times for twelve months through december  at which time it decreases to times  thereafter 
at december   our interest coverage ratio was approximately and our leverage ratio was approximately our credit facility also places limitations on the debt that our subsidiaries may incur directly 
accordingly  it is expected that we will provide debt financing to our subsidiaries as necessary 
at december   we had no balances outstanding under our credit facility and letters of credit totaling million 
the amounts we may borrow under the terms of our credit facility are reduced by the principal amount of our commercial paper issuances and the balance of our letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we could borrow million under the terms of our credit facility 
first mortgage notes the first mortgage notes are collateralized by a first mortgage on substantially all of the property  plant and equipment of the lakehead partnership and are due and payable in equal annual installments of million until their maturity in the notes contain various restrictive covenants applicable to us  and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including compliance with certain debt issuance tests 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we believe these issuance tests will not negatively affect our ability to finance future expansion projects 
under the first mortgage note agreements  we cannot make cash distributions more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to exceed available cash for the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
if we repay the notes prior to their stated maturities  the first mortgage note agreements provide for the payment of a redemption premium by us 
senior notes our senior notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities  including trade payables of our subsidiaries 
the borrowings under these notes are non recourse to our general partner and enbridge management 
these notes are subject to make whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants that restrict our ability  with certain exceptions  to sell  convey  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to any person  except in accordance with our indenture agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we did not issue any senior notes during the year ended december  however  for the year ended december   we made the following senior note issuances in december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under bank credit facility 
in january  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding debt under bank credit facility 
all of our senior notes represent our unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
our senior notes are effectively junior in right of payment to any secured indebtedness that we may have and to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries  which own all of our operating assets 
additionally  all of our senior notes pay interest semi annually and have varying maturities and terms as presented in the table above 
our senior notes do not contain any covenants restricting us from issuing additional indebtedness 
loans from general partner and affiliates as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in debt outstanding under a note to an affiliate of our general partner 
this note relates to debt we assumed in connection with our acquisition of the midcoast system in october the note matures in and has cross default provisions that are triggered by events of default under our first mortgage notes or defaults under our credit facility 
the note is subordinate to our credit facility and other senior indebtedness 
for the years ended december  and  we converted interest payable related to this note in the amount of million and million  respectively  into long term debt

the transportation service obligations represent the minimum payment amounts for firm transportation capacity we have reserved on third party pipelines 
cash requirements for future growth capital spending we expect to make significant expenditures during the next three years for the construction of additional natural gas and crude oil transportation infrastructure 
extensive volume growth in the areas served by our east texas system necessitates the construction of additional pipeline capacity to transport these volumes to alternate natural gas markets 
additionally  anticipated growth in western canadian oil sands production and the need to reach newer markets has prompted the southern access project on our lakehead system 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on these projects with the expectation of realizing additional cash flows as these projects are completed and placed in service 
at december   we had million in estimated outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment during we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and includes the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
in  we anticipate our capital expenditures to approximate the following in millions system enhancements core maintenance activities southern access expansion east texas expansion including major expansion projects and excluding acquisitions  ongoing capital expenditures are expected to be significant over the next three years due to the east texas expansion and southern access projects 
core maintenance capital is also anticipated to increase over that period of time due to growth in our pipeline systems and aging of infrastructure 
we anticipate funding the system enhancement capital expenditures temporarily through the issuance of commercial paper  borrowing under the terms of our credit facility  with permanent debt and equity funding being obtained when appropriate 
core maintenance expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
the southern access and east texas expansion projects have strong support from shippers  and upon completion each project will have stable cash flows 
we have received indications that these projects can be readily financed 
we are currently in discussions with our commercial bankers to structure and implement bridge credit facilities that will be required to finance the construction 
this incremental bridge credit capacity may also be used to support a temporary expansion of our commercial paper program 
the bridge credit facilities will be refinanced with permanent capital at key milestone dates for each project 
we expect to incur continuing annual capital and operating expenditures for pipeline integrity measures to ensure both regulatory compliance and to maintain the overall integrity of our pipeline systems 
expenditure levels have continued to increase as pipelines age and require higher levels of inspection or maintenance  however  these are viewed to be consistent with industry trends 
acquisitions we continue to assess various acquisition and expansion opportunities to pursue our strategy for growth 
however  the market for acquiring energy transportation assets is active and competition among prospective acquirers of assets has been significant 
while we remain committed to making accretive acquisitions in or near areas where we already operate or have a competitive advantage  we will continue to focus our efforts on development of our existing pipeline systems 
additionally  we may pursue opportunities to divest of any non strategic assets as conditions warrant 
we expect that the funds needed to achieve growth through acquisitions will be obtained through issuances of commercial paper  term debt and additional partnership interests 
derivative activities we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows and manage the purchase and sales prices of our commodities 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or anticipated transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices 
the following table provides summarized information about the timing and expected settlement amounts of our outstanding commodity derivative financial instruments at december  for each of the indicated calendar years notional dollars in millions swaps natural gas ngl crude options calls natural gas options puts natural gas totals notional amounts for natural gas are recorded in millions of british thermal units mmbtu 
notional amounts for ngl and crude are recorded in barrels bbl 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with million in improved operating cash flow was the result of operating income contributions from the gathering and processing assets we acquired in north texas  which was partially offset by lower deliveries on the lakehead system 
the remaining changes in cash from operating activities were due to changes in the operating assets and liabilities from increased natural gas prices in and general timing differences in the collection on and payment of our current accounts 
investing activities net cash used in our investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the prior year 
the million increase in funds utilized in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following items the dollar value of our acquisitions in was higher compared with  effectively increasing our cash outflows by million 
during  we acquired natural gas gathering and processing assets in north texas for million  a natural gas pipeline with interconnects to our anadarko system for million  and other small assets for million 
in our asset acquisitions primarily consisted of our mid continent and palo duro assets and several other smaller assets for million 
we also had increased cash outflows associated with expansion and growth opportunities of existing assets during of million  as compared to during  we spent million for capital expenditures including core maintenance and enhancement projects compared to million in our core maintenance capital expenditures increased to million for compared with million for  due to the expansion and growth of our existing assets 
our enhancement capital spending increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the mile expansion of our east texas system  which was completed in june  and several smaller projects to expand our existing natural gas transmission and processing capacity  and increase our crude oil storage facilities in the mid continent market 
in december  we sold for million in cash a processing plant and related facilities and other gathering and processing assets located in our east and south texas systems with a carrying value of approximately million 
we incurred selling costs of approximately million and recognized a gain on the sale of approximately million 
the facilities we sold represent non strategic assets within our natural gas segment 
in connection with this sale  we paid approximately million to settle natural gas and ngl hedges associated with the natural gas and ngl produced by these assets 
we had previously recognized unrealized losses associated with the natural gas hedges that were realized upon settlement 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared with million in the decrease in cash provided by financing activities of million is attributable to a greater amount of distributions to our partners  no new issuances of senior notes during  offset by a larger amount of proceeds received from unit issuances and increased net issuances of commercial paper and fewer net repayments on the credit facility 
during  we had net commercial paper issuances of million program which include gross issuances of  million and gross repayments of  million 
we began utilizing the commercial paper program in april we used proceeds from our issuances of commercial paper to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we made net repayments of million on our credit facility including borrowings and repayments of million representing net non cash settlements with the parties to our credit facility 
during  we made net repayments of million on our credit facility including borrowings and repayments of  million representing net non cash settlements with the parties to our credit facility 
additionally during  we received proceeds of million  excluding issuance costs and discounts totaling million  from the issuance of million in aggregate principle amount of our senior notes 
we used a portion of the proceeds from our senior note issuance to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facilities which we initially borrowed to fund our capital expenditures for expansion projects and acquisitions 
we have historically borrowed on our credit facility for short term operating activities and to fund capital expenditures for expansion projects and acquisitions 
however  in the second quarter of we began issuing commercial paper as a more economical source of short term capital than our credit facility 
during and  we also repaid million on our first mortgage notes 
during  we also received approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of million class a common units  compared to net proceeds of million from the issuance of million class a common units in cash distributions to partners increased to million in from million in due to an increase in the number of units outstanding  and an increase in the general partner incentive distributions  as a result of the increased cash distributions to our common unitholders 
cash distributions we make quarterly distributions to our general partner and the holders of our common units  an amount equal to our available cash  which generally is defined to mean for any calendar quarter the sum of all of our cash receipts plus net reductions to reserves less all of our cash disbursements and net changes to reserves 
these reserves are retained to provide for the proper conduct of our business  to stabilize distributions of cash to unitholders and the general partner and  as necessary  to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations 
enbridge management  as the delegate of the general partner under a delegation of control agreement  computes the amount of our available cash 
enbridge management  as owner of our i units  does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that we make a cash distribution to the general partner and the holders of our common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of total units in us owned by enbridge management increases automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the number of enbridge management s shares and voting shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase in i units is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the trading day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares multiplied by the number of shares outstanding on the record date 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units that are issued when a distribution of cash is made to the general partner and owners of common units is treated as distribution of available cash  even though the i unit holder will not receive cash 
we retain the cash for use in our operations 
during  we distributed a total of  i units through quarterly distributions to enbridge management  compared with  in we retained million in related to the i unit distributions compared with million in we expect our annual cash distribution rate for fiscal year to remain consistent with the declared annual distribution per unit rate of for the years ended december  and we expect that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long term  however  from time to time  we may temporarily borrow under our credit facility for the purpose of paying cash distributions until the full impact of assets being developed on operations is realized 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
subsequent events cash distribution on january   enbridge management s board of directors declared a distribution payable to our partners on february  the distribution was paid to unitholders of record as of february   of our available cash of million at december   or per common unit 
of this distribution  million was paid in cash  million was distributed in i units to i unit holders and million was retained from the general partner in respect of this i unit distribution 
critical accounting policies and estimates our selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued 
accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical 
however  not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in such cases  we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and accurately present the substance of these situations 
we accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations 
in addition to the above  certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for our estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  actual results can and often do differ from these estimates 
any effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
each of these areas involves complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the audit  finance risk committee of enbridge management s board of directors 
revenue recognition and the use of estimates for revenues and cost of natural gas in general  we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our natural gas business  we must estimate our current month revenue and cost of natural gas to permit the timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we generally cannot compile actual billing information nor obtain actual vendor invoices within a timeframe that would permit the recording of this actual data prior to preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we record an estimate each month for our operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on the best available volume and price data for natural gas delivered and received  along with a true up of the prior month s estimate to equal the prior month s actual data 
as a result  there is one month of estimated data recorded in our operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each of the years ended december   and we believe that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the stability of our processes 
capitalization policies  depreciation methods and impairment of property  plant and equipment we capitalize expenditures related to property  plant and equipment  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are extended  replaced or improved  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisitions of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
during construction  we capitalize direct costs  such as labor and materials  and other costs  such as direct overhead and interest at our weighted average cost of debt  and  in our regulated businesses that apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  or sfas no 
 an equity return component 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and include the replacement of system components and equipment that are worn  obsolete or near the end of their useful lives 
examples of core maintenance expenditures include valve automation programs  cathodic protection  zero hour compression overhauls and electrical switchgear replacement programs 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of our existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
examples of enhancement expenditures include first time high resolution integrity tool runs  the costs associated with installation of seals  liners and other equipment to reduce the risk of environmental contamination from crude oil storage tanks  costs of sleeving a major segment of the pipeline system following an integrity tool run  natural gas or crude oil well connects  natural gas plants and pipeline construction and expansion 
recent regulatory guidance issued by the ferc will require us to expense certain costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
under this guidance  beginning in january  costs to prepare a plan to implement the program  identify high consequence areas  develop and maintain a record keeping system and inspect  test and report on the condition of affected pipeline segments to determine the need for repairs or replacements  are required to be expensed 
we are adopting this guidance prospectively for our sfas no 
companies only  namely  our utos  midla  alatenn and kpc natural gas transmission systems 
consistent with our prior practice  costs of modifying pipelines to permit in line inspections  certain costs associated with developing or enhancing computer software and costs associated with remedial mitigation actions to correct an identified condition will continue to be capitalized for our ferc regulated and non regulated pipeline systems 
additionally  for our non regulated pipelines and our ferc regulated crude oil pipelines that are not eligible to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 we will continue to capitalize first time crack detection tool runs and hydrostatic testing costs conducted for the purposes of detecting manufacturing or construction defects  consistent with our historical policy 
subsequent work of this nature is expensed as incurred 
our ferc regulated crude oil pipelines will expense items listed above for regulatory reporting purposes 
we do not expect our implementation of this regulation to significantly affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we record property  plant and equipment at its original cost and depreciate our assets over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the estimated remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins the assets serve using the group method 
our determination of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
we routinely utilize consultants and other experts to assist us in assessing the remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins we serve 
we record depreciation using the group method of depreciation which is commonly used by pipelines  utilities and similar entities 
under the group method  for all segments  upon the disposition of property  plant and equipment  the cost less net proceeds is normally charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss on disposal is recognized 
however  when a significant separately identifiable group of assets  such as a processing plant  treating facility or a pipeline system are sold  we will recognize a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income for the difference between the cash received and the net book value of the assets sold 
changes in any of our assumptions may alter the rate at which we recognize depreciation in our consolidated financial statements 
at regular intervals  we retain the services of independent consultants to assist us with assessing the reasonableness of the useful lives we have established for the property  plant and equipment of our major systems 
based on the results of these regular assessments we may make modifications to the assumptions we use to determine our depreciation rates 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets 
we continually monitor our businesses and the market and business environments to identify indicators that may suggest an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the asset for recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from operating the asset 
these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating cost and other factors 
we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable 
the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations 
any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually as of the end of the second quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at the time we determine that impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the goodwill is written down to its fair value 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about future cash flows  as well as revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital expenditures and net working capital based on assumptions that are consistent with our most recent five year plan  which we use to manage the business 
preparation of forecast information for use in our five year plan involves significant judgments 
actual results can  and often do  differ from the projections and assumptions we make in preparing these forecasts 
these changes can have a negative impact on our estimates of impairment  which could result in charges to income 
in addition  further changes in the economic and business environment can affect our original and ongoing assessments of potential impairment 
other intangible assets consist of natural gas purchase and sale customer contracts  and natural gas supply opportunities  which we amortize on a straight line basis over the weighted average useful life of the underlying assets  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of the intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles  the intangibles are written down to their fair value 
if there are changes to any of our estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
asset retirement obligations the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  require us to record a liability for the fair value of our asset retirement obligations  on a discounted basis  in the period in which the liability is incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed or acquired  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the provisions also require that we capitalize the costs associated with the asset retirement obligations as part of the carrying cost of the related assets 
we recognize an ongoing expense for the interest component of the liability as part of depreciation expense resulting from changes in the value of the retirement obligation due to the passage of time 
we depreciate the initial capitalized costs over the useful lives of the related assets 
we extinguish the liabilities for asset retirement obligations when assets are taken out of service or otherwise abandoned 
the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin require us to recognize a liability and related asset  consistent with sfas no 
 for the fair value of conditional asset retirement obligations that we can reasonably estimate 
fin also provides specific guidance regarding when an asset retirement obligation is reasonably estimable including when sufficient information is available to apply an expected present value technique 
our implementation of fin did not have a material impact effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have legal obligations requiring us to decommission our offshore pipeline systems at retirement 
in certain rate jurisdictions  we are permitted to include annual charges for removal costs in the regulated cost of service rates we charge our customers 
additionally  legal obligations exist for a minority of our onshore right of way agreements due to requirements or landowner options to compel us to remove the pipe at final abandonment 
sufficient data exists with certain onshore pipeline systems to reasonably estimate an abandonment retirement obligation cost 
however  in some cases  there is insufficient information to reasonably determine the timing and or method of settlement for estimating the fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
in these cases  the asset retirement obligation cost is considered indeterminate because there is no data or information that can be derived from past practice  industry practice  management s intent  or the asset s estimated economic life 
useful lives of most pipeline systems are primarily derived from available supply resources and ultimate consumer refinery consumption 
variables can affect the remaining lives of the assets which preclude us from making a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation 
indeterminate asset retirement obligation costs will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate potential settlement dates and methods 
derivative financial instruments our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices of natural gas  ngls  condensate and fractionation margins 
to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows  we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the purchase and sales prices of the commodities and fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt 
the accounting treatment for our derivative financial instruments is determined by the guidance of sfas no 
and is dependent on each instrument s intended use  how it is designated and the extent to which the derivative financial instrument is effective in hedging the risk that it is intended to mitigate 
to qualify for hedge accounting  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment that we use can be divided into two categories cash flow hedges  or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges are entered to hedge the variability in cash flows related to a forecasted transaction 
fair value hedges are entered to hedge the value of a recognized asset or liability 
cash flow and fair value hedges are considered highly effective if they are able to substantially offset ie  more than percent the changes in cash flow or fair value of the risk that is being hedged 
the extent to which a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge does not offset the changes in cash flow or fair value of the risk being hedged is considered ineffective 
at inception and on an ongoing basis we assess whether the derivative financial instruments we use in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged items 
all of our derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value as current and long term assets or liabilities on a net basis by counterparty and are adjusted each period for changes in the fair market value 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  taking into account the current unrealized losses or gains on open contracts 
we use external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of the financial instruments we utilize 
derivative financial instruments that we designate and qualify as cash flow or fair value hedges under the requirements of sfas no 
 receive hedge accounting treatment for the effective portion of the derivative financial instrument 
under hedge accounting  any unrealized gain or loss in fair market value of the effective portion of a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as an asset or liability with an offset deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income oci  a component of partners capital  until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases and sales are included in cost of natural gas and cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments are included in interest on our consolidated statements of income in the period the hedged transaction occurs 
under hedge accounting  the realized and unrealized gain or loss in the fair market value of a derivative financial instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recorded as an asset or a liability with the offset recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of natural gas for fair value hedges of our commodities and as a component of interest expense for fair value hedges of our indebtedness both of which are offset by the changes in the fair market value of the underlying hedged item 
under the guidance of sfas no 
 the changes in fair market value  both realized and unrealized gains and losses  of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  are not designated as hedges and are ineffective  are recognized each period in our consolidated statements of income 
these changes in fair market value are recognized as a component of cost of natural gas for our commodity derivative financial instruments and as a component of interest expense for derivative financial instruments of our interest rates 
we refer to the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as mark to market accounting 
our preference  whenever possible  is for our derivative financial instruments to receive hedge accounting treatment to mitigate the noncash earnings volatility that arises under mark to market accounting treatment 
our cash flow is only affected to the extent the actual derivative contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty  or by making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative contract 
typically  a derivative contract is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
gains and losses that we have deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued  remain in oci until the underlying physical transaction occurs unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
one of the primary factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions we use to value our derivative financial instruments 
to the extent that these derivative financial instruments are ineffective or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the requirements of sfas no 
 they are accounted for using the mark to market method of accounting and any change in the fair market value is reflected in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of natural gas or interest expense  depending on whether the derivative financial instrument relates to a commodity or interest rate 
we use published market price information where available  or quotations from otc market makers to find executable bids and offers 
the valuations also reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  modeling risk  credit risk of our counterparties and operational risk 
the amounts we report in our consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
commitments  contingencies and environmental liabilities we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities  including environmental remediation and clean up costs  when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors  and include estimates of associated legal costs 
these estimates also consider prior experience remediating contaminated sites  other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations 
our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances and any revisions are reflected in our earnings in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from our liability and  when recovery is reasonably assured  we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
new environmental developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and new claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from our current or past operations  could result in substantial cost and future liabilities 
we recognize liabilities for other contingencies when we have an exposure that  when fully analyzed  indicates it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated 
both internal and external legal counsel evaluate our potential exposure to adverse outcomes 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  we accrue the most likely amount  or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to review our estimates  income may be affected 
oil over short balance and oil measurement gains losses oil over short balance and oil measurement gains losses are inherent in the transportation of crude oil due to evaporation  measurement differences and blending of commodities in transit in addition to other factors 
we estimate our oil measurement gains losses and our oil over short balance based on mathematical calculations and physical measurements  which include assumptions about the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
a material change in these assumptions may result in a change to the carrying value of our oil over short balance or revision of our oil measurement gain loss estimates 
we include the oil measurement gains losses in our operating and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and the oil over short balance in accounts payable and other in the consolidated statements of financial position if the balance is a liability and in inventory if the balance is in an asset position 
operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances we record payables and receivables associated with our natural gas pipeline operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances monthly when a customer delivers more or less natural gas into our pipelines than they remove 
these balances are either settled on a cash basis or are carried by the pipelines and shippers on an in kind basis 
we primarily estimate the value of the imbalances at month end spot prices based on published third party indices for the locations where the imbalances are derived using the best available third party and internal volume information 
if there is a change to these estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
recent accounting developments accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
under this statement  voluntary changes in accounting principle are required to be applied retrospectively for the direct effects of a change to prior periods financial statements  unless such application is impracticable 
retrospective application refers to reflecting a change in accounting principle in the financial statements of prior periods as if the principle had always been used 
when retrospective application is determined to be impracticable  this statement requires the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective treatment is practicable with a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
this statement retains the guidance in apb opinion no 
for reporting the corrections of errors and changes in accounting estimates 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
our adoption of this statement will affect our consolidated financial statements for any changes in accounting principle we may make in the future  and new pronouncements we adopt that do not provide transition provisions 
ferc guidance on accounting for integrity management costs in june  the ferc issued guidance describing how ferc regulated companies should account for costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
under the guidance  costs to prepare a plan to implement the program  identify high consequence areas  develop and maintain a record keeping system and inspect  test and report on the condition of affected pipeline segments to determine the need for repairs or replacements  are required to be expensed 
costs of modifying pipelines to permit in line inspections  certain costs associated with developing or enhancing computer software and costs associated with remedial and mitigation actions to correct an identified condition can be capitalized 
the guidance is effective january   and will be applied prospectively to our sfas no 
companies 
we do not expect our implementation of this regulation to significantly affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable interest rate debt  and are exposed to market risk resulting from the variable interest rates on our credit facility and the frequent changes in interest rates when we re issue maturing commercial paper 
to the extent that we frequently issue and re issue commercial paper at short term interest rates and have amounts drawn under our credit facilities at floating rates of interest  our earnings and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is managed through periodically refinancing commercial paper and floating rate bank debt with long term fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
we do not have any material exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates as virtually all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that a material foreign exchange exposure arises  we intend to hedge such exposure using derivative financial instruments 
the table below summarizes the carrying value and fair value of our third party debt obligations and interest rate derivative financial instruments as of december  and for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts  the rates charged on the underlying notional and weighted average interest rates paid by expected maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

the floating to fixed rate and fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps maturing in do not qualify as cash flow or fair value hedges and as a result  changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
commodity price risk our net income and cash flows are also subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices of natural gas  ngls  condensate and fractionation margins the relative price differential between ngl sales and offsetting natural gas purchases 
this market price exposure exists within our natural gas and marketing segments 
to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows  we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the purchase and sales prices of the commodities 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or anticipated transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices

accounting treatment all derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value and are adjusted each period for changes in the fair market value mark to market 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  taking into account the current unrealized losses or gains on open contracts 
we use external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of the financial instruments we utilize 
under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative transactions and hedging activities sfas no 
 if a derivative financial instrument does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  a change in the fair market value  both realized and unrealized  is recognized currently in our income statement as a derivative fair value gain loss and is recorded in cost of natural gas for commodity derivatives and interest expense for interest rate derivatives 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual derivative contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty or by making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative contract 
typically  a derivative contract is settled when the future physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs eg  purchase or sale of natural gas or interest payment 
if a derivative financial instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting  a change in the fair market value is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income oci  a component of partners capital  until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in fair market value is recognized each period in earnings 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are included in cost of natural gas in the period the hedged transaction occurs 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued  remain in oci until the underlying physical transaction occurs unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
our preference  whenever possible  is for our derivative financial instruments to receive hedge accounting treatment to mitigate the noncash earnings volatility that arises under mark to market accounting treatment 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
if a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge of the change in fair market value of an underlying asset or liability  the gain loss resulting from the change in fair market value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded in earnings adjusted by the gain loss resulting from the change in fair market value of the underlying asset or liability 
any ineffective portion of a fair value hedge s change in fair market value will be recorded in earnings as the amount that is not offset by the gain loss on the change in fair market value of the underlying asset or liability 
we include the gains and losses associated with derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges of our debt obligations in interest expense 
similar to derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
non qualified hedges many of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific requirements of sfas no 
however  we have three primary instances where the hedge structure does not meet the requirements to apply hedge accounting and  therefore  these financial instruments are considered non qualified under sfas no 
these non qualified derivative financial instruments must be adjusted to their fair market value  or marked to market  each period  with the increases and decreases in fair value recorded as increases and decreases in cost of natural gas in our consolidated statements of income 
these mark to market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility that can often be significant from period to period  but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices 
the cash flow impact occurs when the underlying physical transaction takes place in the future and an associated financial instrument contract settlement is made 
the three instances of non qualified hedges are as follows transportation in our marketing segment  when the pricing index used for gas sales is different from the pricing index used for gas purchases  we are exposed to relative changes in those two indices 
by entering into a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in the margin on the combined gas purchase and gas sale  removing any market price risk on the physical transactions 
although this represents a sound economic hedging strategy  these types of derivative transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 as the ultimate cash flow has not been fixed  only the margin 
storage in our marketing segment  when we use derivative financial instruments to hedge market spreads around our owned or contracted assets  such as our gas storage portfolio  the underlying forecasted transaction may or may not occur in the same period as originally forecast 
this can occur because we have the flexibility to make these changes in the underlying injection or withdrawal schedule  given changes in market conditions 
therefore  these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 as the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring as originally set forth in the hedge documentation established at the inception of the hedge 
natural gas collars in our natural gas segment  we had previously entered into natural gas collars to hedge the sales price of natural gas 
the natural gas collars were based on a nymex price  while the physical gas sales were based on a different index 
to better align the index of the natural gas collars with the index of the underlying sales  we de designated the original hedging relationship with the intent of contemporaneously re designating the natural gas collars as hedges of physical natural gas sales with a nymex pricing index to better match the indices  which was a sound economic hedging strategy 
however  because the fair value of these derivative instruments was a liability to us at re designation  they are considered net written options under sfas no 
and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are now accounted for in the consolidated statements of income through mark to market accounting  with the changes in fair value from the date of de designation recorded to earnings each period 
as a result  our operating income will be subject to greater volatility due to movements in the prices of natural gas until the underlying long term transactions are settled 
in each of the instances described above  the underlying physical purchase  storage and sale of natural gas and ngls are accounted for on a historical cost basis rather than on the mark to market basis we utilize for the derivatives used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage and transportation assets 
this difference in accounting ie  the financial side of the transaction is recorded at fair market values while the physical side of the transaction is not can and has resulted in volatility in our reported net income  even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
discontinuance of hedge accounting during the second quarter of  we discontinued application of hedge accounting in connection with some of our derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of forecasted sales and purchases of natural gas 
we discontinued application of hedge accounting when we determined it was no longer probable that the originally forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas would occur by the end of the originally specified time period  or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
as discussed above  this can occur because we have the flexibility to make changes to the underlying delivery points for our transportation assets and to the underlying injection or withdrawal schedule for our storage assets  given changes in market conditions 
one of the key criteria to achieve hedge accounting under sfas no 
is that the forecasted transaction be probable of occurring as originally set forth in the hedge documentation 
as a result  during the second quarter of  we recognized previously deferred unrealized losses in our marketing segment of approximately million from the discontinuance of hedge accounting 
in doing so  we reclassified the million to cost of natural gas on our consolidated statements of income from oci 
going forward  the discontinued derivative financial instruments are considered to be non qualified under sfas no 
 and must be marked to market each period  with the increases and decreases in fair value recorded as increases and decreases in earnings 
also included in the loss from discontinuance are approximately million of net mark to market losses that relate to hedge positions that were closed out during the second quarter 
the following table presents the unrealized losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivatives  which are recorded as an element of cost of natural gas in our consolidated statements of income and disclosed as a reconciling item on our statements of cash flows derivative fair value losses december  december  december  in millions natural gas segment ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges discontinuance derivative fair value losses de designation and settlement of derivatives in connection with the sale of assets  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we settled for cash of approximately million  natural gas collars representing derivative financial instruments on sales of  mmbtu d of natural gas through we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with these natural gas collars that were realized upon settlement
