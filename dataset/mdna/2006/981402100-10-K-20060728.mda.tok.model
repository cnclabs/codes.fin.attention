overview we are a provider of services and web based software for human capital management hcm 
hcm is the process by which companies recruit  train  evaluate  motivate  develop and retain their employees 
we offer software and services that address the needs of companies to more effectively manage their human capital management function 
we believe that our one stop shopping approach for our clients hcm needs is more efficient and effective than traditional methods of human resource management 
we have two distinct operating segments  which are the enterprise workforce services and career networks segments 
the enterprise workforce services segment primarily consists of hcm software  professional services and products sold as part of reward and discount programs 
specifically  our enterprise workforce services segment offers a complete suite of hcm software solutions  which address recruitment  benefits  performance  compensation  development and rewards 
the career networks segment consists of career transition  applicant sourcing and recruitment research services 
our business changed significantly beginning in fiscal during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of paula allen holdings  omnipartners  figurejobs 
com  rezlogic  resumexpress and tech engine 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of icarian  purecarbon and xylo 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of perform  peopleview and kadiri 
during fiscal  we completed the acquisitions of peoplebonus  bravanta  hrsoft and proact 
during fiscal  we acquired exxceed  inc these acquisitions have enabled us to expand and enhance our hcm software  increase our service offerings and increase our revenue streams 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we have concentrated on integrating the acquired entities  expanding the reach of the existing business and identifying other potential acquisition targets 
when we complete an acquisition  we combine the business of the acquired entity into the company s existing operations 
we expect that this will significantly reduce the administrative expenses associated with the business prior to the acquisition 
the acquired business is not maintained as a standalone business operation 
therefore  we do not separately account for the acquired business  including its profitability 
rather  it is included in one of our two distinct business segments and is evaluated as part of the entire segment 
to monitor our results of operations and financial condition  we review key financial information including net revenues  gross profit  earnings per share  and cash flow from operations 
as acquired entities are integrated and our business evolves  we continue to seek methods to more efficiently monitor and manage our business performance 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  the assessment of goodwill impairment  the valuation of acquired intangible assets  the assessment of intangible asset impairment and the valuation of deferred tax assets and related allowances 
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the value of assets and the reported amounts of revenues 
changes in assumptions used would impact our financial position and results 
the company derives revenue from various sources including the following subscription and hosting fees  licensing of software  software maintenance fees  professional services related to software implementation  customization and training  sale of products and tickets through the company s employee discount and rewards software module  career transition services  recruitment research services  and  applicant sourcing 
in general  the company recognizes revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met  which is typically when evidence of an arrangement exists services have been provided or goods have been delivered the price is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured 
the company sells various hcm software applications and also provides these applications as an on demand application service 
revenue is generated through a variety of contractual arrangements 
subscription and hosting fees and software maintenance fees are billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
quarterly and annual payments are deferred and recognized monthly over the service period on a straight line basis 
set up fees are deferred and recognized monthly on a straight line basis over the contractual lives  which approximates the expected lives of the customer relationships 
hosting revenues consist of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service 
the company follows the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company allocates the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
professional services included in an application services arrangement with multiple deliverables are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable of the arrangement 
when accounted for separately  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered 
license revenues consist of fees earned from the granting of licenses to use the software products 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  when all of the following conditions are met a signed contract exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and the company believes that the collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
license revenue is recorded upon delivery with an appropriate deferral for maintenance services  if applicable  provided all of the other relevant conditions have been met 
the total fee from the arrangement is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements 
maintenance agreements are typically priced based on a percentage of the product license fee and have a one year term  renewable annually 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is established based on the stated renewal rates 
services provided to customers under maintenance agreements include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades 
vsoe of fair value for the professional service element is based on the standard hourly rates the company charges for services when such services are sold separately 
professional services revenue is generated from implementation and customization of software and from training and general consulting 
in addition  revenue is generated from technical support not included in the software maintenance 
the majority of professional services revenue is billed based on an hourly rate and recognized on a monthly basis as services are provided 
for certain contracts which involve significant implementation or other services which are essential to the functionality of the software and which are reasonably estimable  the license and implementation services revenue is recognized using contract accounting  as prescribed by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized over the period of each implementation using the percentage of completion method 
labor hours incurred is used as the measure of progress towards completion  and management believes its estimates to completion are reasonably dependable 
a provision for estimated losses on engagements is made in the period in which the losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
one of the software applications offered by the company allows customer companies to offer rewards and benefits discounted goods and tickets in an effort to promote their employee retention 
the company generates subscription revenues from the customer company 
in addition  the company generates revenue from the sale of products and tickets to the customers employees through a website

the company recognizes revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met  which is typically when the services have been completed 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we assess goodwill related to reporting units for impairment and write down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
we have two distinct reporting units enterprise workforce services and career networks 
each reporting unit represents a distinct business unit that offers different products and services 
management monitors each unit separately 
enterprise workforce services  which includes revenue from software and related services  is a developing business unit  whereas career networks is a more established business unit 
we estimate the fair value of each business unit by preparing a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate 
the model is prepared by projecting results for five years making different assumptions for each reporting unit 
for the calculation done at the end of fiscal  we estimated that individual reporting unit annual revenue growth rates would range from to  that gross profit would increase slightly  and that operating expenses would increase but would decrease as a percentage of revenues 
we estimated the terminal rate as a multiple of revenue after the fifth year to be between and an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
changes in the discount rate used  or in other assumptions in the model  would result in wide fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
any such changes may result in additional impairment write downs 
we value acquired intangible assets  which includes acquired technologies  customer base and intellectual property  based on the estimated fair value of the assets at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated fair value is primarily based on projected cash flows associated with the assets and the customer attrition rates 
different assumptions were used in estimating the intangible assets acquired in each business acquisition 
if the future cash flows or the customer attrition rates differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to record an impairment of intangible assets 
changes in circumstances impacting other assumptions used to value intangible assets could also lead to future impairments 
we apply significant judgment in recording deferred tax assets  which primarily are the result of loss carry forwards of companies that we acquired and loss carry forwards internally generated 
in addition  we make certain assumptions about if and when these deferred tax assets will be utilized 
these determinations require estimates of future profits to be forecasted 
actual results may differ from amounts estimated 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues consolidated revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
enterprise workforce services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in revenue was due to the following a  increase in software revenue and a  increase in reward and discount product sales partially offset by a  decrease in professional services revenue 
the increase in software revenue was due to the combination of the increase in revenue subsequent to the various acquisitions in fiscal and peoplebonus  hrsoft  proact and exxceed and revenue generated from existing products 
the increase in rewards and discount revenue was primarily due to the fact that we acquired bravanta in late july so fiscal revenue only included ten months of bravanta related reward product revenue 
career networks revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in recruitment research revenue of  and career transition revenue of  beginning in fourth quarter  management began to reevaluate the recruitment research business in efforts to increase profitability and decided to downsize the workforce 
the downsizing resulted in less recruitment research revenue  and it also resulted in higher revenue per sales person and productivity gains that management anticipates will allow this revenue source to increase in the next fiscal year 
career transition services revenue decreased year over year but showed significant increases in fourth quarter management anticipates this trend to continue in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase in applicant sourcing services of  cost of revenues cost of revenue for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or

selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in selling and marketing expense is due to decreases in employee costs and in advertising expenses in the career networks segment partially offset by the creation of an account management group and a business development unit within enterprise workforce services segment 
the decrease in career networks employee costs reflects the decrease in employees in the career transition services group due to a change in business strategy whereby the focus is on increasing revenue per salesperson while using a smaller  more effective sales force 
the decrease in career networks advertising costs is due to a decrease in the cost of sales leads within the career transition services group as we further leveraged our internal lead generation resources 
the creation of the account management group and a business development unit within enterprise workforce services has increased employee costs and travel expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the net decrease is due to significant reductions in employee costs  bad debt expense  and various other operating expenses partially offset by an increase in professional fees 
the decrease in employee costs reflects the gradual reduction in the number of general and administrative employees subsequent to the various acquisitions 
in addition  certain other expenses  including travel  telephone  internet and software costs  have also gradually decreased subsequent to the acquisitions as the administrative headcount decreases and as the company eliminates redundant services and consolidates providers 
the decrease in bad debt expense reflects the resolution of certain large collection issues for which bad debt was expensed in fiscal and fewer problem receivable balances identified in fiscal the increase in professional fees is due to the use of various consultants for departmental projects as well as the expenses associated with the company s first sas audit 
management continues to investigate additional cost containment opportunities and anticipates continued reductions in certain general and administrative expenses in fiscal research and development research and development expenses were  for fiscal and  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase in research and development expenses during fiscal was a calculated decision by management to invest in further development of the company s software suite 
subsequent to the various acquisitions  we continue to incur costs necessary to update the acquired technology  to standardize the software applications now owned by the company  and to build out the platform 
the increase in research and development expenses reflect the increase in employee costs of approximately  and the increase in professional fees of  as the company uses both internal and external resources

during fiscal  enterprise workforce solutions revenue consisted of software revenue of  professional services revenue of  and rewards and discount product revenue of  career networks revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due to a decrease in career transition services revenue of  during fiscal  we changed our strategy with regards to career transition services whereby we significantly decreased our sales force and focused on higher revenue customers 
this resulted in a decrease in revenues but an increase in revenue per customer 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in applicant sourcing and exchange services revenue of  applicant sourcing and exchange services revenue increased due to a strong executive job market  particularly in financial positions

gross profits were  for fiscal or of revenues compared to  or of revenues for fiscal costs of revenues of the acquired entities was  during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percent of revenues was due to the lower gross profit margins generated by the acquired companies 
the gross profit margins of these companies was lower because the software products required more implementation and customization services  which traditionally had lower margins 
in addition  the rewards and discount product revenue generated subsequent to the bravanta acquisition had lower margins 
finally  several of the acquired companies entered into fixed fee contracts prior to our acquisition  and the costs associated with these contracts were higher than anticipated

the employee costs in the sales force and marketing department in the enterprise workforce services segment increased by approximately million as a result of the various acquisitions 
this increase is partially offset by a decrease in the sales force in the career networks segment as we refocused efforts on increasing revenue per salesperson as opposed to gross revenue

the majority of the downsizing benefit was anticipated to occur with the employee costs included in general and administrative expenses 
travel expense increased in fiscal primarily due to travel required before and after the acquisitions 
professional fees increased primarily due to the legal fees  including those associated with a dispute with the former shareholders of figurejobs

the increase represents an increase of  relating to the acquisition of exxceed in january offset slightly by  in various final purchase price adjustments relating to the bravanta and proact acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at may   we maintained  in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
working capital  which represents current assets less current liabilities  was negative  at may    of short term investments was restricted from use in order to collateralize various borrowing  lease arrangements and a bond 
specifically  these deposits were restricted as security for an outstanding term loan  a line of credit and two letters of guarantee provided to landlords for facility leases 
in the third quarter  an additional certificate of deposit was established to support a bond relating to an on going legal dispute in california 
the dispute was resolved for  which will be paid in fiscal as the outstanding term loan and line of credit balances change  the restricted cash balance guaranteeing them will change accordingly

management believes that operating cash flows will increase in the future as a result of increased revenue and continued decreases in cash expenses 
the significant research and development expenses incurred in fiscal have resulted in new releases in certain product offerings that we believe provide us with high quality software solutions that will ultimately generate gradual increases in revenue 
in addition  career services revenue showed solid increases in the fourth quarter in fiscal  which we believe will continue through fiscal and beyond 
research and development expenses in fiscal totaled  subsequent to this significant investment  management anticipates reductions in research and development expenditures 
in addition  management has identified certain other expenses  most significant being legal expenses  that should decrease 
legal expenses were significant in fiscal and primarily due to legal issues following the various acquisitions 
these issues have been resolved  which should result in a decrease in the related expenses 
many of the costs necessary to consolidate the operations after the various acquisitions of fiscal and should not be recurring in the future 
finally  management is committed to reducing costs to appropriate levels if the projected revenue increases do not materialize 
while management believes that the anticipated improvement in operating cash flows together with our current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least may   we have recently engaged an investment advisor to help us evaluate opportunities such as raising additional capital 
contractual obligations at may  maturities of debt outstanding  capital leases  operating leases and contractual obligations are as follows year ended may  total debt capital leases operating leases total acquisitions as part of our overall strategy  we have pursued growth through the acquisition of other companies offering services similar or complementary to ours

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  accounting for share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements with the cost measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r states that its effective date is for interim periods beginning after june   but the sec deferred the effective date to annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  the company will adopt the new requirements beginning with fiscal  or june  as a result  the company expects to record non cash  stock based compensation expense  which will have a material impact on results of operations 
the full impact is dependent on various factors  including the timing of when new employees are hired  the total number of stock awards granted  and the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant 
had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the total stock based expense for all awards would have approximated the impact of expensing stock awards as described in the financial statement footnote disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb  accounting changes apb  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes in requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retroactive application to prior period financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principles unless it is impracticable 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas carries forward many other provisions of apb without change  including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate  a change in the reporting entity and the correction of an error 
the company will adopt this standard effective june item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and our bank loans 
we invest our surplus cash in an investment trust established by a canadian chartered bank and in a certificate of deposit in a bank in the united states 
the investment trust holds various short term  low risk instruments and can be withdrawn without penalty at any time 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial position 
we have established a cdn  line of credit with a canadian bank which bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
we have drawn cdn  on this facility as of may  we also have a term loan with the bank in the amount of cdn  as of may  the term loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus
