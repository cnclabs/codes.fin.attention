item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
the financial discussion that follows may refer to the effect of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section  business combinations  and note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the detailed financial discussion focuses on results compared to discussion of results compared to is predominantly in section compared to on april   the board of directors declared a for stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  payable may   to shareholders of record at the close of business on may  all share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of this stock split 
management continually evaluates strategic acquisition opportunities and other various strategic alternatives that could involve the sale or acquisition of branches or other assets  or the consolidation or creation of subsidiaries 
during  as part of its ongoing effort to reduce complexity and improve efficiency  the corporation merged first federal capital bank  associated bank minnesota  national association  associated bank chicago  and state financial bank  national association  into associated bank  national association  its national banking charter headquartered in green bay  wisconsin 
overview the corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in wisconsin  providing a diversified range of banking and nonbanking services to individuals and businesses primarily in its three state footprint wisconsin  illinois and minnesota 
the corporation s recent acquisition activity impacts financial results between the annual periods  as includes full year operating results of the first federal capital corp first federal and jabas group  inc jabas acquisitions and three months of the state financial services corporation state financial acquisition  while includes two months of first federal  nine months of jabas and no state financial activity 
see also section business combinations and note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s primary sources of revenue are net interest income predominantly from loans and deposits  and also from investment securities and other funding sources  and noninterest income  particularly fees and other revenue from financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits 
business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential  and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors  including market interest rates  business spending  consumer confidence  economic growth  and competitive conditions within the marketplace as well 
in and also looking toward  the corporation has been evaluating its balance sheet  positioning itself to improve its quality of earnings ie  increasing earnings potential from core banking and the wealth business  continuing to maintain its attention on asset quality  and controlling expenses even with integration and conversion of the first federal and state financial acquisitions 
net interest income in which included three months contribution from state financial and a full year from first federal increased over which included two months contribution from first federal  primarily due to a increase in average earning assets or increase without the acquisitions 
the net interest margin declined to from in the corporation has been asset sensitive during and  positioned to benefit from rising rates 
however  while short term rates rose since mid year and throughout as expected  longer term rates did not move commensurately  flattening the yield curve 
table of contents over the two year period 
this rate environment and competitive pricing pressures substantially offset the benefits to the margin from the interest rate increases that occurred 
in october  the corporation began an initiative to reduce wholesale borrowings by to billion  through year end  to improve net interest margin and the quality of earnings 
this initiative includes buying back the corporation s common stock when opportunistic 
by executing this effort over time  the pace of the program can be accelerated or slowed as warranted by changing market conditions 
the corporation made progress on this initiative in the fourth quarter of excluding the state financial acquisition  the corporation reduced investments by approximately million  and deposits grew more than loans by approximately million  during fourth quarter these cash flows were used to reduce wholesale funding by million  excluding state financial  and to repurchase approximately million shares of the corporation s common stock 
for  the corporation continues to be positioned to benefit from rising rates  assuming anticipated rate increases by the federal reserve  a steepening of the yield curve  and no other significant changes in the balance sheet 
also  related to our wholesale borrowings reduction initiative  as investments decline and loans grow  there should be net interest income and margin expansion  since loans typically earn a higher spread than investments 
however  these potential benefits are at risk to other factors  such as competitive pricing pressures that are expected to continue in  future changes in our balance sheet mix from management action and or from customer behavior relative to loan or deposit products  and challenges to deposit growth as noted below 
total deposits grew billion or between year end and however  excluding state financial  total deposits were down billion or 
deposit growth will be a key factor behind improving the quality of earnings and reducing wholesale funding in yet competition for deposits has been high for many years 
challenges to deposit growth include a cyclical decline in deposits during first quarter  competitive pricing pressures  pricing deposits up in the anticipated rising rate environment  customer behavior shifting deposits to higher costing deposit products  and potential disintermediation to improving stock markets 
additionally  deposit retention related to acquisitions is most at risk typically in the first year following acquisition 
we anticipate our alignment of deposit products across our expanded distribution coupled with our training and incentive programs should aid our deposit growth initiatives in total loans grew billion or between year end and excluding state financial  total loans were up billion or  led by billion growth in commercial and industrial loans  but offset by a billion decline in total commercial real estate including real estate construction  in part due to the impact on competitive pricing from the flat yield curve and the corporation purposefully adhering to its risk reward discipline 
increases in business spending and consumer confidence in  strategic growth objectives  and an anticipated steepening of the yield curve are expected to create an environment for increased earnings from loans 
asset quality during was aided by general economic improvements and the resolution of many problem credits  and benefited from a continued strong credit management focus 
the provision for loan losses for was million  similar to net charge offs of million 
net charge offs to average loans remained low at for compared to for nonperforming loans fell to million at year end  versus million at year end  even while total loans increased billion between the comparable periods 
at december   the allowance for loan losses to loans ratio of was deemed adequate by management  covering of nonperforming loans  compared to at december   covering of nonperforming loans 
certain economic indicators suggest that business spending has begun to increase and that business and consumer financial positions are improving in line with recent economic improvements 
however  it is unknown how rising interest rates  which occurred in and which are expected to continue in  will ultimately impact profitability of businesses or the ability to service potentially rising debt costs of businesses and consumers for management expects that the provision for loan losses will be higher than in  but anticipates it will be commensurate with loan growth  credit quality indicators  net charge off levels  and unique circumstances of individual credits 

table of contents noninterest income increased by million or in compared to  aided in part by the timing of the acquisitions 
noninterest income sources continue to be diversified  cross selling of services remains a focus  and pricing is routinely evaluated 
this momentum  along with a full year contribution from state financial  is expected to improve total noninterest revenues in to better manage earnings volatility risks in its growing mortgage portfolio serviced for others in light of anticipated lower secondary mortgage production potential  the corporation sold billion or of its mortgage portfolio serviced for others during fourth quarter noninterest expense rose million or over  reflecting the larger operating base attributable to the and acquisitions 
personnel expenses accounted for almost half of the increase up million or  as the corporation paid on average more full time equivalent employees during than during  paid merit increases and incurred higher health benefit costs between the years 
however  the number of full time equivalent employees was minimally changed between year ends  at year end versus  at year end  primarily attributable to eliminated positions from the acquisitions throughout the year 
the efficiency ratio defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net asset and securities gains was for and for noninterest expense will increase in as there will be a full year of state financial included  the corporation does not anticipate any further cost savings of significance in from the state financial conversion completed during fourth quarter  and as employment costs rise including higher incentives  health benefits  and stock option expense 
the corporation remains committed to monitoring costs and maintaining an efficiency ratio at or below 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expense for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights valuation  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and income taxes 
the consolidated financial statements of the corporation are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
this preparation requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions  and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
management believes the following policies are both important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments and  therefore  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies 
the critical accounting policies are discussed directly with the audit committee of the corporation 
allowance for loan losses management s evaluation process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the evaluation process combines several factors management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss and delinquency experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change significantly 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the corporation believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as recorded in the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section allowance for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights valuation the fair value of the corporation s mortgage servicing rights asset is important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements since the mortgage servicing rights are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices 
as such  like other participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation relies on an internal discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
the use of an internal discounted cash flow model involves judgment  particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of underlying mortgages serviced and the overall level of interest rates 
loan type and note rate are the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans used to stratify capitalized mortgage servicing rights for purposes of measuring impairment 
the corporation periodically reviews the assumptions underlying the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
in addition  the corporation consults periodically with third parties as to the assumptions used and to determine that the resultant valuation is within the context of the market 
while the corporation believes that the values produced by its internal model are indicative of the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights portfolio  these values can change significantly depending upon key factors  such as the then current interest rate environment  estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced  and other economic conditions 
to better understand the sensitivity of the impact on prepayment speeds to changes in interest rates  if mortgage interest rates moved up basis points bp at december  holding all other factors unchanged  it is anticipated that prepayment speeds would have slowed and the modeled estimated value of mortgage servicing rights could have been million higher than that determined at december  leading to more valuation allowance reversal and an increase in mortgage banking income 
conversely  if mortgage interest rates moved down bp  prepayment speeds would have likely increased and the modeled estimated value of mortgage servicing rights could have been million lower leading to adding more valuation allowance and a decrease in mortgage banking income 
the proceeds that might be received should the corporation actually consider a sale of some or all of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point in time 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation sold a portion of the portfolio serviced for others 
the corporation believes the mortgage servicing rights asset is properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and intangible assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section noninterest income 
derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
derivative instruments are required to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded directly in earnings 
to qualify for and maintain hedge accounting  the corporation must meet formal documentation and effectiveness evaluation requirements both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires strict adherence to documentation and effectiveness testing requirements  judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
if in the future derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
when hedge accounting is discontinued  the corporation would continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value  however  for a cash flow derivative changes in its fair value would be recorded in earnings instead of through other comprehensive income  and for a fair value derivative the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability would no longer be recorded through earnings 
effective in second quarter  the corporation determined that the hedge accounting applied to certain interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap needed to be changed under the requirements of sfas consequently  the corporation recorded a million loss in other income effective for the quarter ended june   which after tax was a million reduction to net income  or to both basic and diluted earnings per share in that quarter 
certain derivative instruments that lost hedge accounting treatment were terminated in the third quarter of at a net gain of million recorded in other income 
see note  summary of significant accounting 
table of contents policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section interest rate risk 
income tax accounting the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
the corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting practices  and note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section income taxes 
business combinations the corporation s business combination activity is detailed in note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
all the corporation s business combinations since were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  thus  the results of operations of the acquired institutions prior to their respective consummation dates were not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in each acquisition  the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired were allocated to the identifiable intangible assets  if any  with the remainder then allocated to goodwill 
in there was one completed business combination state financial on october   the corporation consummated its acquisition of of the outstanding shares of state financial 
based on the terms of the agreement  the consummation of the transaction included the issuance of approximately million shares of the corporation s common stock and million in cash 
as of the acquisition date  state financial was a billion financial services company based in milwaukee  wisconsin  with banking branches in southeastern wisconsin and northeastern illinois  providing commercial and retail banking products 
the corporation expects to expand its branch distribution network  improve its operational efficiencies  and increase revenue streams with the state financial acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation integrated and converted state financial onto its centralized operating systems and merged state financial into its banking subsidiary  associated bank  national association 
in there were two completed business combinations first federal on october   the corporation consummated its acquisition of of the outstanding shares of first federal  based in la crosse  wisconsin 
based on the terms of the agreement  the consummation of the transaction included the issuance of approximately million shares of the corporation s common stock and million in cash 
as of the acquisition date  first federal operated a billion savings bank with over banking locations serving more than communities in wisconsin  northern illinois  and southern minnesota  building upon and complementing the corporation s footprint 
as a result of the acquisition  the corporation expected to enhance its current branch distribution including supermarket locations which were new to the corporation s distribution model  improve its operational and managerial efficiencies  increase revenue streams  and strengthen its community banking model 
in february  the corporation completed its conversion of first federal onto its centralized operating systems and merged the thrift charter into its banking subsidiary  associated bank  national association 
jabas on april   the corporation through its subsidiary  associated financial group  llc consummated its cash acquisition of of the outstanding shares of jabas 
jabas is an insurance agency specializing in employee benefit products headquartered in kimberly  wisconsin 
jabas operates as part of associated financial group  llc 
in there was one completed business combination 
cfg on april   the corporation consummated its cash acquisition of of the outstanding shares of cfg  a closely held insurance agency headquartered in minnetonka  minnesota 
effective in june  cfg operated as associated financial group  llc 
cfg  an independent  full line insurance agency  was acquired to enhance the growth of the corporation s existing insurance business 

table of contents segment review as described in part i  section services  and in note  segment reporting  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation s primary reportable segment is banking 
banking consists of lending and deposit gathering as well as other banking related products and services to businesses  governments  and consumers and the support to deliver  fund  and manage such banking services 
the corporation s wealth management segment provides products and a variety of fiduciary  investment management  advisory  and corporate agency services to assist customers in building  investing  or protecting their wealth  including insurance  brokerage  and trust asset management 
note  segment reporting  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  indicates that the banking segment represents of total revenues in  as defined in the note 
the corporation s profitability is predominantly dependent on net interest income  noninterest income  the level of the provision for loan losses  noninterest expense  and taxes of its banking segment 
the consolidated discussion is therefore predominantly describing the banking segment results 
the critical accounting policies primarily affect the banking segment  with the exception of income tax accounting  which affects both the banking and wealth management segments see section critical accounting policies 
performance summary the corporation s recent acquisition activity impacts financial results between the annual periods  as includes full year operating results of the first federal and jabas acquisitions and three months of state financial  while includes two months of first federal  nine months of jabas  and no state financial activity

taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  million or higher than taxable equivalent interest income increased million  while interest expense increased by million 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was attributable to favorable volume variances adding million to taxable equivalent net interest income  offset in part by unfavorable rate variances reducing taxable equivalent net interest income by million 
on average  earning assets increased billion or to billion  while interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion 
net interest income and net interest margin were impacted by a prolonged flattening yield curve ie  rising short term interest rates without commensurate increases to longer term interest rates beginning mid year through year end  as well as by competitive pricing pressures on loans and deposits

all remaining noninterest expense categories on a combined basis increased million or over income tax expense of million was up million from  due to both an increase in income before tax and a higher effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate in was compared to in  as the acquisitions each added to income before tax and had higher effective tax rates than the corporation prior to the acquisitions 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income in the consolidated statements of income which excludes the taxable equivalent adjustment was million in compared to million in the taxable equivalent adjustments the adjustments to bring tax exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after tax income had that income been subject to a taxation using a tax rate of million and million for and  respectively  resulted in fully taxable equivalent net interest income of million in and million in net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest earning and other assets or activities 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates  which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  repricing frequencies  and the use of interest rate swaps and caps 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally noninterest bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity  
table of contents also support earning assets 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis

taxable equivalent net interest income of million for was million or higher than the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was attributable principally to a higher level of earning assets  offset to a lesser degree by unfavorable interest rate changes 
as shown in the rate volume analysis in table  volume changes  including the impact of the acquisitions  added million to taxable equivalent net interest income in the growth and change in mix of earning assets added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  while the growth and composition of interest bearing liabilities cost an additional million  for a net favorable volume impact of million 
rate changes on earning assets increased interest income by million  while changes in rates on interest bearing liabilities raised interest expense by million  for a net unfavorable rate impact of million 
the significant and prolonged flattening of the yield curve and competitive pricing pressures substantially offset the benefits to the margin from the interest rate increases that occurred in the second half of and throughout see additional discussion in section interest rate risk 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in the bp compression in net interest margin was attributable to a bp decrease in interest rate spread with a bp higher yield on earning assets more than offset by a bp increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  partially reduced by bp higher contribution from net free funds as higher interest rates increased the value of noninterest bearing demand deposits 
interest rates were generally stable and historically low during the first half of since mid year  the federal government raised interest rates times  each time by bp 
at december  the federal funds rate was  bp higher than at december  on average  the federal funds rate was for  bp higher than  and the prime rate was for  bp higher than the previous year 
for  the yield on earning assets of was bp higher than loan yields increased bp to 
although short term interest rates were rising throughout the second half of and all of  the favorable impact on loan yields was moderated by competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans in the flatter yield curve environment  the portion of the loan portfolio that is fixed rate  and the lag in repricing of variable rate loans 
the yield on securities and other short term investments decreased bp to  as maturities and principal paydowns in were reinvested in securities with lower yields 
overall  earning asset rate changes added million to interest income  the net of million higher interest on loans and million lower interest on securities and short term investments combined 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities of in was bp higher than  reflecting the higher interest rate environment 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits was in  bp higher than as interest rates rose  most interest bearing deposit products repriced and customers switched balances from lower priced transaction accounts to longer term  higher paying deposit products 
the cost of wholesale funds comprised of short term borrowings and long term funding increased bp to for the cost of short term borrowings  most directly impacted by increases in the federal funds rate  was up bp  while long term funding costs increased more moderately  by bp  due largely to procuring longer term funding at advantageous times given the flat yield curve 
the interest bearing liability rate changes resulted in million higher interest expense  with million attributable to interest bearing deposits and million due to wholesale funding 
average earning assets were billion in  billion or higher than the increase in average earning assets was attributable to the acquisitions of both first federal and state financial  as well as to organic growth

see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporation s income tax accounting policy and section critical accounting policies 
income tax expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income involves interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes  and is  therefore  considered a critical accounting policy 
the corporation undergoes examination by various taxing authorities 
such taxing authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense or valuation allowance be recognized when their interpretations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

commercial loans are generally viewed as having more inherent risk of default than residential mortgage or retail loans 
also  the commercial loan balance per borrower is typically larger than that for residential mortgage and retail loans  inferring higher potential losses on an individual customer basis 
the corporation does not have nontraditional loan products that in its judgment increase the concentration of credit risk 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans were billion at the end of  up million or since year end  and comprised of total loans outstanding  up from at the end of the commercial  financial  and agricultural loan classification primarily consists of commercial loans to middle market companies and small businesses 
loans of this type are in a diverse range of industries 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations or on the value of underlying collateral  if any 
borrower demand in this loan sector improved during  and price competition has been strong 
within the commercial  financial  and agricultural classification  loans to finance agricultural production totaled less than of total loans for all periods presented 
real estate construction loans grew million or to billion  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to billion or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multifamily or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances 
commercial real estate includes commercial based loans that are secured by multifamily properties and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties and  to a lesser degree  by farmland 
commercial real estate 
table of contents totaled billion at december   up million or over december   and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed above for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multifamily properties  and community purpose properties 
loans are primarily made to customers based in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in local markets and businesses  periodically evaluating the underlying collateral  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
in many cases the corporation will take additional real estate collateral to further secure the overall lending relationship 
retail loans totaled billion at december   up million or compared to  and represented of the year end loan portfolio versus at year end loans in this classification include home equity and installment loans 
home equity consists of home equity lines and residential mortgage junior liens  while installment loans consist of educational loans  as well as short term and other personal installment loans  such as direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers  as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions 
residential mortgage loans totaled billion at the end of  up million or from the prior year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end residential mortgage loans include conventional first lien home mortgages  and the corporation generally limits the maximum loan to of collateral value 
as part of its management of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans  nearly all of the corporation s long term  fixed rate residential real estate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained 
factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas within our primary three state area 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions

allowance for loan losses credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each different loan type 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  a thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  aids in the management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  an allocation methodology is applied by the corporation which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired or other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  historical losses and delinquencies on each portfolio category  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
assessing these factors involves significant judgment 
therefore  management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies and further discussion in this section 
see also management s allowance for loan losses accounting policy in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional allowance for loan losses disclosures

determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a function of evaluating a number of factors  including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio see table  net charge offs see table  nonperforming loans see table  and evaluating specific credits 
as previously discussed  and net charge offs as a percent of average loans declined after two years of higher than historical levels  particularly in commercial net charge offs  aided by lower gross charge offs in and by higher recoveries in as discussed under section loans  total loans were billion at december   up billion over december  attributable largely to the billion state financial loans acquired  but also from organic growth primarily in commercial and home equity loans

see table and section nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned for additional details and discussion 
the corporation s process designed to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes an allocation methodology  as well as management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio into criticized loan categories defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation  or a criticized status of watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
the allocation methodology focuses on evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  underlying collateral  historical losses and delinquencies on each portfolio category  and other qualitative and quantitative factors 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of the corporation s allowance for loan losses for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology was similar for all years  with a refinement beginning in  whereby the corporation segregated its loss factors allocations used for both criticized and non criticized loans into a component primarily based on historical loss rates and a component primarily based on other qualitative factors that may affect loan collectibility 
management does not believe the refined method produced a significantly different result from the method used in and prior years 
the following describes the corporation s process for and management allocates the allowance for loan losses for credit losses by pools of risk 
first  a valuation allowance estimate is established for specifically identified commercial and commercial real estate loans determined to be impaired by the corporation  using discounted cash flows  estimated fair value of underlying collateral  and or other data available 
second  management allocates allowance for loan losses with loss factors  for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for non criticized loan pools by loan type  primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type  historical loss and delinquency experience  and industry statistics 
loans that have been criticized are considered to have greater inherent risk of loss than non criticized loans  as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade  warranting higher loss factors 
the loss factors applied in the methodology are expected to be relatively static year over year but are periodically re evaluated 
there were no changes in loss factors assigned to criticized and non criticized loan pools by type between and  however  between and the loss factors were similar but with reductions made in factors for commercial real estate and residential real estate types to align closer to historical loss levels 
and third  management allocates allowance for loan losses to absorb unrecognized losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to other factors evaluated by management  such as limitations within the credit risk grading process  known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends  industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors  and other relevant considerations 
at december  and  this third allocation  which was previously noted in table as unallocated  was completely assigned to loan types  as reflected in table at year end  of the allowance for loan losses compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance provided for a previously disclosed commercial manufacturing credit million outstanding at december  for which management has continuing doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan 
during  the corporation received a million paydown on this commercial manufacturing credit and  therefore  the provided allowance was reduced from million to 
table of contents million after evaluation of the remaining credit 
the allocation of the allowance by loan type between and was minimally changed with a slight increase to real estate construction from residential real estate 
the amount allocated to real estate construction at december   was million up million  representing versus at december  
the increased allocation to real estate construction loans was made given the rise in real estate construction loans in nonperforming loans versus at year end  the increase in their percentage of total loan mix at year end versus at year end  and higher net charge offs million for compared to none for 
the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans at year end was million up million  representing of the allowance for loan losses at year end and the additional amount allocated to commercial real estate loans was primarily based on a higher amount of these loans in criticized categories versus at year end and other indicators of a potentially softening commercial real estate market 
the largest portion of the allowance at year end was allocated to commercial  financial and agricultural loans  and was million up million  representing of the allowance for loan losses at year end and the commercial  financial and agricultural allowance allocation is supported by an increase in these loans as a percentage of total loan mix at year end versus at year end and higher gross charge offs million for versus million for  though minimal change in the amount of these loans in criticized categories versus at year end  and a decline in nonperforming commercial  financial and agricultural loans compared to for year end 
the allowance allocations to residential real estate versus for year end and installment loans for both years were relatively unchanged between and  though were increased between and as there were and continue to be concerns about the impact of rising rates on consumer debt  the growth in the use of home equity  and uncertain other economic conditions 
the allocation methods used for december  and were comparable 
at year end  of the allowance for loan losses compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance identified for a previously disclosed commercial manufacturing credit million outstanding at december  for which management had doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan 
the primary shift in the allowance allocation between and was from commercial real estate to commercial  financial  and agricultural 
the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans at year end was million  representing down from at year end of the allowance for loan losses  partly due to applying lower loss factors to this loan type in versus as mentioned earlier 
supporting this lower allocation was a a lesser amount of these loans in criticized categories versus at year end  b lower gross charge offs million compared to million for  and c fewer commercial real estate loans in nonperforming loans compared to at year end 
on the other hand  the allowance allocated to commercial  financial and agricultural loans was million at year end  representing versus at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
while certain indicators were relatively steady for commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  such as minimal change in their percentage of total loans at year end versus or of their percentage of nonperforming loans compared to at year end  and lower gross charge offs  the higher allocation was made given additional loans which are currently not criticized but exhibit concerns to management due to industry issues or the slower than expected improvement in the individual credit relationships 
allowance allocations were higher to residential real estate particularly influenced by the growth of home equity and to installment loans as current economic conditions of rising rates and growing consumer debt carried uncertainties requiring management s judgment as to the impact on individual borrowers 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  consolidated net income could be affected if management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses is subsequently materially different  requiring additional or less provision for loan losses to be recorded 
management carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors  its assumptions  and the likelihood of materially different conditions that could alter its assumptions 
while management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
additionally  the number of large credit relationships over the corporation s million internal hurdle has 
table of contents been increasing in recent years 
larger credits do not inherently create more credit risk  but can create wider fluctuations in asset quality measures 
as an integral part of their examination process  various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are considered one indicator of potential future loan losses 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
the corporation had approximately million  million  and million at december    and  respectively  of nonperforming student loans 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and are in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

the corporation s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at year end  up from at year end and at year end the improving trend in nonperforming loans was primarily due to decreases in commercial nonperforming loans primarily attributable to the payment or resolution of specific larger commercial credits 
the most significant reductions in commercial nonaccrual loans during were attributable to the payments on two large problem credits including a million payment on a commercial credit within the food industry and a million payment on a commercial manufacturing credit  net of the commercial nonaccrual loans acquired from state financial  which totaled approximately million at year end

table of contents for year end versus  the million improvement in commercial nonaccrual loans was predominantly attributable to the payment or other resolutions on specific larger commercial credits including resolutions of the two credits totaling million at year end  which at december  one credit was paid in full and the other credit had a remaining outstanding balance of million  despite approximately million in nonperforming loans acquired with first federal at year end and the addition of a million commercial credit in the food industry in late the million decrease from year end to year end in accruing loans past due days or more was primarily attributable to one large commercial credit million at december   which was subsequently transferred to nonaccrual status

management actively seeks to ensure properties held are monitored to minimize the corporation s risk of loss 
the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the approximate gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period 
table foregone loan interest years ended december  in thousands interest income in accordance with original terms interest income recognized reduction in interest income potential problem loans are certain loans bearing criticized loan risk ratings by management but that are not in nonperforming status  however  there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms 
the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognized a higher degree of risk associated with these loans 
the level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry but rather cover a diverse range of businesses 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million  compared to million at december  the million increase from year end to year end is primarily attributable to deterioration of certain commercial loans in various industries accountable for approximately million of the increase and the state financial acquisition accountable for approximately million of the increase

the corporation competes with other bank and nonbank institutions  as well as with investment alternatives such as money market or other mutual funds and brokerage houses  for deposits 
challenges to deposit growth include a cyclical decline in deposits during first quarter  competitive pricing pressures  pricing deposits up in the anticipated rising rate environment  customer behavior shifting deposits to higher costing deposit products  and potential disintermediation to improving stock markets 
additionally  deposit retention related to acquisitions is most at risk typically in the first year following acquisition

long term funding at december   was billion  up million from december   due primarily to the issuance of million of bank notes  and net increases of million in long term repurchase agreements and million in long term fhlb advances including balances acquired with the state financial acquisition 
see note  long term funding  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term funding

short term borrowings at december  were billion  million lower than december   primarily in bank notes and fhlb advances 
the fhlb advances included in short term borrowings are those with original maturities of less than one year 
the treasury  tax  and loan notes are demand notes representing secured borrowings from the us treasury  collateralized by qualifying securities and loans 
this funding program provides funds at the discretion of the us treasury that may be called at any time 
many short term borrowings  particularly federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  are expected to be reissued and  therefore  do not represent an immediate need for cash

liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that the corporation has the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost effective manner to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to meet its other commitments as they fall due  including the ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries or acquisitions  repurchase common stock  and satisfy other operating requirements 
funds are available from a number of basic banking activity sources  primarily from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio  lines of credit with major banks  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
the corporation s capital can be a source of funding and liquidity as well 
see section capital 
the corporation s internal liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid assets to short term wholesale funding 
strong capital ratios  credit quality  and core earnings are essential to retaining high credit ratings and  consequently  cost effective access to the wholesale funding markets 
a downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an 
table of contents impact on the corporation s ability to access wholesale funding at favorable interest rates 
as a result  capital ratios  asset quality measurements  and profitability ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process 
at december   the corporation was in compliance with its liquidity objectives 
while core deposits and loan and investment repayment are principal sources of liquidity  funding diversification is another key element of liquidity management 
diversity is achieved by strategically varying depositor type  term  funding market  and instrument 
as noted below  the parent company and its subsidiary bank are rated by moody s  standard and poor s s p  and fitch 
these ratings  along with the corporation s other ratings  provide opportunity for greater funding capacity and funding alternatives 
table credit ratings at december  fitch moody s s p ratings bank short term p a f bank long term a a a corporation short term p a f corporation long term a bbb a subordinated debt long term baa bbb bbb the parent company s primary funding sources are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the bank 
as discussed in item  the subsidiary bank is subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the shareholder or for other cash needs 
the parent company also has multiple funding sources that could be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility 
these sources include two shelf registrations to issue debt and preferred securities or a combination thereof and  used to a lesser degree  a revolving credit facility and commercial paper issuances 
the parent company has available a million revolving credit facility with established lines of credit from nonaffiliated banks  of which the entire amount was available at december  in addition  under the parent company s million commercial paper program  million of commercial paper was outstanding and million of commercial paper was available at december  in may  the parent company filed a shelf registration statement under which the parent company may offer up to million of trust preferred securities 
in may  million of trust preferred securities were issued  bearing a fixed coupon rate 
at december   million was available under the trust preferred shelf 
in may  the parent company filed a shelf registration statement whereby the parent company may offer up to million of any combination of the following securities  either separately or in units debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  common stock  and warrants 
in august  the parent company issued million in a subordinated note offering  bearing a fixed coupon rate and year maturity 
at december   million was available under the shelf registration 
investment securities are an important tool to the corporation s liquidity objective 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the billion investment portfolio at december   billion were pledged to secure certain deposits or for other purposes as required or permitted by law  and million of federal reserve and fhlb stock combined is restricted in nature and less liquid than other tradable equity securities see section investment securities portfolio and note  investment securities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of remaining securities could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity  if necessary 

table of contents the bank subsidiary has a variety of funding sources in addition to key liquidity sources  such as core deposits  loan and investment portfolio repayments and maturities  and loan and investment portfolio sales available to increase financial flexibility 
a bank note program associated with associated bank  national association  was established during under this program  short term and long term debt may be issued 
as of december   million of long term bank notes were outstanding and million was available under the bank note program 
the corporation instituted a new bank note program during the third quarter of  of which billion was available at december  the new bank note program will be utilized upon completion of the bank note program 
the bank has also established federal funds lines with major banks and the ability to borrow from the federal home loan bank billion was outstanding at december  
in addition  the bank subsidiary also issues institutional certificates of deposit  from time to time offers brokered certificates of deposit  and to a lesser degree  accepts eurodollar deposits 
as reflected in table  the corporation has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and other commitments  which may require future cash payments 
shorter maturities of time deposits seen in table could imply near term liquidity risk if such deposit balances do not rollover at maturity into new time or non time deposits at the corporation 
however  the relatively shorter maturities in time deposits are not out of the ordinary to the corporation s experience of its customer base preference and there has been growth in deposits 
continued strategic emphasis on deposit growth should further support this liquidity source 
many short term borrowings  particularly federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  are expected to be reissued and  therefore  do not represent an immediate need for cash 
the corporation has been purposely extending its long term funding sources primarily to take advantage of extending maturities in the lower rate environment 
while this commits the corporation contractually to future cash payments  it is supportive of interest rate risk and liquidity management strategies 
as a financial services provider  the corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the corporation  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
for the year ended december   net cash provided from operating and investing activities was million and million  respectively  while financing activities used net cash of million  for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million since year end generally  net asset growth since year end was modest up  primarily attributable to the state financial acquisition 
deposits and long term funding were primarily utilized to support the net asset growth  finance the state financial acquisition  provide for the repayment of short term borrowings and long term funding  common stock repurchases  and the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s shareholders 
for the year ended december   net cash provided from operating and financing activities was million and million  respectively  while investing activities used net cash of billion  for a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million since year end in general  net asset growth since year end was strong  primarily due to the first federal acquisition  as well as organic growth 
therefore  various funding sources were utilized to support the net asset growth  particularly deposits  short term borrowings  and long term funding 
these funding sources partially financed the first federal and jabas acquisitions  provided for the repayment of short term borrowings and long term funding  common stock repurchases  and the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s shareholders 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporation s asset liability committee and approved by the board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on 
table of contents the corporation s exposure to a bp and bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses three different measurement tools static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and economic value of equity 
these three measurement tools represent static ie  point in time measures that do not take into account subsequent interest rate changes  changes in management strategies and market conditions  and future production of assets or liabilities  among other factors 
static gap analysis the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan products and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within days days days year over year total in thousands earning assets loans held for sale investment securities  at fair value loans other earning assets total earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits other interest bearing liabilities interest rate swap total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap month cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets at december  included in loans are million of fixed rate commercial loans that have been swapped from fixed rate to floating rate and have been reflected with their repricing altered for the impact of the swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing demand deposit accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances are considered to be long term and fairly stable and are  therefore  included in the over year category 
for analysis purposes  brokered cds of million have been included with other interest bearing liabilities and excluded from interest bearing deposits 

table of contents the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator that does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
as of december   the month cumulative gap results were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
at the end of  the corporation s balance sheet was asset sensitive to interest rate movements 
asset sensitive means that assets will reprice faster than liabilities 
in a rising rate environment  an asset sensitive bank will generally benefit 
during  the corporation remained asset sensitive as a result of issuing long term funding  growth in demand deposits  and shortening of the mortgage portfolio and investment portfolio due to faster prepayment experience 
however  the flattening of the yield curve and competitive pricing pressures substantially offset the benefits to net interest income from the interest rate increases that occurred during the second half of and throughout for  the corporation believes it is positioned to benefit from rising rates  assuming anticipated increases by the federal reserve and a steepening of the yield curve  though such potential benefit is at risk to other factors  such as competitive pricing pressures that are expected to continue in  future changes in our balance sheet mix from management action and or from customer behavior relative to loan or deposit products  and challenges to deposit growth in general 
see also section net interest income 
interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation and economic value of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk 
simulation of earnings along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of short term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus bp and bp parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings included the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net interest income for the next month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus bp parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net interest income would increase by approximately of budgeted net interest income if rates rose by a bp shock  and projected that the net interest income would decrease by approximately if rates fell by a bp shock 
at december   the bp shock up was projected to increase budgeted net interest income by approximately  and the bp shock down was projected to decrease budgeted net interest income by approximately 
as of december   the simulation of earnings results was within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
economic value of equity economic value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest rates on the value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
this measurement is a longer term analysis of interest rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors 
these factors may include changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances is included within the simulation process 
this action could include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  extending liabilities  using financial derivative products to hedge interest rate risk  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  or changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the projected changes for earnings simulation and economic value of equity for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 

table of contents the corporation uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above 
they are used to modify the corporation s exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
derivative financial instruments are also discussed in note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below summarizes interest rate swaps at december  by maturity date 
not included in the table below were customer swaps and caps with a notional amount of million as of december   for which the corporation has mirror swaps and caps

there were no floors outstanding at december  contractual obligations  commitments  off balance sheet arrangements  and contingent liabilities through the normal course of operations  the corporation has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments  including but not limited to those most usually related to funding of operations through deposits or debt  commitments to extend credit  derivative contracts to assist management of interest rate exposure  and to a lesser degree leases for premises and equipment 
table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments at december   at those amounts contractually due to the recipient  not including any interest  unamortized premiums or discounts  hedge basis adjustments  or other similar carrying value adjustments

the corporation may have a variety of financial transactions that  under generally accepted accounting principles  are either not recorded on the balance sheet or are recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts 
the corporation s derivative contracts  under which the corporation is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates applied to notional amounts  are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rate change 
because neither the derivative assets and liabilities  nor their notional amounts  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  they are not included in the table for further information and discussion of derivative contracts  see section interest rate risk  and table  and note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation does not have significant off balance sheet arrangements such as the use of special purpose entities or securitization trusts 
related to the million commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale in table included in commitments to extend credit  the corporation had outstanding forward commitments to sell million of loans to various investors as of december   both of which are derivatives see note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
residential mortgage loans sold to others are sold on a nonrecourse basis  though first federal retained the credit risk on the underlying loans it sold to the fhlb  prior to its acquisition by the corporation  in exchange for a monthly credit enhancement fee 
after acquisition  the corporation no longer delivered loans to the fhlb under this program 
at december   there were billion of such loans with credit risk recourse  upon which there have been negligible historical losses 
the corporation also has standby letters of credit guarantees for payment to third parties of specified amounts if customers fail to pay  carried on balance sheet at an estimate of their fair value of million  and commercial letters of credit off balance sheet commitments generally authorizing a third party to draw drafts on us up to a stated amount and typically having underlying goods shipments at collateral of million at december  since most of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

any fractional shares resulting from the dividend were paid in cash 

table of contents stockholders equity of december   increased million to billion  or per share compared with per share at the end of book value per share increased at year end  primarily due to recording the shares issued in the state financial transaction at market value  as prescribed by the purchase accounting method 
stockholders equity is also described in note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the board of directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of the corporation s common stock each quarter in the market  to be made available for issuance in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
for the corporation s employee incentive plans  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares  shares per quarter in and of these authorizations  approximately million shares were repurchased for million during at an average cost of per share with approximately million shares reissued in connection with stock options exercised  while approximately million shares were repurchased for million during at an average cost of per share with approximately million shares reissued in connection with stock options exercised 
additionally  under two separate actions in and one action in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase and cancellation of the corporation s outstanding shares  not to exceed approximately million shares on a combined basis 
during  the corporation repurchased and cancelled approximately million shares of its outstanding common stock for million or an average cost of per share from ubs ag london branch ubs under accelerated share repurchase programs 
the accelerated share repurchase enabled the corporation to repurchase the shares immediately  while ubs will purchase the shares in the market over time 
the repurchased shares will be subject to future purchase price settlement adjustment 
in february  the corporation settled one of the accelerated share repurchase agreements at an average cost of per share 
no shares were repurchased under these authorizations during at december   approximately million shares remain authorized to repurchase 
the repurchase of shares will be based on market opportunities  capital levels  growth prospects  and other investment opportunities 
shares repurchased and not retired are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements 
it is management s intent to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return 
fourth quarter results net income for fourth quarter was million  million or higher than the million earned in the fourth quarter of  attributable in part to the full quarter inclusion of the state financial and first federal acquisitions in fourth quarter results 
basic and diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter were and  respectively  compared to for both measures for the fourth quarter see table for selected quarterly information 
net interest income for fourth quarter of million was million higher than fourth quarter and taxable equivalent net interest income of million was million higher between the fourth quarter periods 
favorable volume variances from both the acquisitions and organic growth added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  while rate variances were unfavorable by million as increased rates on earning assets added million to taxable equivalent interest income  but higher costs of interest bearing liabilities increased interest expense by million 
average earning assets were billion for fourth quarter  an increase of billion over fourth quarter due principally to the acquisitions 
average loans were up billion between the fourth quarter periods  while average securities and short term investments were up billion 
as a percentage of average earning assets  loans increased to for fourth quarter compared to for fourth quarter average investment securities experienced a corresponding decrease to of earning assets for fourth quarter  reflecting the corporate initiative whereby cash from maturing investment securities was not 
table of contents reinvested  but used to reduce wholesale borrowings and repurchase stock 
average interest bearing deposits were higher by billion and average net free funds were up billion  including a million increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits 
the remainder of the growth in average earning assets was funded by a billion increase in wholesale funding 
for liquidity management purposes  the corporation strategically shifted wholesale funding balances from short term borrowings to long term funding 
on average  long term funding represented of interest bearing liabilities for fourth quarter compared to for the same quarter in the federal reserve raised rates by bp ten times across the comparable timeframes  resulting in an average federal funds rate for fourth quarter of  bp higher than the average of for fourth quarter the continued flattening of the yield curve ie  rising short term interest rates without commensurate increases to longer term interest rates  together with competitive pricing on both loans and deposits  put downward pressure on the margin 
the net interest margin was in the fourth quarter of  down bp compared to fourth quarter  the net result of a bp lower interest rate spread and bp higher contribution from net free funds 
the bp decrease in interest rate spread was a function of a bp increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an bp increase in the yield on earning assets 
the bp improvement in contribution of net free funds was largely a function of higher interest rates on interest bearing liabilities which increased the value of noninterest bearing deposits and other net free funds 
the yield on earning assets for fourth quarter was or bp higher than fourth quarter  attributable principally to higher loan yields up bp  as yields on investment securities rose nominally up bp
