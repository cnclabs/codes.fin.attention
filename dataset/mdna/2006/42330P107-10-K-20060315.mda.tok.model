item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview the offshore oilfield services industry originated in the early s as producers began to explore and develop the new frontier of offshore fields 
the industry has grown significantly since the s with service providers taking on greater roles on behalf of the producers 
industry standards were established during this period largely in response to the emergence of the north sea as a major province leading the way into a new hostile frontier 
the methodology of these standards was driven by the requirement of mitigating the risk of developing relatively large reservoirs in a then challenging environment 
this is still true today and these standards are still largely adhered to for all developments even if they are small and the frontier is more understood 
there are factors we believe will influence the industry in the coming years increasing world demand for oil and natural gas  global production rates peaked or peaking  globalization of the natural gas market  increasing number of mature and small reservoirs  increasing ratio of contribution to global production from marginal fields  increasing offshore activity  and increasing subsea developments 
oil and gas prices  the offshore mobile rig count  and deepwater construction activity are three of the primary indicators we use to forecast the future performance of our deepwater and shelf contracting business 
in addition  more recently  damage sustained to the gulf of mexico infrastructure from hurricanes eg katrina and rita has resulted in significant inspection  repair and maintenance activities for our shelf contracting business 
our construction services generally follow successful drilling activities by six to eighteen months on the ocs and twelve months or longer in the deepwater arena 
the level of drilling activity is related to both short and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
oil and natural gas prices have been at robust levels for the last three years and offshore drilling activity has increased  but only modestly in the gulf of mexico 
our primary leading indicator  the number of offshore mobile rigs contracted  is currently at approximately rigs employed in the gulf of mexico  which is comparable with year ago levels 
the deepwater gulf is principally being developed for oil  with the complexity of developing these reservoirs resulting in significant lead times to first production 
in the north sea  the rig count is currently at rigs employed  which compared to during the first quarter of we are an energy services company which provides development solutions and related services to the energy market and specializes in the exploitation of marginal fields  including exploration of unproven fields  where we differentiate ourselves by employing our services on our own oil and gas properties as well as providing services to the open market 
on january   the company and remington oil and gas corporation announced an agreement under which the company will acquire remington in a transaction valued at approximately billion 
under the terms of the agreement  remington stockholders will receive in cash and shares of the company s common stock for each remington share 
the acquisition is conditioned upon  among other things  the approval of remington stockholders and customary regulatory approvals 
the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of remington is an exploration  development and production company with operations in the gulf of mexico 
our business is substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration  drilling and production operations 
the level of capital expenditures generally depends on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices  which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas  including  but not limited to worldwide economic activity  economic and political conditions in the middle east and other oil producing regions  coordination by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  technological advances  
table of contents interest rates and the cost of capital  environmental regulations  and tax policies 
the level of offshore construction activity improved somewhat in and continued the trend in following higher commodity prices in through  and significant damage sustained to the gulf of mexico infrastructure in hurricanes katrina and rita 
we cannot assure you that activity levels will continue to increase 
a sustained period of low drilling and production activity or the return of lower commodity prices would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
product prices impact our oil and gas operations in several respects 
historically  we sought to acquire producing oil and gas properties that were generally in the later stages of their economic life 
the sellers potential abandonment liabilities are a significant consideration with respect to the offshore properties we have purchased to date 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for sale  these higher prices typically contribute to improved operating results for ert 
in contrast  lower natural gas prices typically contribute to lower operating results for ert and a general increase in the number of mature properties available for sale 
during ert acquired a large package of mature properties from murphy exploration production company usa and also acquired equity interests in five deepwater undeveloped properties 
on one such property  ert agreed to participate in the drilling of an exploratory well to be drilled in that targets reserves in deeper sands  within the same trapping fault system  of a currently producing well with estimated drilling costs of approximately million 
if the drilling is successful  ert s share of the development cost is estimated to be an additional million  of which million has been incurred through december  related to long lead equipment 
this equipment can be redeployed if drilling is unsuccessful 
our deepwater contracting assets would participate in this development 
in our production facilities segment we participate in the ownership of production facilities in hub locations where there is potential for significant subsea tieback activity for our marine contracting assets 
we have a interest in the tlp at marco polo  which began production in the second quarter of  and a interest in the independence hub semi submersible which should be online in early regarding deepwater and shelf contracting  vessel utilization is typically lower during the first quarter due to winter weather conditions in the gulf and the north sea 
accordingly  we normally plan our drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
during the first quarter  a substantial number of our customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  we have historically generated up to of our deepwater and shelf contracting revenues in the last six months of the year 
our operations can also be severely impacted by weather during the fourth quarter 
operation of oil and gas properties and production facilities tends to offset the impact of weather since the first and fourth quarters are typically periods of high demand and strong prices for natural gas 
due to this seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
the following table sets forth for the periods presented average us natural gas and oil prices  our equivalent natural gas production  the average number of offshore rigs under contract in the gulf  the number of platforms installed and removed in the gulf and the vessel utilization rates for each of the major categories of our fleet

critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our business segments and or our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
accounting for oil and gas properties ert acquisitions of producing offshore properties are recorded at the fair value exchanged at closing together with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase based upon its working interest ownership percentage 
in estimating the decommissioning liability assumed in offshore property acquisitions  we perform detailed estimating procedures  including engineering studies and then reflect the liability at fair value on a discounted basis as discussed below 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our interests in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
costs incurred relating to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed in the period the drilling is determined to be unsuccessful 
the company evaluates the impairment of its oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  but at least annually  an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
unamortized capital costs are reduced to fair value based upon discounted cash flows if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the asset s net book value 
cash flows are determined based upon proved reserves using prices and costs consistent with those used for internal decision making 
although prices used are likely to approximate market  they do not necessarily represent current market prices 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves the evaluation of our oil and gas reserves is critical to the management of our oil and gas operations 
decisions such as whether development of a property should proceed and what technical methods are available for development are based on an evaluation of reserves 
these oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis for calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation  depletion and amortization  evaluating impairment and estimating the life of our producing oil and gas properties in our decommissioning liabilities 
our proved reserves are classified as either proved developed or proved undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are those 
table of contents reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves include reserves expected to be recovered from new wells from undrilled proven reservoirs or from existing wells where a significant major expenditure is required for completion and production 
we prepare  and independent petroleum engineers huddleston co 
audit  the estimates of our oil and gas reserves presented in this report based on guidelines promulgated under generally accepted accounting principles and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission 
the audit of our reserves by the independent petroleum engineers involves their rigorous examination of our technical evaluation and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines as well as other technical information and measurements 
our internal reservoir engineers interpret this data to determine the nature of the reservoir and ultimately the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
our proved reserves in this annual report include only quantities that we expect to recover commercially using current prices  costs  existing regulatory practices and technology 
while we are reasonably certain that the proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and changes in projections of long term oil and gas prices 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in the previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to evaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production or new geologic or reservoir data obtained from wells 
revisions can also include changes associated with significant changes in development strategy  oil and gas prices  or production equipment facility capacity 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company tests for the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis 
the company s goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models  such as earnings multiples and comparable asset market values 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of november  the company s goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with its carrying amount 
goodwill of million and million related to the company s deepwater contracting segment as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill of million and million related to the company s shelf contracting segment as of december  and  respectively 
none of the company s goodwill was impaired based on the impairment test performed as of november  the annual impairment test excluded the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in the stolt offshore and helix energy limited acquisitions which closed in november 
see footnote for goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisitions 
the company will continue to test its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
property and equipment property and equipment  both owned and under capital leases  are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
for long lived assets to be held and used  excluding goodwill  the company bases its evaluation of recoverability on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the company s marine vessels are assessed on a vessel by vessel basis  while the company s rovs are grouped and assessed by asset class 
if an impairment has occurred  the company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on management s estimate of discounted cash flows 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million included in shelf contracting cost of sales in the accompanying 
table of contents consolidated statement of operations in december on certain shelf contracting vessels that met the impairment criteria 
these assets were subsequently sold in december and january  respectively  for an aggregate gain on the disposals of approximately  assets are classified as held for sale when the company has a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria 
during the fourth quarter of  the company classified a certain shelf contracting vessel and other deepwater contracting property and equipment intended to be disposed of within a twelve month period as assets held for sale totaling million included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  
in july  the company completed the sale of a certain shelf contracting dp rov support vessel  the merlin  for million in cash that was previously included in assets held for sale 
the company recorded an additional impairment of  on the vessel in june in march  the company completed the sale of certain deepwater contracting property and equipment for million that were previously included in assets held for sale 
proceeds from the sale consisted of  cash and a million promissory note bearing interest at per annum due in semi annual installments beginning september  through march  in addition to the asset sale  the company entered into a five year services agreement with the purchaser whereby the company has committed to provide the purchaser with a specified amount of services for its gulf of mexico fleet on an annual basis million per year 
the measurement period related to the services agreement begins with the twelve months ending june  and continues every six months until the contract ends on march  further  the promissory note stipulates that should the company not meet its annual services commitment the purchaser can defer its semi annual principal and interest payment for six months 
the company determined that the estimated gain on the sale of approximately million should be deferred and recognized as the principal and interest payments are received from the purchaser over the course of the promissory note 
the first installment on the million promissory note was received in october and  was recognized as a partial gain on the sale 
recertification costs and deferred drydock charges the company s deepwater and shelf contracting vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock where other routine repairs and maintenance are performed and  at times  major replacements and improvements are performed 
the company expenses routine repairs and maintenance as they are incurred 
recertifcation costs can be accounted for in one of three ways defer and amortize  accrue in advance  or expense as incurred 
the company defers and amortizes recertification costs over the length of time in which the recertification is expected to last  which is generally months 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel s remaining economic useful life 
inherent in this process are estimates the company makes regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
the company accounts for regulatory us coast guard  american bureau of shipping and det norske veritas related drydock inspection and certification expenditures by capitalizing the related costs and amortizing them over the month period between regulatory mandated drydock inspections and certification 
as of december  and  capitalized deferred drydock charges included in other assets  net totaled million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  drydock amortization expense was million  million and million  respectively 
accounting for decommissioning liabilities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  addresses the financial accounting and reporting obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to reflect decommissioning liabilities dismantlement and abandonment of oil and gas wells and offshore platforms on the face of the balance sheet at fair value on a discounted basis 
ert historically has purchased producing offshore oil and gas properties that are in the later stages of production 
in conjunction with acquiring these properties  ert assumes an 
table of contents obligation associated with decommissioning the property in accordance with the regulations set by government agencies 
the abandonment liability related to the acquisitions of these properties is determined through a series of management estimates 
prior to an acquisition and as part of evaluating the economics of an acquisition  ert will estimate the plug and abandonment liability 
ert personnel prepare detailed cost estimates to plug and abandon wells and remove necessary equipment in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
ert currently calculates the discounted value of the abandonment liability based on the estimated year the abandonment will occur in accordance with sfas no 
and capitalizes that portion as part of the basis acquired and records the related abandonment liability at fair value 
decommissioning liabilities were million and million at december  and  respectively 
on an ongoing basis  ert personnel monitor the status of wells on the properties  and as fields deplete and no longer produce  ert will monitor the timing requirements set forth by the mms for plugging and abandoning the wells and commence abandonment operations  when applicable 
on an annual basis  ert and helix management personnel review and update the abandonment estimates and assumptions for changes  among other things  in market conditions  interest rates and historical experience 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment as of january  to record i a million decrease in the carrying values of proved properties  ii a million decrease in accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of property and equipment  iii a million decrease in decommissioning liabilities and iv a million increase in deferred income tax liabilities 
the net impact of items i through iv was to record a gain of million  net of tax  as a cumulative effect adjustment of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of operations upon adoption on january  the company has no material assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling its decommissioning liabilities other than million of restricted cash held in escrow included in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
revenue recognition the company typically earns the majority of deepwater and shelf contracting revenues during the summer and fall months 
revenues are derived from billings under contracts which are typically of short duration that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
the company recognizes revenue as it is earned at estimated collectible amounts 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment charges contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as amounts are earned in accordance with contract terms 
revenues generated in the pre operation mode before a contract commences are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis in accordance with contract terms 
direct and incremental costs associated with pre operation activities are similarly deferred and recognized over the estimated contract period 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion  or achievement of certain contractual milestones if provided for in the contract 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
the company recognizes additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 
unbilled revenue represents revenue attributable to work completed prior to year end which has not yet been invoiced 
all amounts included in unbilled revenue at december  are expected to be billed and collected within one year 
the company records revenues from the sales of crude oil and natural gas when delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when production has been delivered to a pipeline or a barge lifting has occurred 
the company may have an interest with other producers in certain properties 
in this case the company uses the entitlements method to account for sales of production 
under the entitlements method the company may receive more or less than its entitled share of production 
if the company receives more than its entitled share of production  the imbalance is treated as a liability 
if the company receives less than its entitled share  the imbalance is recorded as an asset 
as of december  the net imbalance was a million asset and was included in 
table of contents other current assets million and accrued liabilities million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount net of write offs and allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the company establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less that the outstanding historical balance or when the company has determined the balance will not be collected 
foreign currency the functional currency for the company s foreign subsidiaries  well ops uk limited and helix energy limited  is the applicable local currency british pound 
results of operations for these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using average exchange rates during the period 
assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustment  which was an unrealized loss in of million and an unrealized gain in of million  and is included as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as a component of shareholders equity 
beginning in  deferred taxes have not been provided on foreign currency translation adjustments for operations where the company considers its undistributed earnings of its principal non us subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
as a result  cumulative deferred taxes on translation adjustments totaling approximately million were reclassified from noncurrent deferred income taxes and accumulated other comprehensive income 
all foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized currently in the statements of operations 
canyon offshore  the company s rov subsidiary  has operations in the europe west africa and asia pacific regions 
canyon conducts the majority of its affairs in these regions in us dollars which it considers the functional currency 
when currencies other than the us dollar are to be paid or received the resulting gain or loss from translation is recognized in the statements of operations 
these amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively  were not material to the company s results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for price risk management activities the company s price risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures primarily related to our oil and gas production 
all derivatives are reflected in our balance sheet at their fair market value 
there are two types of hedging activities hedges of cash flow exposure and hedges of fair value exposure 
the company engages primarily in cash flow hedges 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred to the extent that they are effective and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in value is recognized immediately in earnings in oil and gas production revenues 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness 
all hedging instruments are linked to the hedged asset  liability  firm commitment or forecasted transaction 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge or it is probable that a hedged transaction will not occur 
if hedge accounting is discontinued  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instruments are recognized in earnings immediately 
the fair value of hedging instruments reflects our best estimate and is based upon exchange or over the counter quotations whenever they are available 
quoted valuations may not be available due to location 
table of contents differences or terms that extend beyond the period for which quotations are available 
where quotes are not available  we utilize other valuation techniques or models to estimate market values 
these modeling techniques require us to make estimations of future prices  price correlation and market volatility and liquidity 
our actual results may differ from our estimates  and these differences can be positive or negative 
during and  the company entered into various cash flow hedging swap and costless collar contracts to stabilize cash flows relating to a portion of the company s oil and gas production 
all of these qualified for hedge accounting 
the aggregate fair value of the hedge instruments was a net liability of million and  as of december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded unrealized losses gains of approximately million   and million  net of taxes of million   and  respectively  in other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity as these hedges were highly effective 
the balance in the cash flow hedge adjustments account is recognized in earnings when the hedged item is sold 
during  and  the company reclassified approximately million  million and million  respectively  of losses from other comprehensive income to oil and gas production revenues upon the sale of the related oil and gas production 
hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges was a loss of million  net of taxes of  in the third quarter of as reported in that period s earnings as a reduction of oil and gas production revenues 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted from ert s projected inability to deliver contractual oil and gas production in fourth quarter due primarily to the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita 
equity investments our equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries include our investments in deepwater gateway  llc  independence hub  llc and offshore technology solutions limited otsl  a trinidad and tobago entity 
we review our equity investments for impairment and record an adjustment when we believe the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  fair value is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
in determining whether the decline is other than temporary  we consider the cyclical nature of the industry in which the investment operates  its historical performance  its performance in relation to its peers and the current economic environment 
we will monitor the fair value of our investments for impairment and will record an adjustment if we believe a decline is other than temporary 
during  and no impairment indicators existed 
income taxes deferred income taxes are based on the difference between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company utilizes the liability method of computing deferred income taxes 
the liability method is based on the amount of current and future taxes payable using tax rates and laws in effect at the balance sheet date 
income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company considers the undistributed earnings of its principal non us subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
at december   the company s principal non us subsidiaries had an accumulated deficit of approximately million in earnings and profits 
these losses are primarily due to timing differences related to fixed assets 
the company has not provided deferred us income tax on the losses 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of net operating loss carry forwards and deferred income taxes 
worker s compensation claims our onshore employees are covered by worker s compensation 
offshore employees  including divers  tenders and marine crews  are covered by our maritime employers liability insurance policy which covers jones act exposures 
the company incurs worker s compensation claims in the normal course of business  which management believes are substantially covered by insurance 
the company  its insurers and legal counsel analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate liability of each claim

 the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share eitf  which is effective for reporting periods ending after december  contingently convertible instruments within the scope of eitf are instruments that contain conversion features that are contingently convertible or exercisable based on a a market price trigger or b multiple contingencies if one of the contingencies is a market price trigger for which the instrument may be converted or share settled based on meeting a specified market condition 
eitf requires companies to include shares issuable under convertible instruments in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger or other contingent feature has been met 
in addition  prior period earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes must be restated 
the company adopted eitf in the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s earnings per share for the years ended december   and results of operations in the fourth quarter of  we modified our segment reporting from three reportable segments to four reportable segments 
our operations are conducted through the following primary reportable segments deepwater contracting  shelf contracting  oil and gas production and production facilities 
the realignment of reportable segments was attributable to organizational changes within the company as it is related to separating marine contracting into two reportable segments deepwater contracting and shelf contracting 
deepwater contracting operations include deepwater pipelay  well operations and robotics 
shelf contracting operations consist of assets deployed primarily for diving related activities and shallow water construction 
as a result  segment disclosures for and have been restated to conform to the current period presentation 
all intercompany transactions between the segments have been eliminated 
comparison of years ended and revenues 
during the year ended december   the company s revenues increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  of the overall million increase  million was generated by the deepwater contracting segment  million by the shelf contracting segment and million generated by the oil and gas production segment 
deepwater contracting revenues increased million from million for to million for due primarily to improved market demand resulting in significantly improved utilization rates and contract pricing for all divisions within the segment deepwater  well operations and rovs 
shelf contracting revenues increased million from million for to million for also due to improved market demand  much of which was the result of damages sustained in hurricanes katrina and rita 
this resulted in significantly improved utilization rates and contract pricing for all divisions within the segment shallow water pipelay  diving and portable sat systems 
further  shelf 
table of contents contracting s revenues increased in compared with directly as a result of the acquisition of the torch and stolt vessels in the third and fourth quarter of  with much of the impact attributable to the fourth quarter 
oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million during production decreased bcfe for the year ended december  compared to bcfe in primarily due to production shut ins due to hurricanes katrina and rita in the third and fourth quarters of the average realized natural gas price of per mcf  net of hedges in place  during was higher than the per mcf realized in while average realized oil prices  net of hedges in place  increased to per barrel compared to per barrel realized during gross profit 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  represented a increase compared to the million recorded in the prior year 
deepwater contracting gross profit increased to million  for the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to improved utilization rates and contract pricing for all divisions within the segment 
shelf contracting gross profit increased to million  for the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
as previously discussed  the increase was primarily attributable to improved utilization rates and contract pricing for all divisions within the segment 
shelf contracting gross profit in was impacted by asset impairments on certain vessels totaling million for conditions meeting the company s asset impairment criteria 
oil and gas production gross profit increased million  to million  due to the aforementioned higher commodity price increases  offset by decreased production levels 
gross margins of in were points better than the in deepwater contracting margins increased points to for the year ended december   from in the prior year  due to the factors noted above 
shelf contracting margins increased points to in from in  due to the factors noted above 
in addition  margins in the oil and gas production segment decreased points to in from in  due primarily to impairment analysis on certain properties and expensed well work which resulted in million of impairments  inspection and repair costs of approximately million as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita no insurance recoveries recorded as of december   and million of expensed seismic data purchased for ert s offshore property acquisitions 
as discussed above  the company sustained damage to certain of its oil and gas production facilities in hurricanes katrina and rita 
the company estimates future total repair and inspection costs resulting from hurricanes will range from million to million  net of expected insurance reimbursement 
these costs  and any related insurance reimbursements  will be recorded as incurred over the next year 
selling administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  were million higher than the million incurred in due primarily to increased incentive compensation as a result of increased profitability 
selling and administrative expenses at of revenues for was slightly lower than the of revenues in equity in earnings of investments 
equity in earnings of the company s investment in deepwater gateway  llc increased to million in compared with million in the increase was attributable to the demand fees which commenced following the march mechanical completion of the marco polo tension leg platform  owned by deepwater gateway  llc  as well as production tariff charges which commenced in the third quarter of as marco polo began producing
