our comparable store sales performance was driven principally by increases in our dress and footwear departments

as a percentage of sales  our gross margin increased basis points to  operating margin improved basis points to and net income and diluted earnings per share increased and to million and  respectively

we also continued our program of selective store closings with the exiting of four locations 
we are currently scheduled to close four stores in the first half of fiscal and will continue to carefully evaluate the profitability of individual stores and close those stores that we believe cannot meet a level of profitability that we deem acceptable

we anticipate the large majority of the new stores will include plus sized departments as we look to grow this business and further differentiate ourselves from our competition
