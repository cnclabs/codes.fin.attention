item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements are usually accompanied by words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in item a risk factors 
overview we are an advanced medical technology company that designs  develops  manufactures and markets proprietary implant technologies that allow interventional cardiologists to treat cardiac sources of migraine headaches  stroke and other potential brain attacks through minimally invasive  catheter based procedures 
we are investigating the potential connection between a common cardiac defect  pfo  and brain attacks such as migraine headaches  stroke and transient ischemic attacks tia 
a pfo can allow venous blood  unfiltered and unmanaged by the lungs  to enter the arterial circulation of the brain  possibly triggering a cerebral event or brain attack 
in  our then new senior management team began divesting certain non strategic assets in order to focus on this emerging pfo market opportunity utilizing our proprietary implant technologies 
these divestitures included the november sale of our vena cava filter product line to bard and the july sale of our neurosciences business unit to integra 
net cash proceeds from these sales transactions of approximately million  the related net royalty income from bard that commenced in and the on going business operations have provided us with the financial and operational flexibility to aggressively pursue this emerging market opportunity with our cardioseal and starflex implants  clinical research studies and development of next generation catheter based implant technologies 
more than  pfos have been closed globally using our cardioseal and starflex implant technologies 
we are currently conducting five pfo closure related clinical research trials  focusing on pfo migraine  pfo stroke and our new proprietary biostar implant technology 
pfo migraine the prevalence of migraines in the united states is estimated to be approximately of the general population or roughly million individuals 
we estimate that of all migraine sufferers  or million individuals  have the classic form of migraine  sometimes referred to as migraine with aura 
it has also been reported that of these patients do not satisfactorily respond to current approved forms of medication 
furthermore  data as reported at the most recent transcatheter cardiovascular therapeutic symposium tct meeting in october indicated that of the patient subset in our mist trial had a right to left shunt 
that is twice what would be expected in the general population 
in  we completed enrollment in our mist study in the united kingdom 
total costs for mist are estimated to be in the range of to million  of which approximately million was incurred through study enrollment was completed in july and results are scheduled to be presented at the american college of cardiology meeting on march  in january  we commenced enrollment in mist ii  a pfo migraine ide study approved by the fda 
we currently expect completion of enrollment in early  with one year follow up evaluations 
we currently project the costs of this clinical study to be in the range of to million through in october  we received approval from the regulatory authorities in the united kingdom to begin enrollment in mist iii 
in mist iii  control patients from the original mist study  those who did not receive the 
table of contents starflex implant  have the option to receive an implant after they have been unblinded as part of the mist study 
these patients will follow the identical protocol as in mist after which they will be followed for an additional months 
in addition  migraine patients with a pfo who did receive a starflex implant in mist will be followed for an additional months 
we currently estimate the cost of mist iii to be approximately million through pfo stroke stroke is the third leading cause of death in the united states and the leading cause of disability in adults 
each year  approximately  americans suffer a new or recurrent stroke and  americans experience a tia 
in  we launched the closure i clinical trial to compare our starflex cardiac septal repair implant with current medical therapy in stroke prevention 
closure i is a  patient  prospective  randomized  multi center trial  for which we received complete ide approval from the fda in june although approximately closure i clinical sites have enrolled patients  enrollment to date has progressed much slower than anticipated 
we now believe that study changes  acceptable to the fda  the investigators and us  are necessary in order to successfully complete this study 
until these changes are approved  it is difficult to estimate the completion date 
it is currently anticipated that when completed  study data from closure i will be used to support a pfo pma application 
we currently expect that total costs for closure i will be approximately million through completion of the trial and submission to the fda 
of this total  approximately million was incurred through  and we currently project costs to be approximately million  largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
biostar and biotrek in november  we completed enrollment in our best study biostar evaluation study  which commenced in july following regulatory approval in the united kingdom 
this study is evaluating our new bioabsorbable  biological closure technology designed to promote a more natural  rapid and complete sealing of heart defects such as pfo 
approximately patients were enrolled in the best study and will be followed for six months 
the study was designed to gain commercial approval for biostar through the ce mark process 
approval is currently expected by the end of in january  we announced that we received a phase i grant from the national institute of health s nih small business technology transfer program to initiate a research program to evaluate our advanced septal repair implant called biotrek  a bioabsorbable  biological closure technology 
we believe that the biomaterials in the biostar and biotrek implants  whether used alone or in combination  further complement our current cardioseal and starflex closure technology  providing us with an exceptionally promising and well protected technology pipeline 
revenues our revenues were predominantly derived from sales of our cardioseal and starflex products in the us and europe and net royalties earned from bard 
cardioseal and starflex product sales increased by approximately from to in contrast to the approximate decrease experienced from to we believe that a combination of increased market awareness of pfo closure and targeted marketing efforts has resulted in the addition of new customers  predominantly in the united states 
we believe that the impact on us sales of stricter end user adherence to hde guidelines  specifically related to off label procedures  has stabilized 
we currently expect an approximate increase in cardioseal and starflex product sales from to net royalties  which principally apply to bard s worldwide sales of snf and rnf products  were reported net of royalties payable to the estate of the original inventor 
net royalty income from bard increased approximately from to  primarily as a result of increased sales of the rnf product  for which bard received fda regulatory approval for commercial sales and use as of december  we currently expect net royalty income earned from bard to remain consistent with levels 
we currently do not anticipate any other material sources of revenues in 
table of contents we ended with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  providing us with what we believe is the financial strength and flexibility to complete our clinical research initiatives and to continue to invest in additional research and development programs  regulatory activities and commercial sales efforts  including planned headcount and territory expansion in europe 
critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our results of operations and the valuation of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results of operations cannot be made with certainty  and are made based on our experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or as additional information is obtained 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  our most critical accounting policies  described below  include i revenue recognition  ii accounts receivable reserves  iii inventories  and iv expenses associated with clinical trials 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we use judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria  particularly with respect to collectibility 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we require receipt of official purchase orders for all customer orders for our products 
prior to fulfillment of a customer order  we review that customer s account history and outstanding balances to determine if we believe that collectibility of the order value is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment unless customer purchase orders specifically designate that title to the products transfers upon receipt 
products sold to distributors  which accounted for approximately of our product sales in  are not subject to a right of return for unsold product 
we recognize royalty income as it is earned in accordance with relevant contract provisions 
where applicable  we report royalty income in our financial statements net of corresponding royalty obligations to third parties 
accounts receivable reserves we provide allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing these allowances  we make assumptions with respect to the future collectibility of our receivable balances 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality  primarily its payment history  as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  we determine the probability of customer default  the appropriateness of our current reserve balance and the need to record a charge or credit to operating expense to increase or decrease our 
table of contents reserve level 
the amount of the reserve level for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of these factors 
if our assumptions are incorrect  or if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  we may need to make additional allowances 
we also maintain a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventories in accordance with sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of production be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
management judgment will be required in the determination of a range of normal capacity levels  which will directly affect the allocation of fixed manufacturing overhead costs between inventory costs and period expense 
based upon increased inventory levels in  primarily the result of lower than expected closure i enrollment and the effects of stricter adherence to hde guidelines regarding off label usage  we scaled back our implant device production below normalized capacity levels 
the resulting excess idle capacity costs charged directly to cost of product sales as period costs during totaled approximately  inventory levels at the end of decreased by approximately compared to based upon projected increases in demand  both for commercial sales and clinical trial enrollments  we currently anticipate increased production levels approximating normal capacity levels 
in addition  as a manufacturer of medical devices  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
in such an event  we would need to take a charge against earnings upon making such a determination 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when we believe that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
the assumptions we use in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case any provision required for excess or obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted 
if we determine that our inventory is overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs as cost of goods sold at the time of that determination and such recognition could have a significant impact on our reported operating results 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
expenses associated with clinical trials we have invested significant resources in several clinical trials designed to investigate the potential connection between a pfo and brain attacks such as migraine headaches  strokes and tias 
mist ii  an ide study approved by the fda in the fourth quarter of and for which patient enrollment has been initiated in january  is our second pfo migraine trial 
prior to that  we completed enrollment in july for mist in the united kingdom 
in october  we announced approval of mist iii 
our closure i trial  commenced in  is an fda approved ide study in the us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the starflex closure technology to prevent a recurrent embolic stroke and or tia in patients with a pfo 
in november  we completed enrollment in the best study 
total expenses for all of our clinical trials were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents our judgment is required in determining methodologies used to recognize various costs related to our clinical trials 
we generally enter into contracts with vendors who render services over an extended period of time 
typically  we enter into three types of vendor contracts i time based  ii patient based  or iii a combination thereof 
under a time based contract  using critical factors contained within the contract  usually the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided  we record the contractual expense for each service provided under the contract ratably over the period during which we estimate the service will be performed 
under a patient based contract  we first determine an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract  which include the estimated number of patients and the total dollar value of the contract 
we then record the expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled and or monitored during the period 
on a quarterly basis  we review both the timetable of services to be rendered and the timing of services actually rendered 
based upon this review  revisions may be made to the forecasted timetable or to the extent of services performed  or both  in order to reflect our most current estimate of the contract 
adjustments are recorded in the period in which the revisions are estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
additional starflex and biostar products manufactured to accommodate the expected requirements of our clinical trials are included in inventory because they are saleable units with alternative use outside of the trials 
these units will be expensed as a cost of the trials as they are implanted 
substantially all expenses related to our clinical trials are included in research and development in our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents the increase in cardioseal and starflex implant sales for compared to was a result of increased product demand in the united states and canada 
we believe that a combination of increased market awareness of pfo closure and targeted marketing efforts has resulted in the addition of new customers 
the decrease in european sales was primarily attributable to increased clinical programs throughout europe 
however  we believe that the combination of our mist study and headcount investments in the uk and other planned investments in europe have increased awareness of pfo closure in that market 
incremental strengthening of the us dollar in also had a slight unfavorable effect on european product sales 
european sales represented approximately and of total cardioseal and starflex product sales in and  respectively 
pending the mist study data results expected in march and the potential awarding of the ce mark for biostar later in  we currently believe that our european product sales will increase compared to current year levels 
management currently anticipates between growth in cardioseal and starflex product sales in compared to  with european sales projected to approximate of the total 
we believe that  given the regulatory environment in the us  sales in north america will remain flat 
however  it is uncertain if  and to what extent  enrollment in mist ii and an anticipated increase in closure i patient enrollment will affect the level of us sales 
if our hde approval for pfo were to be deactivated by the fda  that loss would potentially cause a material reduction in us sales  resulting in significant operating losses based upon our current operational structure 
we currently expect that planned european headcount growth and territory expansion during will result in approximately growth in european product sales 
if the mist study data results  currently expected in march  are favorable  we believe such a demonstration of clinical relevance of pfo closure in certain migraine patients in europe could result in further demand for our pfo closure technologies in additionally  relative weakening or strengthening of the us dollar will have a favorable or unfavorable impact  respectively  on european product sales 
the increase in net royalty income for was directly attributable to bard s sales of its rnf product  for which it received fda regulatory approval for commercial sale and use as of december  the net royalty income from bard was recorded net of approximately million of royalties payable to the estate of the original inventor of snf and rnf products 
although we currently anticipate that net royalties earned from bard to remain consistent in compared with levels  that result is largely dependent upon continued market acceptance and penetration of its rnf product 
as expected  net royalty income from bsc related to the exclusive license of our stent technology decreased further from to bsc is not prohibited from selling competing stents and has established a broad based stent program 
we currently anticipate that future royalties earned from bsc will remain flat or decline compared to levels 
cost of product sales 
the increase in cost of product sales  as a percentage of total product sales  was primarily due to production volumes below normalized plant capacity levels 
as a result  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 inventory costs  a portion of our fixed manufacturing overhead costs were not absorbed as part of inventory unit costs  but instead were charged to cost of product sales in the period incurred 
included in cost of product sales were royalty expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
with production levels projected to increase to normalized plant capacity levels  we do not currently anticipate that a portion of our fixed manufacturing overhead will be charged as a period expense 
additionally  an anticipated higher proportion of european sales in compared to are expected to result in a lower weighted average selling price for our products 
as a result of these contrasting trends  we currently expect cost of product sales  as a percentage of product sales  to increase slightly compared to research and development 
the increase in research and development expense was primarily related to i approximately million of increased costs related to our mist uk study  ii increased legal fees of approximately million associated with patent infringement claims and ongoing patent research  iii approximately million of technology license and product development costs related to future generation 
table of contents implant technologies  iv approximately  of costs related to our best clinical study  v increased headcount and related personnel costs of approximately  and vi approximately  of initial costs of mist ii  our us pfo migraine study for which enrollment has been initiated in january the combined costs of our clinical studies totaled approximately million in compared to approximately million in we currently expect research and development expense to increase to approximately million compared to approximately million in  an approximate increase  primarily attributable to i an approximate million increase in clinical trial costs  most notably the expected substantial completion of the enrollment phase of our new mist ii study  ii an approximate million increase in technology license and product development costs related to future generation implant technologies  iii prosecution of existing patent infringement claims and ongoing patent research  and iv increases in personnel related costs 
for additional information on clinical trials cost  refer to liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations below 
general and administrative 
the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to i increased professional fees  primarily related to corporate governance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  of approximately  ii increased stock based compensation of approximately  related to our stock option re pricing  iii and a one time k employer match of  partially offset by  iv reduced corporate legal fees of approximately  and v reduced insurance costs of approximately  general and administrative expense is currently expected to increase by approximately in compared to  principally related to estimated  non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million pursuant to the new accounting rules  effective january   prescribed by sfas r  share based payment see recent accounting pronouncements and  to a lesser degree  increased personnel and related costs 
we currently expect general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues to be approximately in compared to in selling and marketing 
the increase in selling and marketing expense was the result of i an approximate  increase in sales incentive compensation  ii an approximate  increase in personnel and related costs  iii an approximate  increase in travel and entertainment expense  and iv an approximate  increase in physician training and market research consulting services  partially offset by the elimination of approximately  of costs related to our marketing program events 
we currently expect total selling and marketing expense to increase by approximately in compared to  primarily related to planned headcount and market expansion in europe and increased marketing programs 
interest income 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher weighted average interest rates earned due to i the increased percentage of marketable securities versus cash equivalents in compared to and ii the general trend of increasing short term interest rates 
average interest bearing assets decreased by approximately million  or  during compared to we currently expect interest income to decrease by approximately in compared to  primarily related to the estimated use of to million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund operations 
income tax provision 
due to our reported net losses  we had no income tax provision in and we currently expect to incur operating losses in and  accordingly  we expect a minimal tax provision for the year ending december  income from discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately  of income from discontinued operations in connection with the final settlement of a tax claim related to our former neurosciences business unit 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately  of income from discontinued operations  primarily related to the partial recovery of a prior year judgment against us in connection with the termination of a former european employee of the neurosciences business unit

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  increase decrease change to to in thousands  except percentages product sales cardioseal and starflex north america europe other total product sales net royalty income bard bsc total net royalty income total revenues cardioseal and starflex implant sales decreased approximately million  or  from to this was entirely attributable to our product sales in north america 
we believe that this decrease was influenced primarily by stricter end user adherence to patient selection criteria prescribed by the fda s hde guidelines  specifically related to off label procedures and  to a lesser degree  by patient enrollment in our closure i clinical trial 
european sales were relatively flat from to we believe this resulted partially from the impact of mist  which was started in the second half of partially impacting sales was the weakening of the us dollar which favorably impacted product sales by approximately  european sales represented approximately and of total cardioseal and starflex product sales in and  respectively 
the substantial increase in net royalty income for was directly attributable to bard s sales of its rnf product  for which it received fda regulatory approval for commercial sale and use as of december  the net royalty income from bard was recorded net of approximately million of royalties payable to the original inventor of snf and rnf products 
as expected  net royalty income from bsc related to the exclusive license of our stent technology decreased from to bsc is not prohibited from selling competing stents and has established a broad based stent program 
cost of product sales 
the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of product sales in  compared to  was primarily due to i the impact of fixed manufacturing overhead on lower than budgeted product volumes  and ii the effect of a higher proportion of european sales  which have a lower average selling price and a higher unit product cost compared to the us this increase was partially offset by a higher european average selling price in compared to  which was due to a combination of the weakening of the us dollar and a higher proportion of direct versus distributor sales 
included in cost of product sales were royalty expenses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development 
the approximate million increase in research and development expense in compared to was predominantly related to the launch of our mist study and the full year impact of our closure i clinical trial which commenced in june additionally  increased legal costs of approximately  associated with patent research and infringement claims were offset by reductions in 
table of contents personnel related costs of approximately  clinical and regulatory costs for mist totaled approximately  closure i costs included in research and development expense increased  to approximately million in compared to approximately million in we continued to invest heavily to protect and expand our intellectual property positions  having filed in excess of utility and provisional patent applications in each of and general and administrative 
the decrease in general and administrative expense in compared to was primarily attributable to i reduced corporate legal fees of approximately  and ii lower stock based compensation of approximately  associated with our stock option re pricing 
selling and marketing 
the modest decrease in selling and marketing expense in compared to was primarily attributable to i reduced sales based commissions of approximately  and ii reduced travel expense of approximately  partially offset by costs of approximately  associated with our collaboration with the national stroke association to promote market awareness of the potential relationship between pfo and recurrent stroke 
the weakening of the us dollar during had the effect of increasing expenses incurred in europe by approximately  settlement of litigation 
during the year ended december   we incurred a charge of approximately million in connection with the settlement of an arbitration proceeding with bio tech engineering  inc bte 
the charge consisted of a  settlement payment to bte plus legal costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
the modest decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily attributable to an approximate net  reduction in interest bearing assets during  partially offset by minimally higher weighted average interest rates earned due to the change in investment mix between marketable securities and cash equivalents 
approximately million  or  of the interest bearing assets at december  were invested in marketable securities  consisting of corporate bonds and us government agency debt instruments  with scheduled maturities ranging from january through november income tax provision 
due to our reported net losses  we had no income tax provision in compared to an income tax provision of  or of loss before income taxes  in the tax provision was primarily attributable to the million of taxable income recognized upon receipt of the final bard milestone payment in january  which was recognized for financial statement purposes in  partially offset by approximately million of remaining tax loss carryforwards for which tax benefit had not been previously provided  and operating losses incurred in income from discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately  of income from discontinued operations  primarily related to the partial recovery of a prior year judgment against us in connection with the termination of a former european employee of the neurosciences business unit

the primary elements of the approximate million net change in working capital items in consisted of the following a net trade accounts receivable increased during by approximately million  or  primarily due to an increase of approximately million  or  in product sales for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of european sales accounted for approximately of product sales during the fourth quarter of compared to approximately for the fourth quarter of we currently expect trade accounts receivable to increase significantly in as a result of higher product sales  predominantly in europe 
b our inventories decreased by approximately  during  primarily as a result of planned reductions in production levels and higher than anticipated increases in product sales 
based upon currently anticipated increases in product sales  we currently expect that inventory balances will increase significantly during c prepaid expenses and other current assets increased during by approximately  this increase was primarily attributable to approximately  of advance payments to third party contractors for the mist ii clinical trial  partially offset by an approximate  decrease in accrued interest receivable related to our investments in marketable securities 
d current liabilities increased by approximately million during  primarily attributable to i an approximate million increase in mist  best and closure i cost accruals  ii an approximate million increase in accounts payable balances  principally related to increased legal fees in connection with ongoing patent infringement claims and increased accounting fees in connection with sox  iii an approximate  increase in payroll related costs  consisting of higher sales based commissions  bonuses and a one time k employer match  and iv an approximate  increase in accrued royalties  primarily related to an approximate increase in cardioseal and starflex product sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a reduction in discontinued operations liabilities of approximately  attributable to the settlement of a french tax claim related to our former neurosciences business unit 
we currently expect current liabilities to increase by in  primarily related to the mist ii and closure i clinical trials 
net cash used in operating activities for represented a decrease of approximately million compared to net cash provided by operating activities in this decrease was largely attributable to the receipt in of the final million contingent cash consideration from bard in connection with the sale of the vena cava filter product line and an approximate  increase in loss from operating activities  partially offset by a net increase in other working capital items of approximately million 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities of approximately million in consisted primarily of i approximately million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and ii an approximate million release of restricted cash balances in connection with the settlement of the french tax claim  partially

this compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately million in  which consisted primarily of approximately million of purchases of marketable securities  net of i approximately million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and ii restricted cash of approximately million to collateralize a bank guarantee issued in october in favor of the french tax authorities 
purchases of property and equipment for use in our manufacturing  research and development and general and administrative operations totaled approximately  and  for the years ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately million from to  predominantly due to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately  from to this was primarily attributable to an approximate  increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp and an approximate  reduction in payments of capital lease obligations  which were repaid in full during at december   we had no outstanding debt financing 
primarily as a result of the ongoing costs of mist ii and closure i  we expect to incur operating losses at least through the total cost of our mist ii study is currently estimated to be approximately to million through projected completion of the study in early of this amount  approximately  was incurred in and we currently expect to incur approximately million in the total cost of our closure i clinical trial is currently estimated to be approximately million through completion of the trial and submission to the fda 
of this amount  approximately million was incurred through and we currently expect to incur approximately million in  largely dependent upon the rate of patient enrollment 
capital expenditures are currently projected to total approximately million in  primarily for manufacturing and research and development equipment 
we currently believe that aggregate cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of approximately million at december  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  financing and capital expenditure requirements through at least based upon the anticipated growth in product sales in europe and the anticipated rate of enrollment in our mist ii and closure i clinical trials  we expect that the aggregate of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will approximate to million at the end of we may require additional funds for our research and product development programs  regulatory processes  preclinical and clinical testing  sales and marketing infrastructure and programs and potential licenses and acquisitions 
any additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the level of sales of our products  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments and changes in our existing research  licensing and other relationships and the terms of any collaborative  licensing and other similar arrangements that we may establish 
we do not currently have any existing line of credit arrangements 
contractual obligations clinical trials at december  we have five significant clinical trials at various stages of completion 
in connection with these trials  we have entered into various contractual obligations with third party service providers and the 
table of contents participating clinical sites 
under certain agreements  we have the right to terminate  in which case the remaining obligations would be limited to costs incurred as of that date 
including the internal costs of our clinical department and the manufacturing costs of products used  the following table provides  by trial  our current estimate of total costs to be incurred  actual cumulative costs through fiscal  our current estimates of costs and the remaining costs estimated to be incurred subsequent to the estimated total costs  as well as the timing and amounts of estimated future costs  are dependent upon a variety of factors  including the timing of patient enrollment and patient monitoring and  in the case of new clinical trials  the finalization of various third party contracts

operating leases substantially all of our existing operating leases relate to our boston  massachusetts manufacturing  research and development and administrative offices

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock 
table of contents based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in our income statement based on their fair values 
following january   pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r must be adopted no later than january  we are evaluating the effect of statement r and expect that its adoption will have a significant impact on our results of operations and earnings per share 
statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures based upon either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we currently expect to use the modified prospective method beginning with our interim report on form q for the period ending march  as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in notes k and a to our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend  in part  on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  our current best estimate for stock based compensation expense is approximately million 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
our investments are primarily short term money market accounts that are carried on our books at cost  which approximates fair market value  and us government agency and corporate debt instruments that are carried on our books at amortized cost  increased or decreased by unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  respectively  which amounts are recorded as a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
we are subject to market risk in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk is immaterial to the company 
we denominate certain product sales and operating expenses in non us currencies see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

table of contents we translate the accounts of our foreign subsidiaries in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar and  accordingly  translation gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate in effect during the period
