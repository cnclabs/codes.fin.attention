item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary during  we continued to execute on our strategy of growing the company through new product introductions  acquisitions and development of our services and maintenance business 
in april  sumtotal was released which added totalaccess  several integrations to partner s products  enhanced reporting functionality and improved scorm support to the sumtotal product that was released in december by the end of over customers had purchased or upgraded to the sumtotal x series of products 
license revenue increased by million or in as compared to primarily as a result of sales of the sumtotal x product line 
on october   we acquired pathlore for million in cash and shares of common stock 
this followed the acquisition of docent inc in with the latest acquisition we have now combined three of the larger companies in this market and have started to leverage our increased scale to grow revenue and generate cash flow from operations 
throughout the year  we continued to add resources to our service operations  increasing personnel by a total of  including from pathlore 
we used these additional resources to provide additional consulting  hosting  training and maintenance services to our customers 
as a result we were able to grow service and maintenance revenue by million  or  as compared to as a result of the additional scale  we were able to grow revenue faster than expenses  and our gross margin increased by million  or  from to due to a million  or  growth in revenue 
we kept expenses well under control with the exception of an additional million we spent on our independent registered public accounting firm  consultants and lawyers to complete our sarbanes oxley section compliance and related matters and the million provision for legal settlement 
in total  our operating expenses increased by million or from overall  we improved our net loss from million in to million in our cash flow also improved during the year and cash flow provided from operations improved by million to million for the year 
we used million of our cash to assist in the acquisition of pathlore and also entered into a credit arrangement with a large financial institution 
we borrowed million under this arrangement 
we believe that using our cash and access to loan financing to make this strategic acquisition will leverage us for ongoing growth in the future 
during the year we had a number of challenges including the delay in filing our annual report on form k and invested a lot of time and resources in implementing improved internal controls 
as a result  we believe that our report on internal controls although still showing a number of material control weaknesses  is much improved from last year 
we will continue to make further improvements in our internal controls in critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments reflect practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring charges  allowance for deferred tax assets  and business combinations 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our disclosure committee and the audit committee of our board of directors 
refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are from the sales of software licenses and products  services performed in connection with consulting agreements  maintenance and support services  and hosting arrangements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer 
allowances are provided for estimated returns  discounts and trade ins 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
for all sales  we typically use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement  depending on the nature of the transaction  as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our significant resellers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fees associated with the transaction are fixed or determinable 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  currently up to net ninety days payment terms beyond ninety days are considered to be extended terms  or if the price is subject to refund or adjustment  then we consider the fee to not be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is deferred and recognized when payments become due and payable  or the right to refund or adjustment lapses 
the determination of whether extended payment terms are fixed or determinable requires significant judgment by management  including assessing such factors as the past payment history with the individual customer and evaluating the risk of concessions over an extended payment period 
the determinations that we make can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors including the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  past transaction history with the customer  the geographic location of the customer  and the financial viability of the customer 
we do not request nor require collateral from our customers 
if we determine at the time of the transaction that collection of the fee is not reasonably assured  then all of the related revenue is deferred until the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is deemed to have occurred after payment has been received 
the determination of a customer s ability to pay requires significant judgment by management 
we use shipping documents  proof of electronic transmittal  contractual terms and conditions  and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery and or risk of loss and title passing to the customer 
for perpetual software license fees in arrangements that do not include customization or consulting services  delivery is deemed to occur when the product is shipped to the customer 
services and consulting arrangements that are not essential to the functionality of the licensed product  if any  are generally considered delivered and recognized as 
table of contents revenue as these services are provided 
delivery of time based licenses  subscription license bundles  hosting agreements and support agreements is generally considered to occur on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
our customers have the option of purchasing perpetual licenses  time based licenses  or subscription license bundles that include hosting and maintenance and support 
for perpetual software license fees in arrangements that do not include customization or consulting services  delivery typically is deemed to occur and the related revenue recognized as license revenue when the product is shipped to customers 
when perpetual license arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
fair value of hosting and maintenance and support services is based on separate sales and or renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
in the event that fair value for hosting and maintenance and support services does not exist  then revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the performance period 
our time based license sales are recognized ratably over the rental period and included as a component of license revenue 
our subscription license bundles require the license holders to pay a monthly fee which is based on the number of users 
we recognize revenue on subscription license bundles on a straight line basis over the life of the subscription and record the revenue as service and maintenance revenue 
for multiple element arrangements  when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements of the arrangement  but does not exist for one of the delivered elements in the arrangement  we recognize revenue under the residual method 
under the residual method  at the outset of the arrangement with a customer  revenue is deferred for the fair value of its undelivered elements such as consulting services and product support and upgrades  and revenue is recognized for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered  with the residual being allocated to delivered elements typically software licenses  when all of the applicable criteria in sop no 
 software revenue recognition  have been met 
company specific objective evidence is established for hosting and support and upgrades of standard products based upon the amounts we charge when support  upgrades  and hosting are sold separately 
company specific objective evidence is established for consulting and installation services based on the hourly rates we charge for our employees when they are performing these services separately and provided we have the ability to accurately estimate the hours required to complete the project based upon experience with similar projects 
many of our software contracts include consulting implementation services 
consulting revenues from certain of these contracts are accounted for separately from the perpetual license revenues because the consulting arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop no 
the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of the same services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion date or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we recognize revenue on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees and those with billing milestones to the extent that we have a basis for measuring progress to completion and provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  or if the service engagement is subject to final customer acceptance  then revenue is recognized when we have completed all our obligations and or receive final acceptance from the customer 
if we have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion and the service engagement is not subject to final customer acceptance  then revenue is recognized as the services are provided or by using input measures based on hours to complete  not to exceed milestone billings 

table of contents the cost of providing these services consists primarily of fully burdened cost of our service organization and to some extent  the cost we pay to third party contractors who provide these services on our behalf 
costs for certain projects with significant uncertainties are expensed as they are incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 research and development arrangements  and included in the cost of service revenue 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our operating results 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
professional services from time and materials contracts and training services  along with the related costs are recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from maintenance and support agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
customers with perpetual or time based licenses may also outsource to us the hosting of their system on a third party s server for a monthly fee and an initial set up fee 
we evaluate our hosting arrangements based on the criteria outlined in eitf no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
based on the criteria outlined in eitf no 
 we have determined that our hosting arrangements are within the scope of sop no 
the applicability of eitf no 
allows us to recognize that portion of the fee attributable to the license on delivery  while that portion of the fee related to the hosting element would be recognized ratably as the service is provided  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria of sop no 
have been met 
the costs of these services are recognized as incurred and included as a component in costs of services revenue 
distributors and systems integrators purchase our products for specific projects of the end user and do not hold inventory 
they perform functions that include importation  delivery to the end customer  installation or integration  and post sales service and support 
our agreements with these distributors and systems integrators have terms which are generally consistent with the standard terms and conditions for the sale of our software to end users and do not provide for product rotation or pricing allowances  as are typically found in agreements with stocking distributors 
we have long term relationships with most of these distributors and systems integrators and substantial experience with similar sales of similar products 
we have had extensive experience monitoring product returns from our domestic and international distributors and accordingly  we have concluded that the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
with respect to these sales  we evaluate the terms of sale and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and risk of loss and title have transferred 
revenue on shipments to distributors  resellers and systems integrators is generally recognized on delivery or sell in and after the end user has been identified 
we record revenues from sales of third party products net of royalties  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
furthermore  in accordance with eitf no 
 we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case by case basis to determine whether the transaction should be recorded gross or net  including but not limited to assessing whether or not we act as principal in the transaction  take title to the products  have risks and rewards of ownership  such as the risk of loss for collection  delivery  or returns  and act as an agent or broker with compensation on a commission or fee basis 
accordingly  our sales are typically recorded gross when the criteria outlined in eitf no 
are met 
deferred revenue represents advanced payments for software licenses  services  maintenance and support  and hosting arrangements in advance of the time we recognize revenue 
we expect to recognize these revenues and related costs from services ratably over the service period as these services are provided  and for licenses when all revenue recognition requirements of sop have been met 

table of contents our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
different judgments or estimates made for any one large contract  customer  or group of customers could result in material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any particular period 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
because of this assessment  which covers the sales of all our products and services  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential future estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make all of their required payments 
in making this estimate  we analyze historical payment performance  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers or any of the other factors we use to analyze credit worthiness were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  a reserve for future sales returns is also established based on historical trends in product return rates and is recorded as a reduction to our revenue and accounts receivable 
if the future actual returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values using straight line and accelerated methods designed to match the amortization to the benefits received where applicable 
they are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of goodwill is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of a reporting unit  which is a component representing a segment or one level below a segment  to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  after any adjustments required for other long lived assets  exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the unit exceeds its fair value 
purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
restructuring charges in the first and second quarters of fiscal  and in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring programs under sfas no 
 accounting for costs 
table of contents associated with exit or disposal activities 
these accruals include estimates pertaining to the ability to sublease facilities in mountain view  california  framingham  massachusetts  bellevue  washington  cupertino  california and chicago  illinois 
these estimates are reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis and  to the extent that future vacancy rates and sublease rates vary adversely from those estimates  we may incur additional losses that are not included in our accrual for vacated facilities at december  conversely  unanticipated improvements in vacancy rates or sublease rates  or termination settlements for less than our accrued amounts  may result in a reversal of a portion of the accrued balance and a benefit on our statement of operations in a future period 
such reversals would be reflected as a credit to restructuring charges 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these lease accruals are carried at their fair values  which are the net present values 
allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce all of the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized by us 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase reported income or reduce loss in the applicable period and increase stockholders equity on the balance sheet in the period such determination was made 
to the extent that such realizable deferred tax assets related to the results of the acquired company prior to the acquisition  there would be a reduction in goodwill 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the acquisitions discussed in note acquisitions and intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and include the results of operations of the acquired businesses since the date of acquisition 
net assets of the companies acquired were recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition 
sources of revenue we generate revenue from the sale of software licenses  products and performance of services to enterprises  systems integrators  reseller partners  and content providers 
to date  we have generated our license and services revenue primarily from direct sales  including referral sales by our system integrators to enterprise customers  and to a lesser extent  through resellers of our products and services 
enterprise customers have the option of purchasing perpetual licenses or renting time based licenses 
our perpetual licensees pay a one time  initial fee based on the number of users and may enter into separate annual maintenance contracts that include the right to receive periodic unspecified upgrades  error corrections  and telephone and web based support 
our time based licenses require license holders to pay a monthly fee  which is based on the number of users and includes maintenance and support 
customers with perpetual or time based licenses may also outsource to us the hosting of their system on a third party s server for a monthly fee and an initial set up fee 
in conjunction with the licensing of our software  we offer implementation and training services 
to date  most of our customer revenue has been generated by perpetual software licenses  and maintenance and consulting services 
we generate revenue from our reseller partners who purchase our products and maintenance services and resell them to our reseller partners customers 
to date  resellers have typically sold perpetual licenses of our software and annual maintenance agreements 
they usually provide additional professional services themselves  but may also resell some of our professional services 
generally  they receive a discount from our license list prices 

table of contents costs and expenses our cost of license revenue includes the amortization of intangible from acquired and developed technology and the cost of third party software and content we resell 
our cost of service and maintenance revenue includes salaries and related expenses of our professional services organization and charges related to hosting activities and other third party services 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories include direct costs  such as salaries  employee benefits  travel and entertainment  and allocated communication  information technology  rent and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing expenses also include sales commissions and expenditures related to public relations  advertising  trade shows and marketing campaigns 
general and administrative expenses also include legal and financial services fees 
stock based compensation consists of amortization of unearned stock based compensation recorded in connection with stock option grants to our employees 
this amount represents the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes on the date these stock options were granted and the exercise price of those options  if lower 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity on our balance sheet and is being amortized on an accelerated basis by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  consistent with the method described in fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
history of losses we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products and to build our engineering  sales  marketing  professional services and administration departments

table of contents the increase of million in total revenue for the year ended december  over the year ended december  is due mainly to sequential growth in the market for our products in all regions 
the increase in sales of our sumtotal x product to new customers and additional sales  including sumtotal x upgrades to the aspen installed base was approximately million 
the acquisition of pathlore on october  added a further million of revenue 
revenue from the docent installed customer base was very similar in and  declining million 
approximately million of the additional revenue in was from sales of the docent software platform and services and approximately million was from additional sales of the aspen software platform and services 
for the year ended december   revenue from the americas grew million or  and accounted for approximately of total revenue 
approximately million of the increase is the result of the pathlore acquisition in the fourth quarter of with an increase of million or growth from being the result of strong sales of the sumtotal x product suite and related services 
we were successful in winning and completing installations during the year of a number of large enterprise wide solutions and also generated consulting revenue from existing customers upgrading their legacy systems to sumtotal x growth was slower in europe and asia pacific 
after very strong growth in  revenue in europe increased by million or 
the business activity levels appeared to be lower in europe than the americas and our focus was on building up our infrastructure so that we could support the large increase in our customer base that we achieved in and as a result the growth rate was relatively low compared to the americas 
asia pacific revenue increased by million or and included one large sale in japan 
for the year ended december   revenue from the americas increased million or primarily as a result of adding the docent product suite to our portfolio 
revenue from europe sales increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue for asia pacific increased million or to million 
together these two regions accounted for approximately of total revenue 
the increase in international revenue was due to a greater international presence resulting from the acquisition of docent and our success in winning a number of large contracts in  particularly in europe

license revenues from the products acquired with docent acquisition declined from million for the year ended december   to million in the year ended 
table of contents december  this was more than offset by an increase of million in license revenue from the aspen and sumtotal x product lines 
pricing levels were relatively similar between the two years 
for the year ended december   approximately million of the additional license revenue was the result of adding the docent software platform to our portfolio of products and approximately million was the result of increased sales of the clicklearn software platform and the sumtotal x series which was introduced in december price changes in per license seat prices had approximately a favorable effect on the license revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  at december   we had million in deferred license revenue  consisting of numerous contracts that should become recognizable as revenue throughout fiscal service  maintenance and other revenue 
service and maintenance revenue for the years ended december   and consisted of the following in thousands maintenance consulting hosting training application service provider for the year ended december   service and maintenance revenue increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  due to increased sales to existing customers  as well as to new customers 
approximately million of the increase was due to the acquisition of pathlore in the fourth quarter of maintenance revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase resulted from having a full year of revenue from docent customers in as compared to months in and also as a result of docent customers renewing their contracts with us and the corresponding revenue flowing into the income statement at full value as opposed to the written down fair value resulting from acquisition accounting 
approximately million of the maintenance revenue increase is due to the addition of the pathlore installed customer base 
the remaining million increase is the result of sales to new customers during and consulting revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  additional services to the docent installed base increased by million primarily as a result of having a full year s revenue as opposed to months in we also recorded an additional million of consulting revenue due to the addition of the pathlore installed customer base

table of contents training revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase results almost entirely from the sale of training services to new customers and existing customers upgrading to our sumtotal product 
approximately million of the training revenue increase is due to the addition of the pathlore installed customer base 
application service provider revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   none of which was attributable to the pathlore acquisition 
this was primarily the result of adding new customers

cost of license 
included in this category are the costs of third party licenses that we purchase and resell to our customers 
this includes virtual classroom server  performance management software and elearning content that customers choose to buy from us rather than directly from the third party because of the integration that we provide to our own products 
the elearning content revenue has not varied much from year to year and the costs run at approximately million to million per year 
in  in addition we had a large performance management sale in the fourth quarter with a cost of approximately million and in  we had a large virtual classroom sale in the second quarter with a cost of approximately million 
cost of service and maintenance 
our cost of service and maintenance revenue includes salaries and related expenses of our professional services organization and charges related to hosting activities and other third party service providers 
for the year ended december   costs increased million from million in to million in million of the increase was the result of getting a full year s expense in for the approximately thirty six docent employees that were added with the acquisition of docent on march  as well as a full year s expense for hosting and other services associated with the docent installed base 
a further million of the increase resulted from the addition of forty one pathlore service and maintenance personnel and other associated costs on october  excluding these changes that were the result of acquisitions  the balance of the increase in expense in compared to was million 
this was made up of an increase of million in salaries and related expenses for sixty three additional employees hired during mainly in latter part of the year  an increase of approximately million in travel  equipment and software and other expenses to support the increased business volume partially offset by a decrease of million in outside services as a result of less use of third party consultants and the ongoing transition of the docent hosting business from a third party supplier to our in house hosting facility 
the increase of million in over to million from million is primarily due to the addition of an average of thirty six docent service and maintenance personnel following the merger with docent on march  this accounted for approximately million 
in addition  we incurred expenses of million associated with providing hosting services for the docent customer installed base and million for additional implementation third party consulting costs associated with docent product implementations 

table of contents amortization of intangibles 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalized certain project costs recorded after technological feasibility was established on our virtual classroom server vcs product  such costs started to be amortized when the product was released on april  we recorded amortization expenses under sfas no 
of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on october   we acquired pathlore and assigned a fair value of million to acquired intangibles assets 
on march   we acquired docent  inc and assigned a fair value of million to acquired intangibles assets 
these are being amortized over periods from one year to six years based on the estimated cash flows from the underlying assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we make judgments about the recoverability of acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an indication of impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of intangible assets  we make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business to which the asset relates and typically estimated future cash flows to be generated by these businesses 
we recorded amortization expenses under sfas no 
of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangibles decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a million expense decrease in amortization of the intelliprep intangible which expired in and a million expense decrease in the docent customer contract intangible which expired in  offset by new pathlore intangibles amortization of million and increases in other intangibles amortization expense of approximately million 
the increase for the year ended december  over is due to million of additional amortization associated with our vcs product and million of amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired as a result of the merger with docent and asset purchase agreements with sales distributors in japan and australia  where we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of two foreign sales distributors and settled all disputes regarding exclusive sales agreements in both regions

gross margin for license  inclusive of amortization of intangible assets  fluctuated more widely at  and  due to the fluctuations in intangible asset amortization described above 
gross margin for service and maintenance increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  fiscal was adversely affected by the impact of the acquired docent maintenance revenue being written down to fair value as part of acquisition accounting principles 
fiscal was favorably impacted by million as these contracts renewed at full value 
this had the impact of improving the overall service margin to 
there was a further increase as we grew revenue at a faster rate than expenses as the result of our ongoing efforts to benefit from economies of scale as well as productivity improvements and by making use of our own employees instead of more expensive third party consultants 
gross margin for service and maintenance decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december   primarily due to the addition of an average of thirty six docent service and maintenance personnel following the merger with docent on march  and due to approximately million of service and maintenance deals in the year ended december  that we could not record as revenue due to merger accounting principles 
we expect improvements in gross margin for service and maintenance as more maintenance renewal contracts are signed for the installed customer base  as we sell additional hosting contracts to allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure and more customers purchase consulting services

this includes million in additional employee and related costs associated with approximately twenty six additional headcount as a result of hiring 
a further increase of million was the result of the pathlore acquisition in the fourth quarter of  which added ten employees

table of contents provision for legal settlement 
on march   we entered into an agreement to settle all patent infringement claims with iplearn that included  among other terms  a binding mutual release of all claims the parties may have had against each other  certain licenses and covenants not to sue  payment from us to iplearn of million  payable over three years  and the issuance of  shares of sumtotal systems common stock to iplearn  for a total settlement of million 
the settlement was reached with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by any party 
refer to note subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established 
development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage 
to date  software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant  and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expenses 
we assigned million to acquired in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and wrote off these assets in the docent acquisition in accordance with fin no 
 applicability of fasb no 
 business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
to estimate the value of the ipr d  we calculated the expected cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the ipr d 
these cash flows considered the contribution of the core and developed technologies  the risks related to the development of the ipr d and the percent complete as of the valuation date as well as the expected life cycle of the technology 
finally  the cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the ipr d  net of the core and developed technologies contribution  were discounted to their present value  using a discount rate of  to estimate the value of the ipr d

stock based compensation 
the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb  has been applied to account for our fixed plan stock options 
under this method  compensation expense is recorded only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
as allowed by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above and have adopted only the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and will continue to do so in the future under sfas no 
r 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we 
table of contents also selected the prospective method of adoption  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r 
the effective date of the new standard for our consolidated financial statements is our first fiscal quarter of upon adoption  this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net loss within our footnotes as is our current practice found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts disclosed within our footnotes are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will be expensed upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r may differ from amounts currently disclosed within our footnotes based on changes in the fair value of our common stock  changes in the number of options granted or the terms of such options  the treatment of tax benefits and changes in interest rates or other factors 
in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we may choose to use a different valuation model to value the compensation expense associated with employee stock options 
on may   the board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share previously awarded to its employees  including its section officers  under each of our equity compensation plans 
this approval was based on a recommendation of the compensation committee of the board of directors  which consists entirely of independent directors  and reflects an approximate premium over the average closing price of our common stock over the previous ninety trading days 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of may  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock  or of our outstanding unvested options   of which are held by section officers became exercisable on august   upon our compliance with nasdaq and sec rules 
the purpose of the acceleration is to enable us to avoid recognizing the future compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  which  when effective  will require all share based payments to employees  including granting of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense on our consolidated statement of operations  rather than as a disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  based on their fair values 
sfas no 
r will become effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the pre tax charge to be avoided amounts to approximately million over the course of the remainder of the original vesting periods  which  on average  is approximately years from january  the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on us gaap because they had exercise prices in excess of the price of our common stock at the date of acceleration 
we also believe that because the options to be accelerated have exercise prices in excess of the current market value of our common stock  the options have limited economic value and are not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 

table of contents the following table displays the impact to the net loss if we were to change our accounting policy in accordance with sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and retroactively restate all prior periods as if we had adopted sfas no 
for all periods presented in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net loss  as reported add stock based employee compensation expenses included in reported net loss  net of taxes deduct stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  including the fair value of the acceleration of common stock options  net of taxes pro forma net loss weighted average common shares outstanding  basic and diluted net loss per share  basic and diluted as reported pro forma the weighted average fair value of options granted was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we calculated the value of stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions set forth in the following table for the years ended december   and  respectively options employee stock purchase plan dividend yield volatility risk free interest rates expected lives of options years years years months months years these pro forma amounts may not be representative of the effects on reported net loss for future years as options vest over several years and additional awards are generally made each year 
the above model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which greatly affect the calculated values 
in  we recorded  in stock based compensation expense relating to the issuance of restricted stock to certain executive officers  per fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation   in stock based compensation expense relating to unvested in the money common stock options assumed as a result of the docent acquisition   in stock based compensation expense relating to extending the expiration date on stock options for employees who terminated during the period when we were not in compliance with the sec filing requirements and were therefore unable to exercise their stock options  and  in stock based compensation expenses related to fully vested options issued below fair market value 
in  we recognized  in stock based compensation expense relating to increasing the amount of shares available for purchase in the sumtotal systems employee stock purchase plan during an open offering period  per eitf no 
 accounting for increased share authorizations in an irs section employee stock purchase plan under apb opinion no 
this was result of sumtotal systems adopting the former clicklearn plan on march  and increasing the number of shares available for purchase from  
table of contents shares to  shares during the middle of an offering period and thus changing the terms of the purchase during the period 
we also recorded  in stock based compensation expense relating to unvested in the money common stock options assumed as a result of the docent acquisition and  in stock based compensation expense relating to accelerated option vesting for certain employees

equity in losses of an affiliate 
equity in losses of an affiliate related to clicklearn japan kk  our former joint venture with softbank media marketing corporation  softbank publishing inc and toppan forms co

for the years ended december  and  our equity in losses of an affiliate were  and  respectively 
as part of the agreement with softbank media marketing corporation  softbank publishing inc and toppan forms co

on august   we transferred our shares in clicklearn japan kk to softbank media and marketing and as a result we will not have any future equity related expenses relating to the losses of this company 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we incurred operating losses for all periods from inception through december   and therefore have not recorded a provision for us income taxes 
we recorded a provision for foreign income taxes of  for   for  and zero for as of december   sumtotal systems had nol carry forwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million and for state tax purposes of approximately million 
upon future realization of the deferred tax assets acquired in certain business combinations  million of the valuation allowance will be allocated first to reduce goodwill and non current intangible assets  and then to income tax expense 
our ability to utilize net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial limitation due to the change in ownership  as defined in the internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
the federal and state tax loss carry forwards are available to reduce future taxable income and expire at various dates  if not utilized 
we estimate that approximately million of the nols will not be utilizable because of internal revenue code section limitations 
deferred tax assets have been reflected in the financial statements and are accounted for in note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets as of december  has been established to reflect these uncertainties 
for further discussion of our net deferred tax assets  refer to note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
in addition we had million available under our revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc wells fargo foothill 
this availability represented a decrease from million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments on december  the change in cash is due primarily to the million of cash used in the acquisition of pathlore and acquisition related expenses  partially offset by the million in borrowings from our credit facility 
net cash provided in operating activities was million for the year ended december   which was an increase of million from million in this increase was the result of an improvement in our net loss partially offset by smaller adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities and less cash generated form changes in assets and liabilities 
net loss improved from million in to million in this was an improvement as we grew our revenue and successfully achieved the synergies from our two acquisitions during the and fiscal included a relatively high level of non cash items associated with the acquisition of docent  as a result of both purchase accounting and follow on integration activities 
the larger non cash expense reductions included million in in process research and development  million reduction in stock based compensation  million in amortization of activities  all higher in primarily as a result of purchase accounting associated with the docent acquisition  and then a million reduction in provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts  million reduction in loss on fixed asset disposals  and million reduction in equity in losses of an affiliate which were all higher charges essentially related to integration activities

cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  due primarily to the million of cash used to purchase pathlore and million in purchases of property and equipment  offset by million in net sales of short term investments 
the amount used in purchases of property and equipment was up substantially from from million as a result of our investment in building up our hosting and research and development infrastructure at our bellevue office and expansions in our india and uk offices 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  due to a million term loan under our credit facility at wells fargo foothill  million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercises of common stock options and is partially offset by the million payment of the note payable acquired from pathlore 
we entered into the credit facility to assist in the funding of the pathlore acquisition and to provide funds for general operating purposes 
concurrent with the closing of the pathlore acquisition on october   we entered into a credit facility with wells fargo foothill  principally to fund a portion of the acquisition price  and to provide for its ongoing working capital requirements 
under the terms of the facility  wells fargo foothill loaned us million to complete the acquisition of pathlore the term loan and provided a revolving credit facility to a maximum of million the revolver to meet the working capital requirements of the business 
the amounts outstanding bear interest at wells fargo foothill s base rate plus  unless we elect to be charged at the london interbank offered rate libor rate plus

there is no test of the financial covenants if the company maintains a minimum balance of at least million between qualified cash accounts accounts pledged to the lender and excess availability under the revolver 
as of december   we had million comprising million in qualified cash accounts and million in excess availability under the revolver and therefore no test of the covenants was required

these contracts typically have terms of twelve months  therefore we recognize the revenue ratably over their life 
when the contracts expire  we contact the client and request renewal  starting the deferred revenue cycle again 
we anticipate that our current forecasts for revenue based on our deferred revenue balances  backlog and sales pipeline less our current expense projections will generate sufficient cash flows to meet our presently anticipated working capital  capital expense and business expansion requirements and also to cover payments required under the term loan and other commitments discussed above over the next twelve months 
we also believe that our medium term business plans will generate sufficient cash flows to cover our loan and other commitment in the subsequent years shown in the contractual commitments table above 
pursuant to the terms of the loan from wells fargo foothill  payments of million plus interest are due on the first day of each quarter commencing january  we will continue to monitor our cash and liquidity and will seek additional financing or make additional expense reductions if it becomes required

table of contents employee stock options our stock option program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
our cumulative potential dilution for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the year  net of options forfeited by employees leaving us  divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year

eitf no 
provides that the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased significantly after the inception of a lease be the shorter of the useful life of the assets  or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
we hold our assets primarily in cash and cash equivalents  such as short term marketable debt securities  money market funds and other cash equivalents and short term investments such as commercial paper  publicly traded common stock and treasury notes 
we minimize risk by investing in financial instruments with original maturities of less than one year 
as a result  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments would not change by a material amount 
concurrent with the closing of the pathlore acquisition on october   we entered into a credit facility with wells fargo foothill  principally to fund a portion of the acquisition price  and to provide for our ongoing working capital requirements 
under the terms of the facility  wells fargo foothill loaned us million to complete the acquisition of pathlore and provided a revolving credit facility to a maximum of million to meet the working capital requirements of the business 
the amounts outstanding bear interest at wells fargo foothill s base rate plus  unless we elect to be charged at the libor rate plus 
as of december   we have elected to be charged at the libor rate  which was on december   resulting in a total interest rate of 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniform by from current levels at december   our interest payments on the credit facility over the term of the loan would not change by a material amount 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we have foreign currency risk as a result of foreign subsidiary activities 
for the years ended december   and  international revenue from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenue 
all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 

table of contents our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the us are charged to the foreign subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the us we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated in us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and zero  respectively 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
we have not entered into any forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event that our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures in the future
