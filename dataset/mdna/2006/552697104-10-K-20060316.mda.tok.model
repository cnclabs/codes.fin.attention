item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources  for a more detailed discussion of these amendments to the credit facility 
the company is currently in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of its amended credit facility  and management believes that the company will be in compliance with covenants over the next twelve months 
if  however  events were to occur which result in mdc losing all or a substantial portion of its lines of credit under the credit facility  mdc would be required to seek other sources of liquidity 
if mdc was unable to replace this source of liquidity  its ability to fund its working capital needs and any contingent obligations with respect to put options would be adversely affected 
mdc may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions mdc may make in the future 
mdc s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the marketing communications services industry 
mdc intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing  either of which may increase its leverage ratios  or by issuing equity  which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders 
at any given time mdc may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more material acquisitions 
these opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by mdc 
although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions  the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of its securities 
the success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses into mdc s current operations  including the recent zyman group acquisition 
such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties  including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings  the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company 
mdc may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions  or any future acquisitions 
mdc s business could be adversely affected if it loses key clients 
mdc s strategy has been to acquire ownership stakes in diverse marketing communications businesses to minimize the effects that might arise from the loss of any one client or executive 
the loss of one or more clients could materially affect the results of individual companies within the marketing communication group 
management succession is very important to the ongoing results of mdc s marketing communications group because  as in any service business  the success of a particular agency is dependent upon the leadership of key executives and management personnel 
if key executives were to leave  the relationships that mdc has with its clients could be lost 
within the secure products international group  the postage stamp business derives a significant portion of its revenue from government contracts  which are generally awarded in a competitive bidding process 
the loss of any of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the sales and earnings of ashton potter  mdc s postage stamp production subsidiary 
mdc s ability to generate new business from new and existing clients may be limited 
to increase its revenues  mdc needs to obtain additional clients or generate additional demand for its services from existing clients 
mdc s ability to generate initial demand for its services from new clients and additional demand from existing clients is subject to such clients and potential clients requirements  pre existing vendor relationships  financial condition  strategic plans and internal resources  as well as the quality of mdc s employees  services and reputation and the breadth of its services 
to the extent mdc cannot generate new business from new and existing clients due to these limitations  it will limit mdc s ability to grow its business and to increase its revenues 
mdc s revenues are susceptible to declines as a result of general adverse economic developments 
the marketing communications services industry is cyclical and is subject to the negative effects of economic downturns 
mdc s advertising and marketing services subsidiaries and affiliates  and its secure products international group  are also exposed to the risk of clients changing their business plans and or reducing their marketing budgets 
as a result  if the us and canadian economies weaken  our businesses  financial condition and operating results are likely to be adversely affected 
mdc s business could be adversely affected if it loses or fails to attract key employees 
employees  including creative  research  media  account and practice group specialists  and their skills and relationships with clients  are among mdc s most important assets 
an important aspect of mdc s competitiveness is its ability to retain key employee and management personnel 
compensation for these key employees is an essential factor in attracting and retaining them  and mdc may not offer a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain these key employees 
if mdc fails to hire and retain a sufficient number of these key employees  it may not be able to compete effectively 
mdc is exposed to the risk of client media account defaults 
mdc s marketing communications group often incurs expenses on behalf of its clients in order to secure a variety of media time and space  in exchange for which it receives a fee 
the difference between the gross cost of the media and the net revenue earned by us can be significant 
while mdc takes precautions against default on payment for these services such as advance billing of clients and have historically had a very low incidence of default  mdc is still exposed to the risk of significant uncollectible receivables from our clients 
mdc s results of operations are subject to currency fluctuation risks 
although mdc s financial results are reported in us dollars  a portion of its revenues and operating costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and other currencies  particularly the canadian dollar  may affect mdc s financial results and competitive position 
mdc is subject to regulations that could restrict its activities or negatively impact its revenues 
advertising and marketing communications businesses are subject to government regulation  both domestic and foreign 
there has been an increasing tendency in the united states on the part of advertisers to resort to litigation and self regulatory bodies to challenge comparative advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive 
moreover  there has recently been an expansion of specific rules  prohibitions  media restrictions  labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to advertising for certain products 
representatives within government bodies  both domestic and foreign  continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which  if successful  may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently mdc s revenues 
mdc is still implementing its plan to eliminate material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting 
mdc is required to review and assess its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal controls over financial reporting  pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of as disclosed more fully in item a of this annual report on form k for the year ended december   management s assessment has identified the existence of material weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
mdc is still remediating its material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting 
these weaknesses may adversely affect mdc s ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data and  by themselves or in combination  result in a more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement in or omission from its financial statements and other financial reporting will not be prevented or detected by mdc s employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
despite the ongoing dedication of significant resources to remediate these material weaknesses  mdc has determined that additional work will be required to remediate these material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting and cannot assure that these material weaknesses will be fully remediated in the near term 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting require mdc to perform additional analyses and pre and post closing procedures that  if not performed effectively  may prevent mdc from reporting its financial results in an accurate and timely manner 
as a result of such material weaknesses  mdc s internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements  including immaterial misstatements and misstatements created by collusion or fraud 
in light of these material weaknesses and the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting  management has concluded that mdc s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective 
therefore  mdc is performing additional analyses and other pre and post closing procedures to ensure that mdc s consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these procedures include monthly analytic reviews of subsidiaries financial results  and quarterly certifications by senior management of subsidiaries regarding the accuracy of reported financial information 
mdc also vigorously enforces its policies and the code of conduct applicable to its employees 
if the additional analyses and pre and post closing procedures are not performed effectively  if actions to remediate these material weaknesses are not successfully implemented or if other material weaknesses are identified in the future  mdc s ability to report its quarterly and annual financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected

the company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap of the united states of america us gaap 
however  the company has included certain non us gaap financial measures and ratios  which it believes provide useful information to both management and readers of this report in measuring the financial performance and financial condition of the company 
one such term is organic revenue  which means growth in revenues from sources other than acquisitions or foreign exchange impacts 
these measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by us gaap and  therefore  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies  nor should they be construed as an alternative to other titled measures determined in accordance with us gaap 
executive summary the company s objective is to create long term shareholder value by building market leading subsidiaries and affiliates that deliver innovative  value added marketing communications and secure transactions products and services to their clients 
management believes that long term shareholder value is maximized with an operating philosophy of perpetual partnership with proven committed industry leaders in marketing communications and secure products 
mdc manages the business by monitoring several financial and non financial performance indicators 
the key indicators that we review focus on the areas of revenues and operating expenses 
revenue growth is analyzed by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic location  existing growth by major reportable segment organic  growth from currency changes  and growth from acquisitions 
mdc conducts its businesses through two operating groups the marketing communications group and the secure products international group 
within the marketing communications group  there are three reportable operating segments strategic marketing services sms  customer relationship management crm and specialized communications services scs 
within the secure products international group  the reportable operating segments include the secure cards business scb and the secure paper business spb 
in addition  mdc has a corporate group which provides certain administrative  accounting  financial and legal functions 
marketing communications group through its operating partners in the marketing communications group  mdc provides advertising  consulting and specialized communication services to clients throughout the united states  canada  mexico and europe the operating companies within the marketing communications group earn revenue from agency arrangements in the form of retainer fees or commissions  from short term project arrangements in the form of fixed fees or per diem fees for services  and from incentives or bonuses 
additional information about revenue recognition appears in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
mdc s marketing communications group measures operating expenses in two distinct cost categories cost of services sold  and office and general expenses 
cost of services sold is primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs and direct costs related primarily to providing services 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs and administrative service costs including related employee compensation costs 
because we are a service business  we monitor these costs on a percentage of revenue basis 
cost of services sold tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenues  whereas office and general expenses  which are not directly related to servicing clients  tend to decrease as a percentage of revenue as revenues increase because a significant portion of these expenses are relatively fixed in nature 
secure products international group the secure products group provides security products and services in three primary areas electronic transaction products  such as credit  debit  telephone and smart cards  secure ticketing products  such as airline  transit and event tickets  and stamps  both postal and excise 
success in the secure products group requires companies to offer their customers innovative products  highly reliable service  and consistent delivery of highly specialized  secure products on a price competitive basis 
the company has strong relationships with its customers  has partnered with experienced management  and has invested in leading edge technology  providing it with the expertise and cost structures to meet customer needs 
mdc measures operating expenses within the secure products group in two distinct cost categories  cost of products sold  and office and general expenses 
cost of products sold is a mixture of direct labor and direct material costs 
material costs are primarily paper and petroleum based products 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs and administrative service costs including related employee compensation costs 
each product within the secure products group requires unique security development  production  and finishing characteristics 
the core value is the ability of mdc to deliver  achieve and maintain the trust clients place in the company to develop  produce  and finish products securely and accurately 
the facilities are generally segregated into a secure production facility  finishing area  and office  general and administration 
because of the nature of the products mdc produces  which require a combination of production and services  management monitors direct costs as a percentage of revenue 
a material portion of the company s costs are fixed  and therefore income can fluctuate as the production levels and timing of deliveries fluctuates 
certain factors affecting our business acquisitions and dispositions 
mdc s strategy includes acquiring ownership stakes in well managed businesses with strong reputations in the industry 
mdc has entered into a number of acquisition and disposal transactions in  and  which affected revenues  expenses  operating income and net income 
additional information regarding material acquisitions is provided in note acquisitions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
foreign exchange fluctuations 
mdc s financial results and competitive position are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  as described in item a risk factors mdc s results of operations are subject to currency fluctuation risks 
see also quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange 
further information is provided in foreign currency translation in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
seasonality 
historically  with some exceptions  the marketing communications groups fourth quarter generates the highest quarterly revenues in a year 
the fourth quarter has historically been the period in the year in which the highest volumes of media placements and retail related consumer marketing occur 
other important factors that could affect our results of operations are set forth in item a risk factors 
as of the quarter ended september   the company changed the composition of its reportable segments as set out in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
accordingly  to reflect this change in composition  the company has restated the previously reported segment information for the comparable periods in and to reflect this changed segment composition

management estimates  assuming that the subsidiaries owned by the company at december   perform over the relevant future periods at their earnings levels  that these rights  if all exercised  could require the company  in future periods  to pay an aggregate amount of approximately million to the owners of such rights to acquire such ownership interests in the relevant subsidiaries 
of this amount  the company is entitled  at its option  to fund approximately million by the issuance of the company s class a shares 
the ultimate amount payable and the incremental operating income in the future relating to these transactions will vary because it is dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses and the timing of when these rights are exercised 
approximately million of the estimated million that the company would be required to pay subsidiaries minority shareholders upon the exercise of outstanding put rights  relates to rights exercisable within the next twelve months 
see item a risk factors 
the following table summarizes the potential timing of the consideration and incremental operating income before depreciation and amortization based on assumptions as described above 
consideration thereafter total millions cash shares incremental operating income before depreciation and amortization of this  approximately million has been recognized in minority interest on the company s balance sheet as of september  in conjunction with the consolidation of cpb as a variable interest entity 
see note this financial measure is presented because it is the basis of the calculation used in the underlying agreements relating to the put rights and is based on forecasted operating results 
approximately million of the estimated million that the company could be required to pay subsidiaries minority shareholders upon the exercise of outstanding put option rights relates to rights exercisable in in respect of the securities of seven subsidiaries 
approximately  million of put option relating to two subsidiaries have been exercised in and will be settled during the company expects to fund the acquisition of these interests  if and when they become due  through the use of cash derived from operations  bank borrowings and or other external sources of financing 
the acquisition of any equity interest in connection with the potential exercise of these rights in will not be recorded in the company s financial statements until equity ownership is transferred 
guarantees in connection with certain dispositions of assets and or businesses in and  the company has provided customary representations and warranties whose terms range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
the company has also retained certain liabilities for events occurring prior to sale  relating to tax  environmental  litigation and other matters 
generally  the company has indemnified the purchasers in the event that a third party asserts a claim against the purchaser that relates to a liability retained by the company 
these types of indemnification guarantees typically extend for several years 
in connection with the sale of the company s investment in cdi  the amounts of indemnification guarantees are limited to the total sale price of approximately million 
for the remainder  the company s potential liability for these indemnifications are not subject to a limit as the underlying agreements do not always specify a maximum amount and the amounts are dependent upon the outcome of future contingent events 
historically  the company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no provision has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees 
the company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to guarantees and indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred  and would recognize any such losses under any guarantees or indemnifications in the period when those losses are probable and estimable 
for guarantees and indemnifications entered into after january   in connection with the sale of the company s investment in cdi  the company has estimated the fair value of its liability to be insignificant

differences in management discussion and analysis presentation under canadian gaap under canadian securities requirements  the company is required to provide supplemental information to highlight the significant differences that would have resulted in the information provided in the management s discussion and analysis had the company prepared the management s discussion and analysis using canadian gaap financial information 
the company has identified and disclosed the significant differences between canadian and us gaap as applied to its consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary gaap difference impacting the components of operating income loss is the application under canadian gaap of proportionate consolidation for investments in joint ventures in the marketing communications group businesses  while us gaap requires equity accounting for such investments 
this gaap difference does not have a significant impact on the content of the management s discussion and analysis as the discussion of the results of the company s marketing communications group businesses 
critical accounting policies the following summary of accounting policies has been prepared to assist in better understanding the company s consolidated financial statements and the related management discussion and analysis 
readers are encouraged to consider this information together with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements as included in the company s annual report on form k for a more complete understanding of accounting policies discussed below 
estimates 
the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including goodwill  intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation  and the reporting of variable interest entities at the date of the financial statements 
the statements are evaluated on an ongoing basis and estimates are based on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results can differ from those estimates  and it is possible that the differences could be material 
revenue recognition 
the company generates services revenue from its marketing communications businesses and product revenue from its secure products businesses 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab  and accordingly  revenue is generally recognized when services are earned or upon delivery of the products when ownership and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
marketing communications group the marketing communications businesses earn revenue from agency arrangements in the form of retainer fees or commissions  from short term project arrangements in the form of fixed fees or per diem fees for services  and from incentives or bonuses 
non refundable retainer fees are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the specific customer contract 
commission revenue is earned and recognized upon the placement of advertisements in various media when the company has no further performance obligations 
fixed fees for services are recognized upon completion of the earnings process and acceptance by the client 
per diem fees are recognized upon the performance of the company s services 
in addition  for certain service transactions the company uses the proportional performance model  which results in delivery being considered to occur over a period of time 
fees billed to clients in excess of fees recognized as revenue are classified as advance billings 
a small portion of the company s contractual arrangements with clients includes performance incentive provisions  which allow the company to earn additional revenues as a result of its performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
the company recognizes the incentive portion of revenue under these arrangements when specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when the company s clients determine performance against qualitative goals has been achieved 
in all circumstances  revenue is only recognized when collection is reasonably assured 
secure products international group substantially all of the secure products international group revenue is derived from the sale of products 
there are no warranty or product return provisions in the company s contracts that result in significant provisions 
the company has the following revenue recognition policies 
revenue derived from the stamp operations is recognized upon shipment or upon delivery of the product to the customer when the company s obligations under the contractual arrangements are completed  the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss of the product  the selling price is determinable and the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company performs quality control testing procedures prior to shipment to ensure that its contractual obligations are met 
under these contractual arrangements  the company has the ability to recover any costs incurred prior to shipment in the event of contract termination accordingly the company accounts for the manufacturing costs incurred as inventory work in process  prior to completion of production 
revenue derived from secured printing arrangements whereby the company manufactures and stores the printed product for a period of time at the direction of its customer with delivery at a future date within a day period is accounted for on a bill and hold basis whereby the company allocates the arrangement consideration on a relative fair value basis between the printing service and the storage service 
the company recognizes the printing revenue when the customized printed products move to the secure storage facility and the printing process are complete and when title transfers to the customer 
the company has no further obligations under the printing segment of the arrangement 
the company recognizes the storage fee revenue on a straight line basis over the period to product delivery 
although amounts are generally not billed by the company until the customized print product is delivered to the customer s premises  collection of the entire consideration is due under certain contracts within days of completion of the printing segment of the arrangement and is not dependent on delivery 
for other contracts where payment is dependent on delivery  revenue is recognized upon delivery to the customer s premises and when other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
revenue derived from the design  manufacturing  inventory management and personalization of secure cards is recognized as a single unit of accounting when the secure card is shipped to the cardholder  the company s service obligations to the card issuer are complete under the terms of the contractual arrangement  the total selling price related to the card is known and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
any amounts billed and or collected in advance of this date are deferred and recognized at the shipping date 
under these contractual arrangements  the company has the ability to recover any costs incurred prior to shipping in the event of contract termination and accordingly the company accounts for the costs incurred related to design and manufacturing as inventory work in process 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition sab 
sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
also  in july  the eitf of the financial accounting standards board released issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
this issue summarized the eitf s views on when revenue should be recorded at the gross amount billed because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services  or the net amount retained because it has earned a fee or commission 
in the marketing communications group businesses  the business at times acts as an agent and records revenue equal to the net amount retained  when the fee or commission is earned 
acquisitions  goodwill and other intangibles 
a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
one approach utilized to determine fair values is a discounted cash flow methodology 
when available and as appropriate  comparative market multiples are used 
numerous estimates and assumptions necessarily have to be made when completing a discounted cash flow valuation  including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates  appropriate discount rates and capital structure 
additionally  estimates must be made regarding revenue growth  operating margins  tax rates  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
estimates and assumptions also need to be made when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used 
actual results of operations  cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 
the company incurred goodwill impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
no impairment charge was recognized in the company has historically made and expects to continue to make selective acquisitions of marketing communications businesses 
in making acquisitions  the price paid is determined by various factors  including service offerings  competitive position  reputation and geographic coverage  as well as prior experience and judgment 
due to the nature of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services companies  the companies acquired frequently have significant identifiable intangible assets  which primarily consist of customer relationships 
the company has determined that certain intangibles trademarks have an indefinite life  as there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  or economic factors that limit the useful life 
a summary of the company s deferred acquisition consideration obligations  sometimes referred to as earnouts  and obligations under put rights of subsidiaries minority shareholders to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the liquidity and capital resources section of this report 
the deferred acquisition consideration obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are primarily based on future performance 
contingent purchase price obligations are accrued  in accordance with gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are stated less allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables usually due to customers potential insolvency 
the allowance included amounts for certain customers where risk of default has been specifically identified 
income tax valuation allowance 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset  tax planning strategies  changes in tax laws and other factors 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company prospectively adopted fair value accounting for stock based awards as prescribed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
prior to january   the company elected not to apply fair value accounting to stock based awards to employees  other than for direct awards of stock and awards settleable in cash  which required fair value accounting 
prior to january   for awards not elected to be accounted for under the fair value method  the company accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
apb is based upon an intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
under this method  compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock issuance at the measurement date over the amount to be paid by the employee 
the company adopted fair value accounting for stock based awards using the prospective method available under the transitional provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
accordingly  the fair value method is applied to all awards granted  modified or settled on or after january  under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and is expensed over the service period  that is the award s vesting period 
when awards are exercised  share capital is credited by the sum of the consideration paid together with the related portion previously credited to additional paid in capital when compensation costs were charged against income or acquisition consideration 
stock based awards that are settled in cash or may be settled in cash at the option of employees are recorded as liabilities 
the measurement of the liability and compensation cost for these awards is based on the intrinsic value of the award  and is recorded into operating income over the service period  that is the vesting period of the award 
changes in the company s payment obligation subsequent to vesting of the award and prior to the settlement date are recorded as compensation cost over the service period in operating income 
the final payment amount for share appreciation rights is established on the date of the exercise of the award by the employee 
variable interest entities 
the company evaluates its various investments in entities to determine whether the investee is a variable interest entity and if so whether mdc is the primary beneficiary 
such evaluation requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk in the investee and the expected losses of the investee and may impact whether the investee is accounted for on a consolidated basis 
new accounting pronouncements the following recent pronouncements were issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb effective in future periods in october  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  which clarifies that rental costs incurred during the period of construction of an asset on leased property should not be capitalized 
rather they should be recognized as rental expense in the same manner as rental costs incurred after the construction period 
fsp fas is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
the capitalization of rental costs must cease as of the effective date in respect of operating lease arrangements entered into prior thereto 
retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements is allowed  but not required 
the company does not expect its financial statements to be significantly impacted by this statement 
in september  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on issue  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty eitf 
the task force addressed the situation in which an entity sells inventory to another entity that operates in the same line of business pursuant to a single arrangement or multiple separate arrangements 
the foregoing consensus is effective for new arrangements entered into and for modifications or renewals of existing arrangements beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period commencing after march   with early application permitted 
the company does not expect its financial statements to be significantly impacted by this statement 
in september  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue  accounting for modifications to conversion options embedded in debt instruments and related issues eitf 
according to eitf issue  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  an exchange of debt instruments having substantially different terms or a substantial modification of the terms of existing debt is deemed tantamount to a debt extinguishment 
in eitf  the task force provides the following additional guidance in the application of eitf in determining whether a substantial modification has been made to a convertible debt instrument and thus whether an extinguishment has occurred  the change in fair value of the related embedded conversion option should be included in the eitf analysis  with such change calculated as the difference between the fair values of the option immediately before and after the modification 
the modification of a convertible debt instrument should affect subsequent recognition of interest expense with respect to changes in the fair value of the embedded conversion option 
a new beneficial conversion feature should not be recognized nor should an existing one be reassessed upon modification to a convertible debt instrument ie  the only value associated with the modification of the embedded conversion option to be accounted for should be the change in its fair value 
the foregoing consensus is effective for future modifications of debt instruments beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period commencing after december   with early application permitted 
in september  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue  income tax consequences of issuing convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature eitf 
the task force reached the following consensuses the issuance of convertible debt with a beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference in applying fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
recognition of such a feature effectively creates a debt instrument and a separate equity instrument for book purposes  whereas the convertible debt is treated entirely as a debt instrument for income tax purposes 
the resulting basis difference should be deemed a temporary difference because it will result in a taxable amount when the recorded amount of the liability is recovered or settled 
recognition of deferred taxes for the temporary difference should be reported as an adjustment to additional paid in capital 
the foregoing consensus is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period commencing after december   with early application permitted 
the effect of applying the consensus should be accounted for retroactively to all debt instruments containing a beneficial conversion feature that are subject to eitf  application of issue no 
to certain convertible debt instruments and thus is applicable to debt instruments converted or extinguished in prior periods but which are still presented in the financial statements 
the company does not expect its financial statements to be significantly impacted by this statement 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in eitf issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially  settled in  a company s own stock 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  specifically provides that contracts issued or held by a reporting entity that are both indexed to its own stock and classified as equity in its balance sheet should not be considered derivative instruments 
eitf issue provides guidance in determining whether an embedded derivative should be classified in stockholders equity if it were a freestanding instrument 
issue contains an exception to its general requirements for evaluating whether  pursuant to sfas no 
 an embedded derivative indexed to a company s own stock would be classified as stockholders equity 
the exception applies to a conventional convertible debt instrument in which the holder may realize the value of the conversion option only by exercising the option and receiving all proceeds in a fixed number of shares or in the equivalent amount of cash at the discretion of the issuer 
the task force reached the following consensuses the exception for conventional convertible debt instruments should be retained in issue instruments providing the holder with an option to convert into a fixed number of shares or an equivalent amount of cash at the issuer s discretion for which the ability to exercise the option feature is based on the passage of time or on a contingent event should be considered conventional for purposes of applying issue convertible preferred stock having a mandatory redemption date may still qualify for the exception if the economic characteristics indicate that the instrument is more like debt than equity 
the foregoing consensuses should be applied to new instruments entered into and instruments modified in periods beginning after june  the company s financial statements were not materially impacted by this statement 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
sfas no 
 accounting for leases  requires that assets recognized under capital leases that do not transfer ownership of the property to the lessee at the end of the lease term  or contain a bargain purchase option  be amortized over a period limited to the lease term which includes reasonably assured renewal periods 
though sfas no 
does not explicitly address the amortization period for leasehold improvements on operating leases  in practice  leasehold improvements placed in service at or near the beginning of the initial lease term are amortized over the lesser of the lease term itself or the useful life of the leasehold improvement 
the eitf reached the following consensuses regarding the amortization period for leasehold improvements on operating leases that are placed in service significantly after the start of the initial lease term such leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the underlying asset  or a term that includes required lease periods and reasonably assured renewal periods 
such other leasehold improvements ie  those not acquired in a business combination placed in service significantly after the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the underlying asset  or a term that includes required lease periods and reasonably assured renewal periods  as of the date on which the leasehold improvements are purchased 
the consensuses should be applied to covered leasehold improvements acquired either in a business combination or otherwise in periods beginning after june   earlier application is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued 
in september  the eitf modified the above consensus to clarify that the guidance in eitf does not apply to pre existing leasehold improvements and should not be used to justify the re evaluation of the amortization periods thereof in respect to additional renewal periods  when new leasehold improvements are placed into service significantly after the initial lease terms and that were not contemplated at or near the inception of the lease term

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to interest rates and foreign currencies 
debt instruments at december   the company s debt obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under a revolving credit facility 
this facility bears interest at variable rates based upon the eurodollar rate  us bank prime rate  us base rate  and canadian bank prime rate  at the company s option 
the company s ability to obtain the required bank syndication commitments depends in part on conditions in the bank market at the time of syndication 
given the existing level of debt of million  as of december   a increase or decrease in the weighted average interest rate  which was at december   would have an interest impact of approximately million annually 
foreign exchange the company conducts business in four currencies  the us dollar  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  and the british pound 
our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our non us operations 
the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and in note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the most part  our revenues and expenses incurred related to those revenues are denominated in the same currency 
this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on profit margins 
the company does not enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
effective june   the company entered into a cross currency swap contract swap  a form of derivative  in order to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations relating to interest payment obligations 
the swap contract provides for a notional amount of debt fixed at c million and at million  with the interest rates fixed at per annum for the canadian dollar amount and fixed at per annum for the us dollar amount 
consequently  under the terms of this swap  semi annually  the company will receive interest of c million and will pay interest of million per annum 
the swap contract matures june
