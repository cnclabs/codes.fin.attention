these professional services include implementation of software solutions  custom software engineering  consulting  maintenance  training and hosting 
in most cases  corillian recognizes revenues for licenses  implementation  training and custom engineering services using the percentage of completion method 
revenues relating to maintenance and hosting services are recognized ratably over the term of the associated maintenance or hosting contract 
revenues derived from consulting services are recognized as the services are performed and revenues from transactional services are recognized as transactions are processed 
corillian generally licenses corillian applications on an end user basis  with its initial license fee based on a fixed number of end users 
as a customer increases its installed base of end users beyond the initial fixed number of end users  corillian s software license requires the customer to pay corillian an additional license fee to cover additional increments of end users 
revenues from additional seat sales are generally recognized in the period in which the licenses are sold 
the market for new sales of internet banking solutions was largely challenging in and due to various factors  including reluctance on the part of some banks to upgrade their internet banking platforms or improve their internet banking websites 
new sales of internet banking solutions improved toward the end of  as corillian ended the year with a revenue backlog of million  the highest in corillian history 
much of the increase in sales to new customers was attributable to increased sales of corillian s new consumer banking application to smaller financial institutions  as well as increased sales of subscription and long term service contracts 
moving forward  corillian will continue to focus on developing additional applications to complement its market position within internet banking and selling products and services to new and existing customers 
on august   corillian completed its acquisition of qbt systems  inc  a leading provider of integration solutions to electronic funds transfer networks and core data processors 
qbt s multipoint product is a powerful integration platform that allows financial institutions to integrate all of their delivery channel and account processing systems in one seamless network environment 
the acquisition was an investment aimed at expanding corillian s product offering and customer base and will allow for a more seamless  real time integration to the many different systems used in the industry today 
these factors  among others  support the 
table of contents premium paid over the fair market value of individual assets 
the total purchase price including merger related transaction costs was million 
the cost of the acquisition was allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities assumed 
the purchase accounting allocations resulted in  net liabilities assumed  goodwill of million and intangibles of million 
intangibles are being amortized to cost of revenues and sales and marketing over their estimated lives of to years 
at the acquisition date  qbt did not have any in process research and development as qbt was in between major product development cycles 
accordingly  corillian did not recognize any expense for in process research and development in its results of operations for the year ended december  on august   corillian completed its acquisition of intelidata technologies corporation  a leading provider of electronic bill payment and presentment and online banking solutions to the financial services industry 
intelidata s products provide financial institutions with the real time financial processing infrastructure needed to provide its customers with payment and presentment services and online banking via the internet and other delivery channels 
intelidata s customers included banks  credit unions  brokerage firms  financial institution processors and credit card issuers 
the acquisition was an investment aimed at expanding corillian s product offering  customer base and revenue growth 
these factors  among others  support the premium paid over the fair market value of individual assets 
the total purchase price including merger related transaction costs was million 
the cost of the acquisition was allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities assumed 
the purchase accounting allocations resulted in net liabilities assumed of million  goodwill of million and intangibles of million 
intangibles are being amortized to cost of revenues and sales and marketing over their estimated lives of to years 
at the acquisition date  intelidata did not have any in process research and development as intelidata was in between major product development cycles 
accordingly  corillian did not recognize any expense for in process research and development in its results of operations for year ended december  since incorporation  corillian has incurred substantial costs to develop and market its technology and to provide professional services 
as a result  corillian has an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  corillian has had three consecutive fiscal years  through  of profitability 
however  corillian did incur minor losses in the third and fourth quarters of and its operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
as a result of the rapid evolution of corillian s business and limited operating history  corillian believes period to period comparisons of its results of operations  including its revenues and cost of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are not necessarily indicative of its future performance 
in addition  the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no 
r  which corillian will adopt in the first quarter of and requires companies to recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the fair value method  will have a material negative impact on corillian s consolidated statements of operations and could result in future operating losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
on december   corillian s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of those employee stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than 
the closing price of corillian s common stock as quoted on december  was per share 
the acceleration applied to all options outstanding as of december  under corillian s stock incentive compensation plan and nonqualified stock incentive compensation plan 
options to purchase  shares of corillian s common stock  or approximately of corillian s total outstanding options  with a weighted average exercise price of and varying remaining vesting schedules  became immediately vested and exercisable on december  of these  options   options are held by one corillian executive officer 
no options held by corillian s directors were impacted by the acceleration of vesting 
because the affected options had exercise prices significantly in excess of the current price per share of corillian s common stock  the options have little or no incentive value 
the vesting of these options was accelerated to avoid the recognition of expense with respect to these options under statement no 
r  which corillian has adopted effective january  included in the pro forma stock based compensation expense for in note is million associated 
table of contents with the acceleration 
as a result of this acceleration  corillian estimates a reduction in stock based compensation expense associated with this acceleration of approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon corillian s audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires corillian to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
corillian bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates related to software revenue recognition  accrual for contracts in a loss position  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets  which include goodwill and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of corillian s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation  accruals for contracts in loss positions  goodwill and intangibles 
corillian s policy and related procedures for software revenue recognition are summarized below 
revenue recognition 
corillian recognizes revenues from software licensing agreements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
corillian s software arrangements generally include software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services  post contractual customer support  training services and may also include hosting services 
corillian s software licenses are  in general  functionally dependent on implementation  training and certain custom software engineering services  therefore  software licenses and implementation and training services  together with custom software engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software  are combined and recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
corillian has determined that post contractual customer support and hosting services can be separated from software licenses  implementation  training and custom software engineering services because a post contractual customer support and hosting services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement  and b sufficient vendor specific objective evidence exists to permit the allocation of revenue to these service elements 
the hosting element can be accounted for separately from the license element  as the customer can take possession of the software without significant penalty  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of contract hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract hours for each contract 
corillian has the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates relating to the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
profit estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses towards completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period that the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
corillian reduces the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through various approval and monitoring processes and policies 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative billings at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as deferred revenue or revenue in excess of billings  respectively 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 

table of contents vendor specific objective evidence has been established on post contractual customer support and hosting services using the renewal rate 
corillian allocates revenue to certain elements in multiple element arrangements using the residual method 
the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for post contractual customer support and hosting services is allocated to software license  implementation  training and custom software engineering services and recognized using contract accounting 
revenues for post contractual customer support are recognized ratably over the term of the support services period  generally a period of one year 
services provided to customers under customer support and maintenance agreements generally include technical support and unspecified product upgrades deliverable on a when and if available basis 
revenues from hosting services for transactions processed by corillian are recognized ratably over the hosting term 
pursuant to sop no 
 on projects where reasonable estimates cannot be made due to inherent hazards  but where there is an assurance no loss will be incurred  corillian limits revenue recognition in the period to the amount of project costs incurred in the same period  and postpones recognition of profits until results can be estimated more precisely 
under this zero profit methodology  equal amounts of revenues and costs  measured on the basis of performance during the period  are presented in corillian s consolidated statements of operations 
corillian generally licenses corillian voyager on an end user basis  with its initial license fee based on a fixed number of end users 
as a customer increases its installed base of end users beyond the initial fixed number of end users  corillian s software license agreements require customers to pay corillian an additional license fee to cover additional increments of end users 
revenues from additional license seat sales  less any amounts related to maintenance included in the arrangement  are generally recognized in the period in which the licenses are sold 
in arrangements where corillian does not have an obligation to install its products  but may become involved in the installation of these products  corillian recognizes non refundable license fees over the estimated implementation period for the customer or reseller s project 
if corillian determines that the customer or reseller can successfully install corillian s products in a production environment without corillian s involvement  corillian will recognize non refundable license fees in the period in which delivery occurs  assuming all other sop no 
revenue recognition criteria are met 
in certain arrangements  corillian may defer all revenues and related costs of revenues until delivery is complete and customer acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements have certain elements of risk such as an obligation to deliver new products when technological feasibility has not been obtained at the onset of the arrangement or an obligation to deliver software customized to a customer specifications 
in arrangements where corillian is providing customized functionality on a best efforts basis  corillian generally recognizes revenues as services are performed 
revenue from transactional services are recognized as transactions are processed 
where corillian s customers enter into arrangements to purchase corillian s software and services on a subscription basis  corillian recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under these arrangements  corillian defers recognition of the implementation and license revenue and recognizes them ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship 
costs associated with implementation are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the arrangements 
income taxes 
corillian has established a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  including those for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
such a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors  including corillian s history of having net losses  losses in the third and fourth quarter of  future projections and limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance at december  and were million and million  respectively 
corillian will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in future reporting periods

as permitted by existing accounting standards  corillian elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above  and adopted only the disclosure requirements of statement no 
 as amended 
expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual stock option awards consistent with the method prescribed in fin no 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
corillian performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and identified no impairment 
to determine whether or not goodwill is impaired  a test is performed comparing the book value of the reporting unit to its trading price 
statement no 
requires purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  unless an asset has an indefinite life 
purchased intangible assets with definite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization expense is recognized over the estimated useful lives  which range from one to six years 
corillian estimates amortization of intangibles to be million in recent accounting pronouncements 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which replaces statement no 
 supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flow 
currently  corillian uses the black scholes model for option expense calculation and presents pro forma disclosure of the statements of operations effect in financial statement footnotes only under apb no 
however  under statement no 
r  pro forma disclosure of the statements of operations effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative and all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  will be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
statement no 
r is effective for public companies with annual periods that begin after june  corillian believes that the adoption of statement no 
r will have a material impact on its results of operations  however  corillian is not able to determine the full effect of the adoption as it is dependant upon future grant activity  corillian s stock price  and other variables 
in march  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no

r and sab no 
will reduce diluted net income per share by approximately to per share for fiscal in addition  corillian s existing line of credit requires corillian to maintain 
table of contents certain levels of net income 
the impact of fasb statement no
