item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview beginning on page  to seek third party development contracts  which benefits us when our internal development is less active or when new development is less warranted due to market conditions  which can be a significant source of revenue and enables us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff  and to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital 

table of contents growth strategies external growth we believe that our development experience and our organizational depth position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types  including single story suburban office properties  high rise urban developments  mixed use developments and research and laboratory space  within budget and on schedule 
other factors that contribute to our competitive position include our control of sites including sites under contract or option to acquire in our markets that will support approximately million square feet of new office  hotel and residential development  our reputation gained through years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties  our relationships with leading national corporations and public institutions seeking new facilities and development services  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry  our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provides comfort to domestic and foreign institutions  private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas  our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing  and our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high quality real estate assets 
opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories development in selected submarkets 
as market conditions continue to improve  we believe that development of well positioned office buildings will be justified in many of our submarkets 
we believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time 
while we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers to entry  we have demonstrated throughout our year history  an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms 
we believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential 
in the past  we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development 
because of our development expertise  knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies  we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value 
we seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment 
our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build to suit opportunities 
we intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles 
acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals 
we believe that due to our size  management strength and reputation  we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria 
we may acquire properties for cash  but we are also particularly well positioned to appeal to sellers wishing to convert on a tax deferred basis their ownership of property into equity in a diversified real estate operating 
table of contents company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution 
our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in bplp to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or our common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a tax efficient basis 
in addition  we may consider mergers with and acquisitions of compatible real estate firms 
acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets 
we believe that because of our in depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets  our national reputation with brokers  financial institutions and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively priced capital  we are well positioned to identify and acquire existing  underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies and a responsive property management program 
we have developed this strategy and program for our existing portfolio  where we provide high quality property management services using our own employees in order to encourage tenants to renew  expand and relocate in our properties 
we are able to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in house and third party vendors services for marketing  including calls and presentations to prospective tenants  print advertisements  lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements 
our tenants benefit from cost efficiencies produced by our experienced work force  which is attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management 
internal growth we believe that significant opportunities will exist in the long term to increase cash flow from our existing properties because they are of high quality and in desirable locations 
in addition  our properties are in markets where  in general  the creation of new supply is limited by the lack of available sites  the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development on vacant land and the difficulty of obtaining financing 
our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is two fold to provide high quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew  expand and relocate in our properties  and to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in house services for marketing  lease negotiation and construction of tenant improvements 
we believe that with the continued improvement of the economy  our office properties will add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations 
in addition  we believe that with the continued improvement in the business and leisure travel sector  our two hotel properties will continue to add to our internal growth because of their desirable locations in the downtown boston and east cambridge submarkets 
we expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to cultivate existing submarkets and long term relationships with credit tenants 
in choosing locations for our properties  we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns  physical environment  adjacency to established business centers  proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors 
we had an average lease term of years at december  and continue to cultivate long term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high quality  financially stable tenants 
based on leases in place at december   leases with respect to of the total square feet from our class a office properties will expire in calendar year directly manage properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention 
we provide property management services ourselves  rather than contracting for this service  to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs 
we and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations 
replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs 
we believe that we are well positioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental rates as a 
table of contents result of our well located  well designed and well maintained properties  our reputation for high quality building services and responsiveness to tenants  and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets 
extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration 
we have also successfully structured early tenant renewals  which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit worthy tenants on a long term basis and enhancing relationships 
policies with respect to certain activities the discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment  financing and other policies 
these policies have been determined by our board of directors and  in general  may be amended or revised from time to time by our board of directors 
investment policies investments in real estate or interests in real estate our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our securityholders and to achieve long term capital appreciation through increases in the value of boston properties  inc we have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives 
we expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties  development projects and other acquired properties 
we currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment  and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential  primarily in our markets boston  washington  dc  midtown manhattan  san francisco and princeton  dc future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets 
we intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
in addition  we may purchase or lease income producing commercial and other types of properties for long term investment  expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased  or sell such real estate properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
we do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property  however  our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants 
we may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
these investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and  therefore  add flexibility in structuring our portfolio 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments 
debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to our common stock 
investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
investments in real estate mortgages while our current portfolio consists of  and our business objectives emphasize  equity investments in commercial real estate  we may  at the discretion of the board of directors  invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a reit 
investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup its full investment 
we do not presently intend to invest in 
table of contents mortgages or deeds of trust  but may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in value of the property 
securities of or interests in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for our reit qualification  we also may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 
dispositions our disposition of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the board of directors that such action would be in our best interests 
any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the board of directors or a committee thereof 
some holders of limited partnership interests in bplp  including messrs 
mortimer b 
zuckerman  edward h 
linde and other executive officers  would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to us 
consequently  holders of limited partnership interests in bplp may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale 
such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain 
generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction 
unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like kind exchange or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue  recognition of the deferred tax gain allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by the sale 
certain assets are subject to tax protection agreements  which may limit our ability to dispose of the assets or require us to pay damages to the prior owners in the event of a taxable sale 
financing policies the agreement of limited partnership of bplp and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
however  our mortgages  credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness 
we have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole 
our board of directors will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness  including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing  the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and bplp as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
policies with respect to other activities as the sole general partner of bplp  we have the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of bplp 
we have in the past  and may in the future  issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest of bplp to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units of limited partnership interest in bplp 
we have not engaged in trading  underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than bplp and we do not intend to do so 
at all times  we intend to make investments in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a reit  unless because of circumstances or changes in the internal revenue code of  as amended or the treasury regulations  our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 
we may make loans to third parties  including  without limitation  to joint ventures in which we participate 
we intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment 
table of contents company under the act 
our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the board of directors 
competition we compete in the leasing of office space with a considerable number of other real estate companies  some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us 
in addition  our hotel properties compete for guests with other hotels  some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our hotels  marriott international  inc principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning  acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties  leasing terms including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements  attractiveness and convenience of location  the quality and breadth of tenant services provided  and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market 
additionally  our ability to compete depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national and local economies  investment alternatives  financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  utilities  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
the hotel properties on november   we sold our residence inn by marriott at six cambridge center  leaving us with two hotel properties 
we operate our two hotel properties through a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
the trs  a wholly owned subsidiary of bplp  is the lessee pursuant to leases for each of the hotel properties 
as lessor  bplp is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel properties 
the hotel leases allow all the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us 
marriott international  inc continues to manage the hotel properties under the marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements 
marriott has been engaged under separate long term incentive management agreements to operate and manage each of the hotels on behalf of the trs 
in connection with these arrangements  marriott has agreed to operate and maintain the hotels in accordance with its system wide standard for comparable hotels and to provide the hotels with the benefits of its central reservation system and other chain wide programs and services 
under a separate management agreement for each hotel  marriott acts as the trs agent to supervise  direct and control the management and operation of the hotel and receives as compensation base management fees that are calculated as a percentage of the hotel s gross revenues  and supplemental incentive fees if the hotel exceeds negotiated profitability breakpoints 
in addition  the trs compensates marriott  on the basis of a formula applied to the hotel s gross revenues  for certain system wide services provided by marriott  including central reservations  marketing and training 
during  and  marriott received an aggregate of approximately million  million and million  respectively  under the management agreements

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors 
we refer to the shares of our common stock and the units of limited partnership interest in bplp together as our securities  and the investors who own shares or units  or both  as our securityholders 
this section contains forward looking statements 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements beginning on page our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets  and consequently the value of our securities  are subject to the risk that if our office and hotel properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected 
the following factors  among others  may adversely affect the income generated by our office and hotel properties downturns in the national  regional and local economic conditions particularly increases in unemployment  competition from other office  hotel and commercial buildings  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office  hotel or other commercial space  changes in interest rates and availability of attractive financing  vacancies  changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair  renovate and re let space  increased operating costs  including insurance expense  utilities  real estate taxes  state and local taxes and heightened security costs  civil disturbances  earthquakes and other natural disasters  or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses  significant expenditures associated with each investment  such as debt service payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property  declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants  and decreases in the underlying value of our real estate 
we are dependent upon the economic climates of our markets boston  washington  dc  midtown manhattan  san francisco and princeton  dc our revenue is derived from properties located in five markets boston  washington  dc  midtown manhattan  san francisco and princeton  dc a downturn in the economies of these markets  or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies  could result in reduced demand for office space 
because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio  a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations 
additionally  there are submarkets within our core markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries 
for example  in our washington  dc market we are primarily dependent on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors  as well as legal firms 
in our midtown manhattan market we have historically leased properties to financial  legal and other professional firms 
a significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents our investment in property development may be more costly than anticipated 
we intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office properties 
our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all  we may incur construction costs for a development project which exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials  labor  leasing or other costs  which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs  we may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  required zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project  we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred  we may expend funds on and devote management s time to projects which we do not complete  and we may be unable to complete construction and or leasing of a property on schedule 
investment returns from our developed properties may be lower than anticipated 
our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development  and occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all 
our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments 
in appropriate circumstances  we intend to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures 
we currently have seven joint ventures that are not consolidated with our financial statements 
our share of the aggregate revenue of these joint ventures represented approximately of our total revenue the sum of our total consolidated revenue and our share of such joint venture revenue for the year ended december  our participation in joint ventures is subject to the risks that we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop or operate a property  our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties  and our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues 
in addition  our ability to enter into other joint ventures with third parties to pursue the acquisition of value added investments similar to those being pursued by the value added fund is limited by the terms of the value added fund s partnership agreement 

table of contents we face risks associated with property acquisitions 
we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties  including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure 
our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property  we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition related costs  we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected  the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be greater than our estimates  the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control  which may not be satisfied  acquired properties may be located in new markets where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy  lack of business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures  and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into our existing operations  and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp 
this acquisition structure has the effect  among others  of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties  and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases 
these restrictions on dispositions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time  or on terms  that would be favorable absent such restrictions 
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse against the prior owners or other third parties  with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 
we plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities 
we may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors  particularly private investors who can incur more leverage  and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well capitalized real estate investors  including publicly traded and private reits  institutional investment funds and other real estate investors  and 
table of contents even if we are able to acquire a desired property  competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price 
we face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re leasing space 
we derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants 
if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress  it may be unable to make timely rental payments 
also  when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early  we may not be able to re let the space 
even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space  the terms of renewals or new leases  including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants  may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
as a result  our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected 
we face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties 
our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future 
we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy 
on the other hand  a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us 
in such case  our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease  and  even so  our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full 
this shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 
we may have difficulty selling our properties  which may limit our flexibility 
large and high quality office and hotel properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell 
this may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders 
these restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes 
properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp often have low tax bases 
if we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions  we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the internal revenue code for reits  which in turn would impact our cash flow 
in some cases  without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors 
to dispose of low basis or tax protected properties efficiently we often use like kind exchanges  which qualify for non recognition of taxable gain  but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes including tax protection covenants 
our properties face significant competition 
we face significant competition from developers  owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate  including sublease space available from our tenants 
substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market 
this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge 
these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties  which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties 

table of contents because we own two hotel properties  we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry 
because the lease payments we receive under the hotel leases are based on a participation in the gross receipts of the hotels  if the hotels do not generate sufficient receipts  our cash flow would be decreased  which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders 
the following factors  among others  are common to the hotel industry  and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel properties our hotel properties compete for guests with other hotels  a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel operating business partners  if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors  our hotel operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates  our hotel properties are subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism  and our hotel properties are subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general  including war and terrorism 
in addition  because our hotel properties are located within two miles of each other in downtown boston and cambridge  they are subject to the boston market s fluctuations in demand  increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply 
because of the ownership structure of our two hotel properties  we face potential adverse effects from changes to the applicable tax laws 
we own two hotel properties 
however  under the internal revenue code  reits like us are not allowed to operate hotels directly or indirectly 
accordingly  we lease our hotel properties to one of our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trs 
as lessor  we are entitled to a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the hotel properties 
marriott international  inc manages the hotels under the marriott name pursuant to a management contract with the trs as lessee 
while the trs structure allows the economic benefits of ownership to flow to us  the trs is subject to tax on its income from the operations of the hotels at the federal and state level 
in addition  the trs is subject to detailed tax regulations that affect how it may be capitalized and operated 
if the tax laws applicable to trss are modified  we may be forced to modify the structure for owning our hotel properties  and such changes may adversely affect the cash flows from our hotels 
in addition  the internal revenue service  the united states treasury department and congress frequently review federal income tax legislation  and we cannot predict whether  when or to what extent new federal tax laws  regulations  interpretations or rulings will be adopted 
any of such actions may prospectively or retroactively modify the tax treatment of the trs and  therefore  may adversely affect our after tax returns from our hotel properties 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings  including office buildings and hotels  be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants 
if  under the americans with disabilities act  we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties  including the removal of access barriers  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders 
our properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could incur fines or private damage awards 
we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations 

table of contents some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry insurance coverage on our properties of types and in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties 
in response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of september   the federal terrorism risk insurance act  or tria  was enacted in november to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined by the statute through december   which date was extended to december  by the united states department of treasury on june  and which date was further extended to december  by the terrorism risk insurance extension act of the tria extension act 
tria expires on december   and we cannot currently anticipate whether it will be extended 
effective as of march   our property insurance program per occurrence limits were decreased from billion to million  including coverage for both certified and non certified acts of terrorism by tria 
the amount of such insurance available in the market has decreased because of the natural disasters which occurred during we also carry nuclear  biological and chemical terrorism insurance coverage nbc coverage for certified acts of terrorism as defined by tria  which is provided by ixp  inc as a direct insurer 
effective as of march   we extended the nbc coverage to march   excluding our value added fund properties 
effective as of march   the per occurrence limit for nbc coverage was decreased from billion to million 
under tria  after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance the nbc coverage is backstopped by the federal government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger 
under the tria extension act a the program trigger is million through march   million from april  through december  and million from january  through december  and b the coinsurance is through december  and through december  we may elect to terminate the nbc coverage when the program trigger increases on january   if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason 
we intend to continue to monitor the scope  nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable 
we also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self insurance that we believe are commercially reasonable 
in addition  this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property 
specifically  we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our san francisco portfolio with a million per occurrence limit and a million aggregate limit  million of which is provided by ixp  inc  as a direct insurer 
the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes 
as a result of increased costs of coverage and limited availability  the amount of third party earthquake insurance that we may be able to purchase on commercially reasonable terms may be reduced 
in addition  we may discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage 
in january  we formed a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  ixp  inc  or ixp  to act as a captive insurance company and be one of the elements of our overall insurance program 
ixp acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our greater san francisco properties and our nbc coverage for certified acts of terrorism under tria 
insofar as we own ixp  we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources  and the accounts of ixp are part of our consolidated financial statements 
in particular  if a loss occurs which is covered by our nbc coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under tria  ixp would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the federal government 
if we experience a loss and ixp is required to pay under our insurance policy  we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of ixp s required payment 
therefore  insurance coverage provided by ixp should not be considered as the equivalent of third party insurance  but rather as a modified form of self insurance 
we continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general  and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism in particular  but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years 
there are other types of losses  such as from wars or the presence of mold at our properties  for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost 
with respect to such 
table of contents losses and losses from acts of terrorism  earthquakes or other catastrophic events  if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties  as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties 
depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property  it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations 
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties 
we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks  including midtown manhattan  washington  dc  boston and san francisco 
as a result  some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity 
this could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular  which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both 
in addition  future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties  both physically and financially  or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage 
as a result of the foregoing  our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially 
see also some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate 
if unidentified environmental problems arise  we may have to make substantial payments  which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders  because as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination  the law typically imposes clean up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination  each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs  and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs 
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property 
we currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable 
specifically  we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of million 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
in addition  applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties  or increasing the restrictions on the handling  storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  
table of contents notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos  and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination 
it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties 
these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas  an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state  federal and historical documents  but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling 
where appropriate  on a property by property basis  our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing  including sampling for asbestos  for lead in drinking water  for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem  and for contamination in groundwater 
even though these environmental assessments are conducted  there is still the risk that the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted  and future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us 
inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and  depending on the results  remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs 
indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources  and biological contaminants such as molds  pollen  viruses and bacteria 
indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals 
if these conditions were to occur at one of our properties  we may need to undertake a targeted remediation program  including without limitation  steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants 
such remediation programs could be costly  necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property s tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property 
we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments  including refinancing risk 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
we anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources  such as new equity capital  our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due 
we have agreements with a number of limited partners of bplp who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require bplp to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our 
table of contents assets and or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property 
these tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt 
an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  and we may incur more of such indebtedness in the future 
accordingly  if interest rates increase  so will our interest costs  which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders 
further  rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to a portion of our variable rate debt  and we may in the future enter into similar agreements  including swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate hedging contracts 
while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us  they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform  the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets  thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition 
the mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage 
our unsecured credit facility  unsecured debt securities and secured construction loans contain customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness  including total debt to asset ratios  secured debt to total asset ratios  debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt  which we must maintain 
our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants 
in addition  our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement  and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources 
under those circumstances  other sources of capital may not be available to us  or be available only on unattractive terms 
additionally  in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms  particularly if tria is not extended beyond december  we rely on debt financing  including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties  to finance our acquisition and development activities and for working capital 
if we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources  or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity  our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected 
if we breach covenants in our debt agreements  the lenders can declare a default and  if the debt is secured  can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan 
in addition  our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness  giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances 
defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our common stock or debt securities 
on march   we had approximately billion in total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis ie  excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt 
debt to market capitalization ratio  which measures total 
table of contents debt as a percentage of the aggregate of total debt plus the market value of outstanding equity securities  is often used by analysts to gauge leverage for equity reits such as us 
our market value is calculated using the price per share of our common stock 
using the closing stock price of per share of our common stock of boston properties  inc on march   multiplied by the sum of the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of bplp including common partnership units held by us  the number of common partnership units available upon conversion of all outstanding preferred partnership units of bplp and the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units assuming all conditions have been met for conversion of the ltip units  our debt to market capitalization ratio was approximately as of march  our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes 
our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies 
however  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain this rating  and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating  we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and or difficulty in obtaining additional financing 
our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 
there is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio  which is in part a function of our stock price  or our ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders 
the interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments  acquisitions  or repay indebtedness 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would cause us to be taxed as a corporation  which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends 
if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit  for federal income tax purposes  we will be taxed as a corporation 
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit and intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit 
however  we cannot assure you that we are qualified as such  or that we will remain qualified as such in the future 
this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control 
future legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
in addition  we currently hold certain of our properties  and the value added fund holds its properties  through a subsidiary that has elected to be taxed as a reit and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits 
if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  then we may also fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
if we fail to qualify as a reit we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  
table of contents unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions  we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified  and all dividends will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will no longer be required to pay dividends 
as a result of all these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and it would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in order to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions 
in order to maintain our reit status  we may need to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements  even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 
to qualify as reit  we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least of our net taxable income each year  excluding capital gains 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
we may need short term debt or long term debt or proceeds from asset sales  creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes  or the effect of non deductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments 
the inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short and long term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain our reit status 
limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of bplp  as well as provisions of the internal revenue code and delaware corporate law  may delay or prevent a change of control over us or a tender offer  even if such action might be beneficial to our stockholders  and limit our stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices 
stock ownership limit to facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a reit and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of capital stock ownership  our certificate of incorporation generally prohibits ownership  directly  indirectly or beneficially  by any single stockholder of more than of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity stock 
we refer to this limitation as the ownership limit 
our board of directors may waive or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
in addition  under our certificate of incorporation each of mortimer b 
zuckerman and edward h 
linde  along with their respective families and affiliates  as well as  in general  pension plans and mutual funds  may actually and beneficially own up to of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our equity common stock 
shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties 
the ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control 
bplp s partnership agreement we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions  including  among others  business combinations  unless limited partners of bplp other than boston 
table of contents properties  inc receive  or have the opportunity to receive  either the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of our common stock in the transaction or limited partnership units that  among other things  would entitle the holders  upon redemption of these units  to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of our common stock received in the transaction 
if these limited partners would not receive such consideration  we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least of the common units of limited partnership interest  other than those held by boston properties  inc or its affiliates  consent to the transaction 
in addition  we have agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp that we will not complete specified extraordinary transactions  including among others  business combinations  in which we receive the approval of our common stockholders unless limited partners holding at least of the common units of limited partnership interest  other than those held by boston properties  inc or its affiliates  consent to the transaction or the limited partners of bplp are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction 
therefore  if our common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction  the partnership agreement requires the following before we can complete the transaction holders of partnership interests in bplp  including boston properties  inc  must vote on the matter  boston properties  inc must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as our stockholders voted on the transaction  and the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in bplp must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders  the business combination would have been approved 
as a result of these provisions  a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal  and we may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction  including a proposed business combination  even though our stockholders approve of the transaction 
shareholder rights plan we have a shareholder rights plan 
under the terms of this plan  we can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock because  unless we approve of the acquisition  after the person acquires more than of our outstanding common stock  all other stockholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price that is less than their then fair market value 
this would substantially reduce the value and influence of the stock owned by the acquiring person 
our board of directors can prevent the plan from operating by approving the transaction in advance  which gives us significant power to approve or disapprove of the efforts of a person or group to acquire a large interest in our company 
we may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders 
our operating and financial policies  including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate  growth  operations  indebtedness  capitalization and dividends  are exclusively determined by our board of directors 
accordingly  our stockholders do not control these policies 
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we depend on the efforts of key personnel  particularly mortimer b 
zuckerman  chairman of our board of directors  and edward h 
linde  our president and chief executive officer 
among the reasons that messrs 
zuckerman and linde are important to our success is that each has a national reputation  which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders 
if we lost their services  our relationships with lenders  potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish 
mr 
zuckerman has substantial outside business interests that could interfere with his ability to devote his full time to our business and affairs 
our three executive vice presidents and other executive officers that serve as managers of our regional offices also have strong reputations 
their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities  having opportunities 
table of contents brought to us  and negotiating with tenants and build to suit prospects 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders  prospective tenants and industry personnel 
conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in bplp 
sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in bplp than on our stockholders 
some holders of interests in bplp  including messrs 
zuckerman and linde  would incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to us and our stockholders 
consequently  these holders of partnership interests in bplp may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt 
while we have exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of bplp to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether  when  and on what terms to sell a property  subject  in the case of certain properties  to the contractual commitments described below  any such decision would require the approval of our board of directors 
while the board of directors has a policy with respect to these matters  as directors and executive officers  messrs 
zuckerman and linde could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some  or a majority  of our stockholders  including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness 
agreement not to sell some properties 
under the terms of the limited partnership agreement of bplp  we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer some of our properties  prior to specified dates  in any transaction that would trigger taxable income  without first obtaining the consent of messrs 
zuckerman and linde 
however  we are not required to obtain their consent if  during the applicable period  each of them does not hold at least of his original interests in bplp  or if those properties are transferred in a nontaxable transaction 
in addition  we have entered into similar agreements with respect to other properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in bplp 
pursuant to those agreements  we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale 
in general  our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered 
as of december   there were a total of wholly owned properties subject to these restrictions  and those properties are estimated to have accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  bplp has also entered into agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and  in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced  additional and or substitute indebtedness 
these agreements may hinder actions that we may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because we would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if we violate these agreements 
messrs 
zuckerman and linde will continue to engage in other activities 
messrs 
zuckerman and linde have a broad and varied range of investment interests 
either one could acquire an interest in a company which is not currently involved in real estate investment activities but which may acquire real property in the future 
however  pursuant to each of their employment agreements  messrs 
zuckerman and linde will not  in general  have management control over such companies and  therefore  they may not be able to prevent one or more of such companies from engaging in activities that are in competition with our activities 

table of contents changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as with other publicly traded equity securities  the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following the extent of investor interest in our securities  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  our underlying asset value  investor confidence in the stock and bond markets  generally  national economic conditions  changes in tax laws  our financial performance  change in our credit rating  and general stock and bond market conditions 
the market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends 
consequently  our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock 
if our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish 
the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
in connection with and subsequent to our initial public offering  we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of capital stock of boston properties  inc or partnership interests in bplp were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors 
this common stock  or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in bplp  may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors 
additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans  including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities  may also be sold in the market at some time in the future 
future sales of our common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of our common stock 
we did not obtain new owner s title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during our initial public offering 
we acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of our initial public offering in june before we acquired these properties  each of them was insured by a title insurance policy 
we did not obtain new owner s title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties 
however  to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the ipo  we have obtained new title insurance policies 
nevertheless  because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries  some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us 
many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties 
if there was a title defect related to any of these properties  or to any of the properties acquired at the time of our initial public offering  that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy  we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property 
we have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after our initial public offering  however  these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties 

table of contents we face possible adverse changes in tax laws 
from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted  which may result in an increase in our tax liability 
a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes 
if such changes occur  we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income 
these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for payment of dividends 
we face possible state and local tax audits 
because we are organized and qualify as a reit  we are generally not subject to federal income taxes  but are subject to certain state and local taxes 
in the normal course of business  certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone  or are currently undergoing  tax audits 
although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits  in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue 
collectively  tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material 
however  there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

item properties at december   our portfolio consisted of properties totaling million net rentable square feet 
our properties consisted of office properties  comprised of class a office buildings  including properties under construction and properties that support both office and technical uses  two retail properties and two hotels 
in addition  we own or control acres of land for future development 
the table set forth below shows information relating to the properties we owned  or in which we had an ownership interest  at december  information relating to properties owned by the value added fund is not included in our portfolio information tables or any other portfolio level statistics because the value added fund invests in assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning  refurbishment or renovation 
we therefore believe including such information in our portfolio tables and statistics would render the portfolio information less useful to investors

ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently 
amount represents our share  which was    and for the years ended december     and  respectively  after allocation to the minority interest in the operating partnership 
in addition to presenting ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  for the years ended december    and we also disclose ffo  as adjusted  which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate  adjustments for non qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments 
the adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt s stated maturity and to write off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment 
such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with gaap 
however  we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions 
we believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions 

table of contents the adjustments for net derivative losses related to non qualifying derivative contracts for the years ended december   and resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of sfas no 
to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development 
upon transition to sfas no 
on january   the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings  while prior to that time they were capitalized 
although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program  the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments from the first quarter of through the third quarter of management presents ffo before the impact of non qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under gaap did not correspond to a substantive difference 
management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment 
the adjustments for early lease surrender for the years ended december  and resulted from a unique lease transaction related to the surrender of space by a tenant that was accounted for as a termination for gaap purposes and recorded in income at the time the space was surrendered 
however  we continued to collect payments monthly after the surrender of space through the month of july  the date on which the terminated lease would otherwise have expired under its original terms 
management presents ffo after the early surrender lease adjustment because economically this transaction impacted periods subsequent to the time the space was surrendered by the tenant and  therefore  recording the entire amount of the lease termination payment in a single period made ffo less useful as an indicator of operating performance 
although these adjustments are attributable to a single lease  the transaction impacted multiple reporting periods and resulted in adjustments for the years ended december  and although our ffo  as adjusted  clearly differs from nareit s definition of ffo  and may not be comparable to that of other reits and real estate companies  we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that  by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate  adjustments for non qualifying derivative contracts and early lease surrender payments  management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting ffo 
neither ffo  nor ffo as adjusted  should be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our performance 
neither ffo nor ffo  as adjusted  represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 
we believe that to further understand our performance  ffo and ffo  as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
a reconciliation of ffo  and ffo  as adjusted  to net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap is provided under the heading of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  principally  but not only  under the captions business business and growth strategies  risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report  or which management may make orally or in 
table of contents writing from time to time  are based on management s beliefs and on assumptions made by  and information currently available to  management

these statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance  which may be affected by known and unknown risks  trends  uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may differ materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
we caution you that  while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them  they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements 
we expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
accordingly  investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements  which are based on results and trends at the time they are made  to anticipate future results or trends 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include  among others  the following general risks affecting the real estate industry including  without limitation  the inability to enter into or renew leases  dependence on tenants financial condition  and competition from other developers  owners and operators of real estate  risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and or availability of financing  risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements  failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully  risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction including  without limitation  construction delays  cost overruns  inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities  risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies  increases in interest rates  and volatility in the securities markets  risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks  risks associated with the impact on our insurance program if tria  which expires on december   is not extended or is extended on different terms  costs of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws  potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination  risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws  risks associated with possible state and local tax audits  and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report  including part i  item a risk factors  include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual 
table of contents results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on form q for future periods and current reports on form k as we file them with the sec  and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on form k or otherwise 
overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in five markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc  san francisco and princeton  dc we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  the costs of tenant improvements  operating costs and real estate taxes  our current and anticipated vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors 
we also generate cash through the sale of assets  which may be either non core assets that have limited growth potential or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors 
we continue to believe our corporate strategy of owning and developing high quality office buildings concentrated in strong  supply constrained markets and emphasizing long term leases to creditworthy tenants has allowed us to perform well relative to our peers in difficult markets and even better in favorable markets 
in addition  we believe our financial strategy of matching long term fixed rate debt with our long term leases helps to insulate us from rising interest costs and  accordingly  we have fixed the interest rate on approximately of our outstanding debt 
the office markets in which we operate showed dramatic improvement in in particular  our portfolio experienced strong rental rate growth over the past twelve month period in our midtown manhattan  san francisco and washington  dc markets and our suburban boston submarkets 
we expect this trend to continue  but its impact on our rental revenues will be felt gradually given the modest magnitude of lease expirations  some of which reflect the high rents achieved in the late s 
in boston and san francisco  which make up approximately of our office rollover in  we believe the average expiring rent is between and greater than the current market rents 
during  we completed the sale of million of assets while retaining property management on several of the significant properties sold  paid a special dividend of per common share in october and increased our regular quarterly dividend for the eighth consecutive year 
including dividends  we delivered a total return of to our shareholders in our regional operating teams completed more than million square feet of leasing in while prudently managing transaction costs and non recurring capital expenses and we increased our occupancy from to 
other highlights of our activity include the following we placed in service our new york avenue project  a  square foot class a office building located in washington  dc in which we have a interest 
we placed in service the west garage phase of our seven cambridge center development project located in cambridge  massachusetts which will provide parking for approximately cars 
we continued development on four active construction projects and commenced construction on one additional project during the year  which aggregate an estimated total investment of million as of december  in late december  we acquired prospect place  a  square foot class a office building  for a purchase price of million 
we intend to invest an additional million in this property 
also  in december  our value added fund acquired billerica road  an  square foot office property  for a purchase price of approximately million  of which our share was approximately million 

table of contents during  we adopted an interest rate hedging program 
as of december   we had entered into twelve forward starting interest rate swap contracts which fix the ten year treasury rate for anticipated financings in early at a weighted average rate of per annum on notional amounts aggregating million 
looking ahead we believe the best utilization of our management skills is in the continued success of our development strategies 
given current market conditions  we generally believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be significantly greater than those we can expect to realize from acquisitions 
as a result  we continue to pursue new development opportunities  which is one of our core capabilities 
we are also considering alternative uses ie  non office for some of our land holdings and may participate or undertake alternative development projects 
we also expect that allocators of capital will continue to place a premium on high quality  well located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot 
as an owner of these types of assets  we are pleased with higher valuations  and in we intend to selectively sell some of our assets including large core assets to realize some of this value 
while the amount of gross proceeds that we will ultimately realize from these asset sales is uncertain  the company expects that the magnitude of the sales in could be significantly greater than the million of assets sold in however  there can be no assurance that we will sell any of our assets on favorable terms or at all 
unfortunately  the same market conditions that are leading to record valuations for class a office buildings and that make significant asset sales attractive to us are also continuing to make it more difficult for us to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return 
to the extent that we successfully sell a significant amount of assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions  we would  at the appropriate time  decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend  adopt a stock repurchase program  reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities 
such a decision will depend on many factors including  among others  the timing  availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities  our then current and anticipated leverage  the price of our common stock and reit distribution requirements 
at a minimum  we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for the company to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 

table of contents we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
sfas no 
 which was adopted on january   requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 

table of contents a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
revenue recognition base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  debt to market capitalization  and liquidity  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team  and assess the strength growth of the tenant s industry 
as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants  the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral in which case we require a security deposit  and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments  or the tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 

table of contents we maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential loses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of with a rating of representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of representing the lowest credit rating  recording a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space needs ie  expansion downsize  tenant financial performance  economic conditions in a specific geographic region  and industry specific credit considerations 
if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue issue requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
we receive management and development fees from third parties 
management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
we review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project 
profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and 
table of contents acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and at december   and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of  and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data are comparable 
therefore  the comparisons of operating results for the years ended  and show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the total property portfolio 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service  acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of minority interest  minority interest in operating partnership  net derivative losses  losses from early extinguishments of debt  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  general and administrative expense  less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations net of minority interest  income from discontinued operations net of minority interest  gains on sales of real estate and other assets net of minority interest  income from unconsolidated joint ventures  minority interest in property partnerships  interest and other income and development and management services revenue 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
noi excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations 
for example  interest expense is 
table of contents not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions

liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of million of indebtedness that matures on or prior to march   million of which is due in and the remainder in the first quarter of  as well as the early repayment of construction financing collateralized by seven cambridge center totaling approximately million on february   fund capital expenditures  including tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund current development costs not covered under construction loans  fund new property acquisitions  and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we believe that these needs will be satisfied using cash on hand  cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities  as well as cash generated from asset sales 
base rental revenue  recovery income from tenants  other income from operations  available cash balances  draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
consequently  we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from financing activities  will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements

our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments  possible property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements 
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following construction loans  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  income from operations  income from joint ventures  sales of real estate  issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in bplp  and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short term bridge facilities

our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities  to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs 
we generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by bplp  our operating partnership  until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved
