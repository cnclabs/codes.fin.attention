item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we were founded in and have grown to be the largest manufacturer of recreation vehicles rv s and a major manufacturer of commercial buses in north america 
our position in the travel trailer and fifth wheel segment of the industry towables  with the acquisition of crossroads rv  gives us an approximate market share 
in the motorized segment of the industry we have an approximate market share 
our market share in small and mid size buses is approximately 
we entered the foot bus market with a new facility in southern california designed for that product as well as our existing foot and foot buses 

table of contents our growth has been internal and by acquisition 
our strategy has been to increase our profitability in north america in the recreation vehicle industry and in the bus business through product innovation  service to our customers  manufacturing quality products  improving our facilities and acquisitions 
we have not entered unrelated businesses and have no plans to do so in the future 
we rely on internally generated cash flows from operations to finance our growth although we may borrow to make an acquisition if we believe the incremental cash flows will provide for rapid payback 
we invested significant capital to modernize and expand our plant facilities and have expended approximately  for that purpose in fiscal our business model includes decentralized operating units and we compensate operating management primarily with cash based upon profitability of the unit which they manage 
our corporate staff provides financial management  centralized purchasing services  insurance  legal and human resources  risk management  and internal audit functions 
senior corporate management interacts regularly with operating management to assure that corporate objectives are understood clearly and are monitored appropriately 
our rv products are sold to dealers who  in turn  retail those products 
our buses are sold through dealers to municipalities and private purchasers such as rental car companies and hotels 
we do not directly finance dealers but do provide repurchase agreements in order to facilitate the dealers obtaining floor plan financing 
we have a joint venture  thor credit  operated by ge consumer finance  which provides retail credit to ultimate purchasers of any recreation vehicle purchased from a thor dealer 
this retail credit on recreation vehicles is not limited to thor products only 
trends and business outlook the most important determinant of demand for recreation vehicles is demographics 
the baby boomer population is now reaching retirement age and retirees are a large market for our products 
the baby boomer population in the united states is expected to grow five times as fast as the expected growth in the total united states population 
we believe a primary indicator of the strength of the recreation vehicle industry is retail rv sales  which we closely monitor to determine industry trends 
recently  the towable segment of the rv industry has been stronger than the motorized segment 
for the towable segment  retail sales as reported by statistical surveys  inc were approximately even with last year for the months ended june   however the motorized segment was down approximately 
higher interest rates and fuel prices appear to affect the motorized segment more severely 
government entities are primary users of our buses 
demand in this segment is subject to fluctuations in government spending on transit 
in addition  hotel and rental car companies are also major users of our small and mid size buses and therefore airline travel is an important indicator for this market 
the majority of our buses have a year useful life  so many of the buses are being replaced 
according to mid size bus manufacturers association unit sales of small and mid sized buses are up in the months ended june  economic or industry wide factors affecting our recreation vehicle business include raw material costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our product 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
additional increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we were unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts

financial condition and liquidity as of july   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to  on july  short term investments  which are principally investment grade securities composed of asset based notes  mortgage backed notes  auction rate securities and corporate bonds  are generally bought and held for sale in the near term and are classified as trading securities 
trading securities are carried at fair market value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
due to the relative short term maturity average months of our trading securities  we do not believe that a change in the interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of future operations 
working capital at july  was  compared to  on july  we have no long term debt 
we currently have a  revolving line of credit which bears interest at negotiated rates below prime and expires on november  there were no borrowings on this line of credit during the year ended july  the loan agreement executed in connection with the line of credit contains certain covenants  including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we believe that internally generated funds and the line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current needs and any additional capital requirements 
capital expenditures of approximately  for fiscal year ended july  were primarily for planned expansions and improvements of  at our recreation vehicle facilities and  for our bus operations  primarily at our new goshen coach facility 
we paid a special dividend in fiscal totalling  we also bought back  shares of thor common stock in fiscal at a total cost of  the company anticipates capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately  these expenditures will be made primarily for planned capacity expansions and for replacement of machinery and equipment to be used in the ordinary course of business and expansions primarily in our recreation vehicle segment 
critical accounting principles the consolidated financial statements of thor are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity impairment of goodwill  trademarks and long lived assets we at least annually review the carrying value of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives 
long lived assets  identifiable intangibles that are amortized  goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered 
table of contents impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable  however changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair values could affect the evaluations 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported  and changes in the reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by a third party administrator using various state statutes and reserve requirements 
group medical reserves are funded through a trust and are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
we have established a reserve on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data and actuarial information 
we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all our self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
warranty we provide customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate  however actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserves are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provision of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for incomes taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgement is required in assessing the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of recreation vehicles and buses are recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from the company s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
certain shipments are sold to customers under cash on delivery cod terms 
the company recognizes revenue on cod sales upon payment and delivery 
most sales are made by dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  the company receives payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
repurchase commitments it is customary practice for companies in the recreational vehicle industry to enter into repurchase agreements with financing institutions to provide financing to their dealers 
generally  these agreements provide for the repurchase of products from the financing institution in the event of a dealer s default 
the risk of loss under these agreements is spread over numerous dealers and further reduced by the resale value of the units which the company would be required to repurchase 
losses under these agreements have not been significant in the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements  and management believes that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated finan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency related to its operations in canada 
however  because of the size of canadian operations  a hypothetical change in the canadian dollar as compared to the us dollar would not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company is also exposed to market risks related to interest rates because of its investments in corporate debt securities 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations
