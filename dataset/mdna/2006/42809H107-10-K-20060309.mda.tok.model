item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments  exploration and production e p and marketing and refining 
the e p segment explores for  develops  produces and sells crude oil and natural gas 
the marketing and refining segment manufactures  purchases  trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy products 
exploration production the corporation s strategy for the e p segment is to grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner 
the corporation has increased its reserve life in each of the last three years 
at december  and  the corporation s total proved reserves were  million and  million barrels of oil equivalent 
the following table summarizes the components of proved reserves as of december crude oil and condensate millions of barrels us international total natural gas millions of mcf us international total income from continuing operations was  million in  million in and million in the improved results were primarily driven by increasingly higher oil and gas prices during the reporting period

the after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below millions of dollars  except per share data exploration and production marketing and refining corporate interest expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from cumulative effect of accounting change net income income per share from continuing operations diluted net income per share diluted in the discussion that follows  the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis 
management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings 
management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings  since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount 
after tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts 

table of contents the following items of income expense  on an after tax basis  are included in income from continuing operations millions of dollars exploration and production net gains from asset sales hurricane related costs income tax adjustments legal settlement accrued severance and office costs marketing and refining lifo inventory liquidation charge related to customer bankruptcy net loss from asset sales corporate premiums on bond repurchases tax on repatriated earnings income tax adjustments insurance accrual the items in the table above are explained  and the pre tax amounts are shown  on pages through comparison of results exploration and production following is a summarized income statement of the corporation s exploration and production operations millions of dollars sales and other operating revenues non operating income total revenues costs and expenses production expenses  including related taxes exploration expenses  including dry holes and lease impairment general  administrative and other expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization total costs and expenses results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes results from continuing operations discontinued operations income from cumulative effect of accounting change results of operations 
table of contents after considering the exploration and production items in the table on page  the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices  production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses  as discussed below

crude oil production in the united states in included increased production from the llano field which offset natural decline and the effect of the hurricanes 
production in europe was lower due to natural decline and increased maintenance  partially offset by new production from russia 
increased crude oil production in africa is principally due to improved performance from the ceiba field in equatorial guinea 
natural gas production in asia increased due to new production from the jda 
decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately million in and million in operating costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization cash operating costs  consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses  increased by million in and million in compared with the prior years  excluding the hurricane related costs and accrued severance and office lease costs discussed on page production expenses increased in and  principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses  production taxes and fuel costs 
production expenses in also increased due to expanded operations in russia and the jda 
depreciation  depletion and amortization charges were higher in  principally due to higher per barrel rates 
depreciation and related charges were lower in compared with  reflecting decreased production volumes 
unit production costs per barrel of oil equivalent  comprised of production expense  administrative costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization totaled in  in and in unit production costs in are estimated to be to per barrel of oil equivalent 
exploration expenses exploration expenses were higher in  reflecting increased drilling and seismic activity compared with exploration expenses were lower in compared with as a result of lower dry hole costs

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
if either of those criteria is not met  or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project  the capitalized well costs are charged to expense 
indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel  active negotiations for sales contracts with customers  negotiations with governments  operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment  as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets 
the corporation s oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with sec regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible  government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors  must commit to fund the project 
the corporation s oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates 
the oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the supplementary oil and gas data in accordance with fas no 
are determined independently by the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton d m and are consistent with internal estimates 
annually  the corporation provides d m with engineering  geological and geophysical data  actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination 
the corporation s and d m s technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided 
senior management and the board of directors review the final reserve estimates issued by d m 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows the field level for oil and gas assets and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the 
table of contents amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs and the timing of future production  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments 
in accordance with fas no 
 the corporation s goodwill is not amortized  but must be tested for impairment annually at a reporting unit level 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
the corporation s goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the estimated risked present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 
the determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment 
segments the corporation has two operating segments  exploration and production and marketing and refining 
management has determined that these are its operating segments because  in accordance with fas no 
 these are the segments of the corporation i that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporation s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the corporation  is the codm as defined in fas no 
 because he is responsible for performing the functions within the corporation of allocating resources to  and assessing the performance of  the corporation s operating segments 
hedging the corporation may use futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination  to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil  natural gas and refined product prices 
related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices 
generally  these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges and the changes in fair

table of contents the production of motor and other fuels in the united states and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years 
in  new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration 
fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures 
estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with low sulfur gasoline requirements at port reading will approximate million  million of which was spent in the remainder is expected to be spent in capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at hovensa are presently expected to be approximately million in total  million of which has already been spent 
capital expenditures for low sulfur requirements are expected to be million in  with the remainder in hovensa plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
the energy policy act of eliminates the clean air act s mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline 
many states have also enacted bans on the use of mtbe in gasoline  many of which will take effect in as a result  several companies have announced their intention to cease using mtbe  since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the clean air act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement 
in response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace  the corporation and hovensa will phase out the use of ether based oxygenates in the spring of the phase out may adversely affect the amount and type of fuels produced at hovensa and port reading 
both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities  which may necessitate additional capital investments 
the corporation and hovensa are preparing to meet the renewable content requirement for gasoline and do not anticipate that the impact of this requirement will be significant 
as described in item legal proceedings  in the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa s petroleum refining initiative pri 
the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries 
since  the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over of the domestic refining capacity 
negotiations with the epa are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions  the corporation and hovensa may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls 
settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years
