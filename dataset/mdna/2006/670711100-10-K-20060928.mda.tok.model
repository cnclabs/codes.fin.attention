we had two business segments for the years ended june   and pharmacy drug store chain pharmacies and wholesale and retail sales of medical equipment and supplies medical 
business segments are determined by the management approach which analyzes results based on products or services offered for sale 
year ended june  compared to june  net revenues 
total revenues for the twelve months ended june  increased by from june  to  from  in the following table shows revenues by business segment for the years ended june  and business segment increase decrease pharmacies   medical   total for business segments   the pharmacies segment s revenues increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june   due to increased prescription sales revenue and increased dispensing fees 
the pharmacies revenues excluding dispensing fees increased  to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the pharmacies acquired a pharmacy in april  which increased revenues by  the location in waltham had an increase of approximately  to  as compared to  for the year ended june  as the facility continues filling vacancies to physicians  etc 
the remainder of the increase is due to growth of the federal medicare part d drug benefit and the aging of the american population resulting in increased drug utilization 
dispensing fee revenue increased  to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  dispensing fees revenue is recognized from contracts with federally qualified health centers fqhc 
the pharmacies manage three pharmacies owned by federally qualified health centers 
the pharmacies also have contracts to provide pharmacy services to patients of three other federally qualified health centers

they recognize dispensing fees when a prescription is dispensed from the segregated inventory owned by the fqhc 
the medical segment s sales decreased  to  in as compared to  for the year june  internet sales decreased by approximately  due to lower equipment sales as the company has increased prices for equipment eliminating unprofitable sales 
over  was due to the closure of the nevada location in july the remaining decrease of approximately  was due to the medical segment continuing to be pressured by regional and national buying groups able to command larger discounts from manufacturers and able to offer on line purchasing  inventory controls as well as larger competitors who offer lower prices

this increase helped offset lower insurance reimbursements 
the medical segment s gross profit margins increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june  the increase was the result of closing our nevada division  which generally had lower gross profit margins and we also raised prices on the internet 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a increased in to  as compared to  in the following table shows the breakdown by business segment for the years ended june  and business segment increase decrease pharmacies   medical   corporate   the pharmacies s  g a expenses increased  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june   predominately due to increased labor costs of approximately  mainly due to the short supply of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians 
the balance of the increase was composed of advertising expense of  store supplies of  insurance expense of  rent expense of  equipment rental of  legal expense of  and utilities of  the remaining increase of  was a combination of miscellaneous operating expenses 
the medical segment s s  g a expenses decreased  or to  for the year june  as compared to  for the year june  the decrease was due to a combination of the following a reduction in sales related expenses of  a reduction in bad debt expense of  nevada overhead costs of  decrease in shipping charges of  and reduced bulk inventory storage costs and expenses of the corporate segment s overhead increased by  or to  for the year june  as compared to  for the year june  due to increased legal fees of approximately  and stock based compensation expense of  these increases were partially offset by a combination of the following reductions personnel costs of approximately  public relation fees of approximately  and insurance of discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of wholesale and retail sale of equipment and supplies to emergency medical services  fire departments and police departments fire and police segment 
during fiscal  the company evaluated the declining sales and continuing losses for this segment and closed all locations 
income taxes 
the following table shows income taxes by segment for the years ended june  and business segment decrease increase pharmacies   medical   discontinued operations  corporate   in the fourth quarter  the company determined that based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not  that some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company adjusted the valuation allowance to reflect a net deferred tax asset of  consisting of timing differences from depreciation  intangible assets amortization  and inventory allowance 
in  the company s subsidiary  daw  had taxable income and was required to accrue federal and state income taxes

total sales for the twelve months ended june  decreased by 
from june  to  from  in the following table shows sales by business segment for the years ended june  and business segment increase decrease pharmacies   
medical   total for business segments   the pharmacies segment s sales decreased  to  or 
for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the main reason for the decrease was the impact of a renegotiation of an expired contract with one federally qualified health center fqhc  with different terms and conditions  from a replenishment model to a segregated inventory model 
under the former contract  the pharmacies dispensed prescriptions from its inventory and recognized as sales the gross value of the prescription dispensed 
under the latter contract  the pharmacies dispensed prescriptions from a segregated inventory owned by the fqhc and recognized as revenues the dispensing fee paid it by the fqhc 
the remaining contract for the fqhcs are still under the replenishment model 
the dispensing fees totaled approximately  for the year ended june  as compared to approximately  for the year ended june  management expects prescriptions to increase due to an aging population  increased medicare prescription benefits and additional prescription drugs coming to market point to increasing the prescription drug market 
the pharmacies segment s same store sales growth have recently slowed as the total number of prescriptions dispensed within the united states remained relatively constant and many pharmacy benefit management companies pbm s increased the percentage of prescription insurance plans with a required mail order component 
in late november of  the pharmacy segment opened a new location within a medical center in waltham  ma  which was recently acquired by boston children s hospital 
the medical segment s sales decreased  in to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year june  over  was due to increased pressure from regional and national buying groups which are able to command larger discounts from manufacturers and are able to offer on line purchasing and inventory controls 
also  increased pressure continues from larger competitors who offer lower prices 
in addition  physicians and physician groups are being purchased by hospitals which require they purchase from their sources resulting in a decrease of  the balance is due to new buying groups offering lower prices to induce customers to purchase their products and discontinuing sales of products with very low gross profit margins 
internet sales increased approximately  which helped offset the decline 
gross profit margins 
overall gross profit margins were in as compared in the following is a table of gross profit margin percentages by business segment for the years ended june  and business segment increase decrease pharmacies medical 
the pharmacies segment s gross profit margins increased to for the year ended june  as compared to for the year ended june   due to larger discounts from their suppliers because of increased purchasing volume

the entities are anton investments  inc  anton and conway associates  inc  conway 
in december of  the company reevaluated the anton s business and determined to close because of continuing decreased sales and an inability to generate sufficient revenues to cover fixed costs and operating expenses 
in may of  the company evaluated its operations of conway and decided to close operations by june  due to continuing decreased sales and an inability to generate sufficient revenues to cover fixed costs and operating expenses 
this entire segment has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented

restricted assets and uncertainties the pharmacy acquisition agreement  described below  includes provisions whereby the pharmacies are able to restrict the transfer of funds to the parent or to other subsidiaries any funds in excess of their required management fees 
in august of  the company and the shareholders of daw entered into a stock exchange agreement and plan of reorganization whereby the company acquired by exchange with the sellers of the issued and outstanding stock of daw the board of directors of daw is comprised of five members  two from the minority shareholders and two from the company and a fifth director not affiliated with the minority shareholders or the company 
the fifth seat on the board is vacant 
as part of an associated shareholders agreement  the company and the minority shareholders shareholders will not vote any of their shares in favor of  or consent to any merger of daw with another entity or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of daw unless of the daw s board of directors vote in favor of the transaction 
the agreement also provides for the operations of the subsidiary  including cash management  to be managed by the shareholders 
the shareholders of daw have employment agreements which expired in august since the agreements expired  these employees had the right to require the company to purchase all or any portion of their shares of daw in august  the company entered into a forbearance agreement with the minority shareholders which stated accomplished the following the company acknowledges that of the shares of the subsidiaries held by each shareholder the put shares have been offered to the company for purchase 
the shareholders agree to forbear from requiring the company to immediately pay the fair market value of the put shares until the earlier of i the effectiveness of the closing of the transaction s among the company  the shareholders and the subsidiaries with respect to the potential purchase by the company of all of the shares held by the shareholders in the subsidiaries the purchase  which purchase is not required to be  but may be accomplished by payment in full of immediately available funds  and ii july  the company agrees to pay  per month in total to the shareholders from the first business day of august until the earlier of i the closing of the purchase  and ii december   and  per month from and after december  until the closing of the purchase 
daw agrees to advance to the company the amounts necessary to make the monthly payments noted above  which amounts will be repaid by the company to daw with interest at the applicable federal rate upon the earlier of i the closing of the purchase  and ii july  the company pledges shares of its holdings in daw as collateral for the monies advanced to the company by daw to make the monthly payments noted above  which pledge is to be evidenced by documentation necessary to perfect the security interest in such shares no later than august  otherwise the forbearance noted above will be of no further force or effect 
the parties to the forbearance agreement agreed that the fair market value of all of the shares of the subsidiaries held by the shareholders is million 
therefore  the appraisal process set forth in the shareholders agreement to determine the fair market value of the shares of the subsidiaries to be sold by the shareholders becomes unnecessary 
the arbitration clause of the forbearance agreement was deleted in its entirety and replaced with a provision agreeing to jurisdiction and venue in the business litigation session of the superior court for the commonwealth of massachusetts 
the company and the shareholders are presently attempting to negotiate employment agreements and or a buy out agreeable to all parties 
there is also no assurance that the company will be able to successfully negotiate employment agreements and or raise the capital necessary to buy out the shareholders 
should an agreement not be reached capital not be raised  the company will be faced with a number of uncertainties if an agreement has not been finalized by july   the shareholders could seek employment elsewhere and this would  in the short run  leave no management team for the pharmacies and cause the company to have to assemble an entire new management team 
three of the store leases are expiring in fiscal year  including the largest and most profitable one  which is owned by the mother of daw s president 
if an agreement is not negotiated  this lease may not be renewed 
if capital cannot be raised before the required date for the put shares to be purchased by the company  then the shareholders may enforce their rights to have the put shares purchased 
at this time  the company does not have an alternative plan to satisfy the shareholders  and the shareholders may then seek to enforce their rights in a manner which would be material adverse to the company and its shareholders

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrinkage  impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables we maintain a reserve for the amount of receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is estimated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventories included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrinkage  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we considered historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates upon which that our reserves were based  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment in the fourth quarter and annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by estimating the expected future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and comparing this amount to the carrying value 
goodwill impairment in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our tests during the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our companies 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes the company determined that based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not  that some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized and adjusted the valuation allowance to reflect a net deferred tax asset of  in  consisting of timing differences from depreciation  intangible assets amortization  and inventory allowance 
evaluation of our deferred tax assets can and does impact the company s income 
we have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from temporary differences that may affect taxable income in the future 
valuation allowances have been established and maintained for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not  that some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized and  therefore  adjusted the valuation allowance to reflect a net deferred tax asset of  the valuation allowance includes certain state tax nols and certain tax assets which may not be realizable 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
cash 
our cash is in checking accounts 
since these accounts are non interest bearing  there are no risks to us for fluctuating interest rates
