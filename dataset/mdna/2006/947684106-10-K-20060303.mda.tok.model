overview we provide employee internet management eim and web security software products that enable organizations to reduce the risks associated with web based malicious attacks  spyware  and phishing  as well as analyze  report and manage how their employees use computing resources 
at the foundation of our product offering is the websense enterprise software application  which serves as a central policy engine and management and reporting console and enables the extended functionality of our add on products 
websense enterprise gives organizations the ability to enhance network security  improve employee productivity  mitigate potential legal liability and conserve network bandwidth by allowing organizations to identify potential risk areas and implement web access and application usage policies that reduce these risks 
in  we released our first software product  websense internet screening system 
since that time  we have focused our business on developing and selling eim and web security solutions 
websense enterprise and websense enterprise corporate edition are our core web filtering solutions and provide fully featured web filtering and serve as management platforms for related websense add on modules  such as our premium groups  real time security updates  bandwidth optimizer  instant messaging im attachment manager  client policy manager and remote filtering 
we have also created suites of some of our products to address specific customer needs  such as the websense web security suite and websense web security suite lockdown edition 
we currently derive all of our revenue from subscriptions to the websense enterprise based solutions and expect this trend to continue in the future as more offerings are added to the websense enterprise platforms 
in october  we announced an agreement with nortel networks to develop a web content filtering solution to protect gsm umts mobile handsets from receiving and accessing unwanted content 
we expect the product to be generally available from nortel networks in mid during  we derived of revenue from international sales  compared with for  with the united kingdom comprising approximately of our total revenue in both years 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific and latin american markets 
we sell websense enterprise through both indirect and direct channels 
sales through indirect channels currently account for more than of our revenue  and our strategy is to continue to rely on indirect sales channels for a significant majority of our sales 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenue from subscriptions to websense enterprise  including add on modules  on a monthly straight line basis over the term of the subscription 
we recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription contract and are fully expensed in the period the product is delivered 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared with prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts  continued product research and development and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
when a purchase decision is made for websense enterprise  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
other services such as upgrades enhancements and standard post contract technical support services are sold together with websense enterprise and provided throughout the subscription term 
we recognize revenue on a monthly straight line basis  commencing with the month the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement provided collectability is reasonably assured 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver access codes to users and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
upon expiration of the subscription  customers who wish to re subscribe typically must do so at then current rates to continue using websense enterprise 
our revenue is significantly influenced by new and renewal subscriptions  and a decrease in subscription amounts could negatively impact our future revenue 
accounting for share based compensation 
through december   we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  we reviewed our exercise prices and arrived at the deemed fair value for each option grant during with respect to the  options granted during and through march   we recorded deferred compensation of million for the difference between the exercise price per share and the deemed fair value per share at the grant date 
the approximate weighted average exercise price per share and the approximate weighted average deemed fair value per share for the options was and  respectively 
deferred stock compensation was recognized and amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option award programs fin no 
 over the vesting period of the related options  generally four years 
deferred stock compensation was fully amortized as of december  beyond the million of deferred compensation related to our ipo  we recorded no other share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our amended and restated stock incentive plan plan  its predecessor plans or options granted as non plan inducement options as all other options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs 
effective january   we will adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date will include a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods will not be restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoice s 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
factors considered by us included our earnings history  projected earnings based on current operations  and projected future taxable income in excess of stock option deductions 
however  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged against income or additional paid in capital in the period such determination was made 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further explanation of our deferred tax assets 
income tax provision and tax contingency reserve 
significant judgment is required in determining our consolidated income tax provision and evaluating our us and foreign tax positions 
it is our policy to maintain tax contingency reserves for tax audit issues that are likely to occur and can reasonably be estimated 
we review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes  such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  conclusion of tax audits  additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues or rendering of court decisions affecting a particular tax issue 
tax reserve contingencies and changes to the reserves are evaluated and recorded in our tax provision in the period in which the above noted events occur

years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and revenue revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of the addition of new  renewed and upgraded subscriptions from our customers

other income  net net other income increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates realized on our increased balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  compared with december  the majority of our investments of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are tax exempt

provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the annual effective tax rate for was lower than the effective tax rate primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal income tax rate  an increase in tax exempt interest income and an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits 
in and thereafter  we anticipate that our effective tax rate may continue to decrease due to benefits derived from lower tax rates associated with foreign income

other income  net net other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates realized on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities despite increased balances as of december  as compared with december  the lower interest rates were substantially the result of our strategy beginning in the second quarter of to purchase lower interest tax exempt investments in order to maximize the after tax return on our investments 
also contributing to the decrease were realized losses from settled foreign currency forward contracts 
as of december   the majority of our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were tax exempt 
provision for income taxes in  united states and foreign income tax expense was million as compared to million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared to for the annual effective tax rate for was lower than the effective tax rate primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the united states federal income tax rate  an increase in tax exempt interest income and an increase in federal and state research and development tax credits

net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to an increase in our net income  an increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options and an increase in deferred revenue subscription amounts in excess of recognizable revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
our operating cash flow is significantly influenced by subscription renewals and accounts receivable collections  and a decrease in subscription renewals or accounts receivable collections would negatively impact our operating cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with net cash used in investing activities of million in the million decrease in net cash used by investing activities in was primarily due to fewer purchases of marketable securities to offset maturities and sales of marketable securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared with net cash used by financing activities of million in the million increase in net cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to the use of million for repurchases of  shares of our common stock in  compared with the use of million for repurchases of  shares of our common stock in we have operating lease and software license commitments of approximately million in  million in  and million in a significant majority of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease  which extends through our corporate headquarters lease includes escalating rent payments from to the rent expense related to our corporate headquarters lease is recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
future minimum annual payments under non cancelable operating leases and software licenses at december  are as follows in thousands operating leases software licenses total as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
on april   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
on august   we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions 
depending on market conditions and other factors  purchases under this program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program  for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
as of december   we had retired all  shares of our common stock that had been repurchased prior to that date 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins  the treasury stock retirement was effected by reducing the following on our consolidated balance sheets treasury stock by million  common stock by million  additional paid in capital by million and retained earnings by million 
there was no effect to our overall equity position as a result of the retirement 
we do not expect to retire shares of our common stock that we repurchased during  or shares that we may repurchase during  in the foreseeable future 
on january   we announced that our board of directors authorized a two for one stock split of our common stock  to be effected in the form of a special dividend of one share of our common stock for each share outstanding 
the additional shares issued as a result of the stock split will be distributed on or about march  to stockholders of record at the close of business on february  the shares and per share data presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have not been restated to give effect to this pending stock split 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements and stock repurchases in interest bearing  investment grade securities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we primarily invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments  municipal securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our short term available for sale investments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and zero cost collar contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets and liabilities 
in april  we began billing customers in euro denominated countries in the euro 
in addition  working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries are kept in the local currencies in which they do business 
our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december  and we had committed to foreign currency forward contracts in the euro with a notional amount of and million  respectively 
our euro commitment at december  and  represents and million euros at a weighted average forward rate of and  respectively 
the fair value of these forward contracts was and million at december  and all of the foreign currency forward contracts will be settled before march  the million increase in our euro hedged position is primarily due to our billing customers in euro denominated countries in the euro  starting in april for the year ended december   less than of our total billings were denominated in the euro 
in  we will continue billing certain international customers in euros  and we expect to continue to hedge the corresponding exposure consistent with we do not expect foreign currency billings to represent more than of our total billings during as of december   we had committed to zero cost collar contracts in the british pound  with a notional amount of million 
as of december  we had committed to foreign currency forward contracts in the british pound  with a notional amount of million 
as of december   our british pound commitment represents million british pounds at a weighted average ceiling and floor of and  respectively 
as of december   our british pound commitment represented  british pounds at a weighted average forward rate of 
the fair value of these zero cost collar and foreign currency forward contracts was and million at december  and  respectively 
all of the zero cost collar contracts will be settled before june  the million increase in our british pound hedged position is primarily due to our decision to lengthen the period hedged as well as increase the percentage of working funds hedged 
in  we expect an increase in british pound expenditures and our corresponding hedged commitments to be consistent with our increase in overall operating expenditures 
given our foreign exchange position  a change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures
