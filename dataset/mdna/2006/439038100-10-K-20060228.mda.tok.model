table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview over the four year period ended november   the company has operated in a sluggish economy impacted by low to moderate levels of consumer confidence and growing consumer preference for lower priced imported furniture products 
the company s results of operations have been affected in opposing ways by lower priced imported furniture 
first  the company s domestic wood furniture manufacturing operations have suffered from lower demand and significant declines in volume for bedroom  home office  home entertainment and other products 
these declines led to the closing of the company s pleasant garden  nc facility in  maiden  nc facility in and kernersville  nc facility in  a workforce reduction at the martinsville  va facility in and reduced work schedules at the company s wood furniture manufacturing facilities over most of the period since the company s domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing operations experienced reduced shipments in the third and fourth quarters  and reduced work schedules in the fourth quarter 
second  net sales of the company s imported wood and metal furniture have experienced significant growth during this four year period  and imported upholstered furniture net sales have experienced significant growth during the current year 
net sales of imported products have increased to record levels every year since and have grown as a percentage of total net sales  from in to in the company s results of operations during were principally impacted by the following factors a or million decline in net sales a decrease in gross profit margin in to compared to in declines in gross profit margin for domestically produced wood furniture and for upholstered furniture offset a slight increase in gross profit margin for imported wood and metal furniture 
a or million increase in selling and administrative expenses principally due to higher warehousing costs resulting from higher imported product shipments and additional warehousing facilities  distribution programs and supply chain management initiatives  and higher sales and marketing expense related to the company s introduction of multi category whole home collections and store within a store smartliving showplaces with existing retailers 
restructuring and asset impairment charges increased to million million after tax  or per share principally related to the closing of the pleasant garden  nc facility in october 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended november  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges operating income other income  net income before interest and income taxes interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to net sales of million for the year ended november   declined million  or  from million in in  hooker achieved record sales levels in imported wood and metal furniture and bradington young upholstered furniture 
these sales gains were more than offset by a significant decline in shipments of the company s domestically produced wood furniture 
annual net sales by product category were as follows wood and metal furniture net sales declined by million  or  to million in versus million in domestic wood furniture net sales dropped to million in from million in  a decline of million  or  principally due to lower incoming order rates and more aggressive pricing and discounting 
domestic wood furniture net sales decreased to of total net sales in compared to in imported wood and metal furniture net sales  including record level shipments under the company s container direct program  grew to million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in upholstered furniture net sales grew by million  or  to million in  compared to million during increasing shipments of imported upholstered furniture  introduced in the spring of  more than offset a slight decline in orders and shipments of domestically produced upholstered furniture 
upholstered furniture net sales increased to of total net sales in from in management believes that net sales growth for hooker s imported wood and metal furniture was the result of stylish and innovative new furniture designs  groups and whole home collections such as preston ridge and intimate home  growth in container direct capabilities  orders and shipments resulting  in part  from the company s web based ordering system that provides retailers with the ability to more easily configure containers with a variety of products that are shipped from offshore facilities directly to the retailer  and investments in marketing media  advertising and retail support services and materials  including the introduction of smartliving store within a store galleries  and intimate home boutiques as well as the expansion of seven seas collection boutiques 
net sales growth for bradington young upholstered furniture operations was principally the result of sales of newly introduced products  including new leather and fabric products designed for hooker whole home collections  and sales growth in imported seven seas seating products  launched in the spring of  targeted at the medium and upper medium upholstery market niches  which represents a lower priced starting point for bradington young 

table of contents during  average selling prices declined compared to average selling prices declined for domestically produced wood furniture as a result of aggressive pricing  discounting and the mix of products shipped  and declined for upholstered products due to the mix of products shipped  including increased sales of lower priced imported upholstered furniture 
these declines more than offset increased average selling prices for imported wood and metal furniture resulting from the changing mix of products shipped 
gross profit margin declined to of net sales in compared to in  due to declining gross profit margin for both upholstered furniture and domestic wood furniture  partially offset by improved gross margin for imported wood and metal furniture 
the decline in demand for domestic wood furniture caused underutilization of the company s domestic production capacity  which in turn led to production inefficiencies resulting in increased labor and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales 
this  coupled with aggressive pricing and promotional discounts  contributed to the decline in gross profit margin for domestic wood furniture 
the decline in gross profit margin for upholstered furniture resulted from the underutilization of domestic capacity in the second half of the year  higher employee benefits cost  principally for health insurance  and higher material costs  principally for foam 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  or of net sales in from million  or of net sales in principally due to the following higher warehousing and distribution expenses resulting from increased demand for imports 
imported furniture typically requires a higher level of sourcing  warehousing and distribution costs compared to domestically produced furniture 
increasing levels of expense were also a result of launching new collections and the seven seas seating program  and investing in warehousing facilities  distribution programs and supply chain management 
these expenses include higher information technology and distribution costs principally to support operations such as the distribution center and warehouse located in china owned and operated by vendors and the new initiatives in supply chain management  increased sales and marketing expenses  principally as a result of increased trade advertising and marketing support related to the company s introduction of multi category whole home collections and store within a store smartliving showplaces  and a one time charge to depreciation expense in the first quarter of of   after tax  or per share to correct an error in the application of gaap related to amortizing leasehold improvements 
the company reduced the estimated useful lives of certain leasehold improvements at its high point  nc showroom to correspond with the remaining term of the related lease 
the impact of this charge was immaterial to results and results in each of the prior periods in which the error arose 
these increases in selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by reduced compliance costs related to corporate governance and financial reporting mandates under the sarbanes oxley act 
esop cost including administrative costs decreased  to million compared to million in the same period  principally due to a decline in the average market price of the company s common stock 
the company records non cash esop cost for the number of shares that it commits to release to eligible employees at the average market price of the company s common stock during each respective period based on the amount of the annual principal and interest payments made on the esop loan 
the esop committed to release approximately  shares at an aggregate market value of million  or per share during compared to approximately  shares at an aggregate market value of million or per share during the esop shares have a cost basis of per share 
the cost of the plan is allocated between cost of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses based on employee compensation 
profitability for both and was impacted by restructuring charges related to plant closings 
competitive pressures from consumer preference for lower priced imports  which have caused continuing declines in orders and shipments of domestically produced wood furniture  led to decisions to close the pleasant garden and maiden  nc facilities 
during  the company recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million million after tax or per share principally related to the october closing of its pleasant garden  nc plant million  and the september consolidation of related plywood production at its martinsville  va 
manufacturing facility  which included million in severance and related benefits for approximately hourly and salaried employees  million in related asset impairment charges and  for other costs to prepare the property for sale  and additional costs of  related to its maiden  nc facility which closed in and its kernersville  nc facility which closed in consisting of  principally for additional asset impairment and health care expenses related to the sale of the maiden real property  and

in connection with the closing of the pleasant garden facility  the company transferred related plywood production from a facility located in martinsville  va 
to its main martinsville manufacturing facility 
the company completed this transfer in the fourth quarter and expects to complete the conversion of this separate facility into a finished goods warehouse during the first quarter 
during  the company reclassified to assets held for sale the real and personal property at the pleasant garden facility and certain plywood production equipment located at the martinsville plywood facility  with an aggregate carrying value of million net of anticipated selling expenses 
these assets are included in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of november  in december  the company sold the majority of the machinery and equipment  having a carrying value of  for an aggregate consideration of  in cash  net of selling expense 
the company is actively marketing the remaining real and personal property and anticipates that they will be sold within the next twelve months 
the company anticipates recording  to  of additional restructuring charges  principally disassembly costs  which will be expensed as incurred during  in connection with the sale of the pleasant garden real property 
the restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled million million after tax or per share and included costs related to the october closing of its maiden  nc manufacturing facility million  which included  in severance and related benefits for approximately hourly and salaried employees and approximately  in related asset impairment and other costs to prepare the facility for sale  and additional health care costs  related to its kernersville  nc facility  which closed in the maiden  nc real property  machinery and equipment  with a carrying value of million as of november   were reclassified to assets held for sale 
all of these assets were sold during the first half for an aggregate consideration of million in cash  net of selling expense  and a note receivable of  as a result of the above  operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  compared to in other income  net declined by  to  in from  in miscellaneous cash receipts and interest income declined compared to the prior year 
interest expense decreased  to million during from million in the decrease is due to lower debt levels partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates 
debt declined principally due to a million debt prepayment made by the company in may and other scheduled debt repayments made during the company s effective tax rate decreased to in compared to in  principally as a result of lower state income taxes partially offset by the effect of assessments from a captive insurance company which provides certain insurance coverage to hooker furniture 
certain assessments from this captive insurance company are treated as capital contributions for income tax purposes and accordingly are not deductible 
net income for of million  or per share  declined million  or  compared to net income of million  or per share

improved profitability performance in compared with was achieved despite significant additional expenses  such as restructuring costs associated with the october closing of the maiden  nc plant and expenses incurred to comply with corporate governance and financial reporting mandates brought about by the sarbanes oxley act 
improvement in net sales  net income and profitability as a percentage of net sales in was principally driven by higher unit volume and improved gross profit margin 
increases in net sales for were attributed to unit volume growth in hooker s imported furniture and growth in the bradington young line of upholstered furniture  partially offset by decreased shipments of domestically produced wood furniture 
during  average selling prices increased for imported wood and metal furniture  and increased slightly for domestic wood furniture  but 
table of contents declined for upholstered furniture  compared to overall  average selling prices increased slightly in compared to annual net sales by product category were as follows wood and metal furniture net sales grew by million  or  to million in from million in imported wood and metal furniture net sales  including shipments under the company s container direct program  grew to million  an increase of compared to million in imported wood and metal furniture net sales increased to of total net sales in from in the prior year

while the company provided a four fold increase in the number of professional sales representatives selling this line  net sales growth exceeded the growth rate in related selling and distribution expenses 
consequently  these expenses declined as a percentage of upholstered furniture net sales 
gross profit margin increased to of net sales in compared to in the increased proportion of imported wood and metal furniture shipments helped to improve gross profit margin in  since these products typically carried higher gross profit margins than domestically manufactured products however  imported furniture typically required a higher level of sourcing  warehousing and distribution costs  which are reflected in selling and administrative expenses  compared to domestically produced furniture 
the gross profit margin on imported furniture increased during compared to  based on the mix of products sold and reduced assembly costs 
the improvement was partially offset by higher levels of shipments under the company s container direct program 
products shipped under the container direct program had higher volume discounts than imported products shipped from domestic warehouses 
gross profit margin on domestically produced wood furniture improved slightly during  helped by lower levels of promotional discounting and lower domestic wood furniture production costs as a percentage of net sales 
the production cost margin improved based on steps taken to more closely align production capacity with demand 
bradington young s gross profit margin approximated the gross profit margin 
improved raw material utilization and lower overhead costs  resulting from higher unit volume  were offset by higher labor and benefits costs principally non cash esop cost 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase is principally due to the following higher professional services and personnel expenses incurred to comply with accounting  internal control and corporate governance mandates brought about by the sarbanes oxley act of and new sec and nasdaq rules and regulations

as a part of its business operations  the company s manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
the company is in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which the company believes is material to its results of operations or financial position 
the company s policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with the company s environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that actual results will deviate materially from its estimates related to the company s accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company and actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of the company s inventories is determined using the dollar valued  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of goods sold  while the ending inventories on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to the application of lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of goods sold and lower profitability as compared to the fifo method 
the company evaluates its inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
the company establishes an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment by management and actual values may differ from the company s estimate 

table of contents long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of those assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s domestic furniture manufacturing operations have suffered from lower demand and significant declines in volume for its bedroom  home office  home entertainment and upholstered leather furniture principally due to competition from lower priced imported furniture products 
these declines led to the closing of the company s pleasant garden  nc facility in october  its maiden  nc facility in october and its kernersville  nc facility in august as a result of these plant closings  the company recorded restructuring charges principally consisting of asset impairment charges and severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees affected by the closings 
the company recognizes liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of manufacturing facilities are based on the company s best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses  for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
management reassesses its accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period of change

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements with respect to interest rates 
the company s obligations under its lines of credit and term loan bear interest at variable rates 
the company s outstanding long term debt including current maturities as of november  amounted to million under term loan a 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that  in effect  fixes the rate of interest on term loan a at through the notional principal value of the swap agreement is substantially equal to the outstanding principal balance of term loan a 
a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents for imported products  the company generally negotiates firm pricing denominated in us dollars with its foreign suppliers  for periods typically of up to one year 
the company accepts the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
more of the company s imports are purchased from china than from any other country 
the chinese currency  formerly pegged to the us dollar  now floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in additional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since the company transacts its imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price the company pays for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
the company generally expects to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices it charges for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods
