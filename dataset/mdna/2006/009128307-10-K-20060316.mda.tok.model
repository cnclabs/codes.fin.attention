item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
this report  including the information incorporated by reference  contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the use of any of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our possible or assumed future results  size  structure and growth of our air medical services and products markets  continuation and or renewal of hbm contracts  acquisition of new and profitable products division contracts  flight volume and collection rates for cbm operations  and other matters 
the actual results that we achieve may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors section of this report  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other sections of this report  as well as in our quarterly reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following community based model cbm provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service 
revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
in the cbm division generated of our total revenue  increasing from in and in hospital based model hbm provides air medical transportation services to hospitals throughout the us under exclusive operating agreements 
revenue consists of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospital customers 
in the hbm division generated of our total revenue  decreasing from in and in products division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the products division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
fluctuations in flight volume have a greater impact on cbm operations than hbm operations because of cbm revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to of hbm revenue 
by contrast  of the company s costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for cbm operations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for cbm bases open longer than one year same base transports were approximately  in  unchanged from reimbursement per transport 
net reimbursement per transport for cbm and hbm at risk operations is primarily a function of price  payor mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient 
bad debt expense is estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience 
the provision is adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we increased prices for our cbm operations approximately effective september  effective march  and effective october  contributing to an increase of in net revenue after bad debt expense per transport from to the total provision for expected uncollectible amounts  including contractual discounts for medicare medicaid and bad debts  decreased from of related gross flight revenue in to in in we increased staffing in the billing and collections department  segmented billing by region  and hired a national billing director 
in the third quarter of  we also upgraded our software systems for patient billing 
we believe that these organizational changes to the billing department resulted in more timely billing and follow up on outstanding accounts and  therefore  in an improvement in collection rates 
aircraft maintenance 
both cbm and hbm operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers oem s tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
five models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
we entered into two long term purchase commitments in for a total of aircraft and into two additional purchase commitments in for ten aircraft 
all new aircraft delivered under these commitments are expected to replace the discontinued models and other older aircraft over the next five to seven years 
as of december   we had taken delivery of eleven aircraft under these commitments 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense for cbm and hbm operations increased from to  while total flight volume for cbm and hbm operations increased over the same period 
in we began to realize some of the benefits of our efforts to modernize our fleet  as deliveries of new aircraft allowed us to redeploy some older models into lower utilization markets or into the backup fleet 
in addition  engine upgrades performed in prior periods and standard pricing contracts covering several key components of certain models of aircraft helped to contain operating costs during approximately fewer engine overhauls were performed during compared to the prior year  due to normal operating cycles 
competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our regional competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
deploying multiple aircraft in a market also serves as a barrier to entry for lower cost providers 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
in september  our pilots voted to be represented by a collective bargaining unit and negotiations on a collective bargaining agreement began in early in november  we provided the union a settlement offer which was modified and tentatively accepted by the union in march  subject to ratification by the union membership and approval by our board of directors 
the settlement offer included changes to base salary and overtime pay and to our contribution to k plans 
if ratified by the union membership prior to march   the agreement will be effective january   through april  under our proposed settlement  pay for overtime shifts would increase from regular pay rates to times regular pay rates 
we currently maintain two k plans 
under one plan  we contribute of gross pay for all eligible employees and match of the employees contributions up to of their gross pay 
under the other plan  we match of the employees contributions up to of their gross pay 
in the proposed settlement  we will contribute up to of gross pay to both k plans  depending on the level of each employee s participation 
the estimated impact of the proposed change in base salary is million in the year of implementation 
because the impact of changes to overtime pay and to the k plan contributions is dependent upon staffing levels and employee participation in the k plan  the effect on our financial statements cannot presently be fully quantified 
we have also not yet determined the extent  if any  to which the impact of the settlement offer may be offset by price increases 
there can be no assurance that our offer will be accepted by the union or that we will not be subject to a work stoppage if the parties are unable to come to an agreement 
other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to we reported net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   included a loss on early extinguishment of debt of  with a tax effect of approximately 
net income for the year ended december   included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  as discussed more fully below 
operating income was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  growth in operating income for was partly due to an increase in flight volume for cbm and hbm operations  resulting primarily from the opening of new bases or base expansions 
in addition  net reimbursement for cbm operations revenue after medicare medicaid discounts and bad debt expense improved for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
flight operations community based model and hospital based model flight revenue increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  flight revenue is generated by both cbm and hbm operations and is recorded net of medicare medicaid discounts 
cbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons average price increases of approximately for all cbm operations effective september  approximately effective march  and approximately effective october incremental revenue of  generated from the addition of eleven new cbm bases during either or  generated from the provision of air medical transportation services in new orleans  louisiana  and gulfport  mississippi  in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  pursuant to contracts with fema 
closure of three bases during either or  resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately  for the year ended december  consistent same base transports 
excluding the impact of the new bases and base closures discussed above  total flight volume for all cbm operations for was unchanged from the prior year 
higher cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  were offset by milder weather conditions during the remainder of the year 
increase caused by a change in payer mix to a lower percentage of medicare medicaid transports  resulting in lower contractual discounts which are offset against flight revenue 
the decrease in contractual discounts  from of related flight revenue in to in  was offset in part by an increase in bad debt expense 
see discussion of total provision for uncollectible accounts  including contractual discounts and bad debt expense  below under bad debt expense 
hbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons incremental revenue of  generated from the addition of two new contracts and the expansion of nine contracts during either or discontinuation of service under one contract during the first quarter of  resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately  in annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index 
increase of in flight volume for all contracts excluding the new contracts  contract expansions  and the discontinued contract discussed above 
flight center costs consisting primarily of pilot  mechanic  and medical staff salaries and benefits increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to changes by business segment are as follows cbm flight center costs increased  or  to  for the following reasons increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above 
decrease of  due to the closure of base locations described above 
incremental costs of  incurred in providing air medical transportation services in the aftermath of hurricane katrina pursuant to contracts with fema 
incremental costs include employee travel and fuel costs and do not include the base salaries of the employees deployed nor the cost of the aircraft deployed 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
hbm flight center costs increased  or  to  primarily due to the following increases of approximately  for the addition of personnel to staff new base locations described above 
decrease of approximately  due to the base closure described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following addition of helicopters for cbm operations and for hbm operations during either or  resulting in an increase in aircraft operating expenses of approximately  increase of  in fuel costs as a result of the addition of new cbm bases  net of the impact of closed cbm bases 
the addition of new hbm bases and expansion of hbm programs did not have a material impact on fuel costs because hbm customers typically pay for all fuel consumed in medical flights 
increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
decrease in hull insurance rates effective july and again in july containment of maintenance costs 
excluding the impact of new aircraft described above  maintenance costs increased approximately in engine upgrades performed in prior periods and standard pricing contracts covering several key components of certain models of aircraft helped to contain operating costs 
in addition  deliveries of new aircraft allowed the company to redeploy some older models into lower utilization markets or into the backup fleet 
approximately fewer engine overhauls were also performed during compared to the prior year  due to normal operating cycles 
aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  incremental rental expense incurred in for leased aircraft added to the company s fleet during either or totaled  the increase for new aircraft was offset in part by refinancing twelve aircraft at lower lease rates during bad debt expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  primarily due to the increase in related flight revenue 
in addition  bad debt expense as a percentage of related net flight revenue was in  compared to in flight revenue is recorded net of medicare medicaid discounts 
the total reserve for expected uncollectible amounts  including contractual discounts and bad debts  was of related gross flight revenue for  down from for we believe that the improvement in collection rates is primarily the result of organizational changes within our billing department which provided for more timely billing and follow up on outstanding accounts 
bad debt expense related to the products division was not significant in either or medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  in  we completed production of thirteen hh l units and nineteen mev litter systems 
we also began production of eleven additional hh l units and additional mev units 
other significant projects in included production of a multi mission interior for a sikorsky firehawk helicopter for the los angeles county fire department and four modular medical interiors for commercial customers 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture of multi mission interiors  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products significant projects in included production of thirteen hh l units  forty mev litter systems  a multi mission interior for a sikorsky firehawk helicopter for the los angeles county fire department  and four modular medical interiors for three commercial customers 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture of multi mission interiors  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products increased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year 
the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in  primarily due to the change in product mix 
the margin earned on multi mission interiors is typically higher than the margins earned on modular medical interiors for commercial customers 
cost of medical interiors and products also includes certain fixed costs  such as administrative salaries and facilities rent  which do not vary with volume of sales and which are absorbed by both projects for external customers and interdivisional projects 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of upgrades to aircraft  engines  and avionics systems and the purchase of rotable equipment  a new patient billing software system and related hardware  and office and medical equipment for the new bases described above 
general and administrative g a expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting an increase in billing and collections and cbm program administration staff and in pilot training costs to manage the growth in our operations 
g a expenses in also include performance bonuses for executive officers and other management personnel 
g a expenses include executive management  accounting and finance  billing and collections  human resources  aviation management  pilot training  dispatch and communications  and cbm program administration 
g a expenses were of revenue in  compared to in interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  partly as a result of regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and decreased borrowings against our line of credit 
the average balance outstanding against the line was approximately million during  compared to million during in addition  in may we repaid million in subordinated debt  which had an effective interest rate of during  with the proceeds of million in term loans which bore interest at an effective rate of approximately during the remainder of the repayment was funded by draws against the line of credit 
loss on early extinguishment of debt for totaled  and related to the repayment of million in subordinated debt in may we wrote off approximately  in debt origination costs and note discount related to the subordinated debt and paid a prepayment penalty of  to the holders of the subordinated debt 
income tax expense was  or of income before taxes  in and  or of income before taxes  in in we changed our year end for income tax filing from june to december to coincide with our fiscal year end and filed a short period return for the six months ended december  the true up of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of  to deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense in during  net operating loss carryforwards nol s of million  for which a valuation allowance had previously been established  expired 
based on management s assessment  realization of net deferred tax assets through future taxable earnings is considered more likely than not 
year ended december  compared to we reported net income of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   included the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  as discussed more fully below 
before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  we reported net income of  for an increase in flight volume during the year was offset in part by increased aircraft maintenance costs and bad debt expense 
change in accounting method effective january   we changed our method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhaul costs from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method 
under the new accounting method  maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed 
accordingly  effective january   we reversed our major overhaul accrual totaling  for all owned and leased aircraft and reversed the remaining capitalized maintenance included in fixed assets relating to used aircraft purchases totaling  with the balance reflected as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of   net of income taxes of 
in  the impact of the major overhaul accrual relating to aircraft purchased in the rmh acquisition was considered a component of the valuation of the aircraft and did not affect the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill 
accordingly  the change in method to the direct expense method in resulted in a reduction in the asset value assigned to rmh aircraft 
the amount of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to rmh aircraft was due exclusively to depreciation of the asset value or changes in the liability balances which had been expensed subsequent to the acquisition 
therefore  the majority of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to aircraft which were in our fleet prior to the rmh acquisition 
pro forma results  assuming the change in accounting principle had been applied retroactively  are as follows for the year ended december  amounts in thousands as reported pro forma aircraft operations expense   depreciation and amortization   net income   basic income per share 

diluted income per share 

flight operations community based model and hospital based model flight revenue increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  cbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons incremental revenue of  generated from the addition of seventeen new cbm bases during either or purchase of certain business assets from another air medical service provider in southeastern arizona in may  resulting in the expansion of operations from three bases to five 
transport volume for all bases in the region increased during the first four months of compared to the same period in  resulting in incremental revenue of approximately  closure of one base in the fourth quarter of  one in the first quarter of  and one during the third quarter of  resulting in a decrease in revenue of approximately  increase in same base transports 
excluding the impact of the new bases and base closures discussed above  total flight volume for all cbm operations increased in  primarily attributable to improved weather conditions and an increase in flight requests  driven in part by enhanced crew outreach and other marketing initiatives 
average price increase of approximately for all cbm operations effective january   and an average price increase of approximately effective september  decrease caused by a change in payer mix to a higher percentage of medicare medicaid transports  resulting in higher contractual discounts which are offset against flight revenue 
see discussion of total provision for uncollectible accounts  including contractual discounts and bad debt expense  below under bad debt expense 
hbm flight revenue increased  or  to  for the following reasons discontinuation of service under three contracts either prior to or during the first quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter of  one hbm customer converted to cbm operations 
the resulting decrease in revenue from all of these actions was approximately  revenue of  generated by the addition of one new contract during the first quarter and the expansion of three contracts in the second and fourth quarters of annual price increases in the majority of contracts based on changes in the consumer price index 
increase of in flight volume for all contracts  excluding the discontinued contracts and new contracts discussed above 
flight center costs increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to changes by business segment are as follows cbm flight center costs increased  or  to  for the following reasons increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above 
decrease of  due to the closure of base locations described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
hbm flight center costs increased  or  to  primarily due to the following decrease of  due to the closure of base locations described above 
increase of  for the addition of personnel and facilities for the new base locations described above 
increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to  due to the following addition of eighteen helicopters for cbm operations and fifteen for hbm operations during either or the resulting incremental impact for was an increase of approximately  increase of approximately in the number of engine events requiring significant repair or overhaul and increase of approximately in the number of blade repairs for bk helicopters compared to increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown 
decrease in hull insurance rates effective july aircraft rental expense increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  incremental rental expense incurred in for leased aircraft added to the our fleet during either or totaled  bad debt expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due in part to the increase in related flight revenue 
in addition  bad debt expense as a percentage of related net flight revenue was in  compared to in flight revenue is recorded net of medicare medicaid discounts 
the total reserve for expected uncollectible amounts  including contractual discounts and bad debts  increased from of related gross flight revenue for to for we believe the decrease in collection rates is due to general recessionary trends in the economy and a related increase in the number of uninsured patients and in patients covered by medicaid  as well as to the dilutive effect of price increases on collection rates 
bad debt expense related to hbm operations and products division was not significant in either or medical interiors and products sales of medical interiors and products increased  or  from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  significant projects in included production of thirteen hh l units  forty mev litter systems  a multi mission interior for a sikorsky firehawk helicopter for the los angeles county fire department  and four modular medical interiors for three commercial customers 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  manufacture of multi mission interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products significant projects in included the manufacture of eight modular medical interiors for four commercial customers and eleven hh l units 
revenue by product line for the year ended december   was as follows  manufacture and installation of modular medical interiors  manufacture of multi mission interiors  design and manufacture of other aerospace and medical transport products cost of medical interiors and products decreased  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the previous year 
the average net margin earned on projects during was compared to in  primarily due to the change in product mix 
the margin earned on multi mission interiors is typically higher than the margins earned on modular medical interiors for commercial customers 
in addition  aircraft interiors completed for commercial customers during were for new types of aircraft in which we had not previously installed our modular interior  leading to higher engineering and documentation costs and lower profit margins 
cost of medical interiors and products also includes certain fixed costs  such as administrative salaries and facilities rent  which do not vary with volume of sales and which are absorbed by both projects for external customers and interdivisional projects 
general expenses depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   primarily due to the change in the method of accounting for major engine and airframe component overhauls and replacements  as discussed more fully above 
as part of the change in method  we reversed the remaining capitalized maintenance included in fixed assets relating to used aircraft purchases  resulting in a decrease of approximately  in depreciation expense in the decrease was offset in part by depreciation on engine upgrades  medical interior and avionics upgrades  an upgraded flight tracking system  and computer hardware and software placed into service in general and administrative g a expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   reflecting the growth in our operations 
g a expenses were of revenue for  compared to for during the last half of  we formalized the organization structure for our cbm division along regional and program lines and added administrative personnel to manage the daily operations of cbm bases 
this increase in administrative staffing was offset in part by a reduction in flight center costs for personnel previously assigned exclusively to a single base of operation 
we also increased the number of billing and collections personnel in to keep pace with the growth in cbm operations and to address a slowdown in collections in early in addition  telecommunications costs associated with dispatch operations increased  in during  we also incurred approximately  in audit fees and outside consultant costs related to the audit of internal controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of these increases were offset in part by a decrease in aviation management costs resulting from the consolidation of faa part operating certificates from four certificates at the beginning of to two certificates by the beginning of interest expense decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  due to decreases in principal balances as a result of regularly scheduled payments and the refinancing of million of debt at lower interest rates during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of we recorded income tax expense of  in and  in  both at an effective rate of approximately 
for income tax purposes  at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million  expiring at various dates through during  nol s of million  for which a valuation allowance had previously been established  expired 
as of december   a valuation allowance had been provided for nol s which were not expected to be realized prior to expiration 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of  as of december   compared to  as of december  the change in working capital position is primarily attributable to the following increase of  in net receivables consistent with increased revenue for the cbm and hbm divisions and increased net reimbursement for cbm operations 
in addition  days sales outstanding for cbm operations  measured by comparing net revenue for the annualized previous month period to outstanding net accounts receivable  increased from days at december   to days at december  the increase in days sales outstanding is primarily due to a software systems conversion in the billing department during the third quarter of and an initiative to centralize the billing and collection function into a single location during the fourth quarter of which we believe slowed the pace of collections temporarily 
increase of  in accrued wages and compensated absences  primarily because of the accrual of performance bonuses not paid prior to year end 
change of  in our net current portion of deferred income taxes  from a net current liability to a net current asset  primarily related to a decrease in the difference between the book basis of the allowance for uncollectible accounts and the tax basis of the allowance 
cash requirements debt and other long term obligations the following table outlines our contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt principal     interest payments     total long term debt obligations     capital leases  interest payments total capital lease obligations  operating leases      aircraft purchase commitments      total      interest payments include an estimate of variable rate interest on our revolving credit facility and notes with principal balances totaling  as of december  variable interest was estimated using the weighted average rate in effect during for each note and the weighted average balance outstanding against the revolving credit facility during balloon payments on long term debt are due as follows  in  in  in  in  in off balance sheet arrangements residual value guarantees we have entered into various aircraft operating leases under which we provide residual value guarantees to the lessor 
as of december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under the guarantees is  no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses with respect to the guarantees  since it is not probable that the residual value of the aircraft will be less than the amounts stipulated in the guarantee 
the assessment of whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantee is based on current market data and our actual and expected loss experience 
aircraft purchase commitments in march  we entered into a commitment agreement to purchase ten eurocopter ec helicopters for approximately million  with deliveries scheduled through the first quarter of as of december   we had taken delivery of all aircraft under the agreement 
in july  we entered into a commitment agreement to purchase fifteen bell helicopters for approximately million  beginning in  with a minimum of three deliveries per year 
the agreement provides for special incentives  including a trade in option for up to fifteen bell helicopters  with minimum guaranteed trade in values 
in august  we entered into a commitment agreement to purchase six eurocopter ec helicopters for approximately million  with deliveries scheduled in in october  we also entered into a purchase commitment for four eurocopter as helicopters for approximately million 
as of december   we had taken delivery of one aircraft under the agreement 
we intend to place the new aircraft primarily into existing bases and to either sell the aircraft which are replaced or redeploy them into the backup fleet 
typically we have financed aircraft acquired under these or similar commitments through operating lease agreements 
letters of credit in august  we entered into a letter of credit with a financial institution to securitize an aircraft leased under an operating lease agreement 
because the aircraft is operated in puerto rico  the lessor is unable to perfect its security interest against the aircraft 
the letter of credit perpetually renews for consecutive one year terms through the end of the lease agreement in july or until the aircraft is moved from puerto rico and reduces the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
the letter of credit amount decreases annually based on reductions in the stipulated loss value of the aircraft under the lease agreement and was  at december  in january  we entered into a  letter of credit with an insurance underwriter in lieu of increasing cash deposits on our workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit may be renewed annually and reduces the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
sources and uses of cash we had cash and cash equivalents of  at december   compared to  at december  cash generated by operations increased to  in from  in  due in part to the improvement in results of operations described above 
receivable balances  net of bad debt expense  increased  in compared to  in  reflecting continued growth in cbm and hbm revenue  an improved net reimbursement rate for cbm operations  and the increase in days sales outstanding as described above 
balances for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased  in  compared to  in  primarily because of the accrual of performance bonuses not paid prior to year end 
cash used for investing activities totaled  in  compared to  in equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of rotable equipment  medical and office equipment for new bases  information systems hardware and software  and upgrades to aircraft  engines  and avionics systems 
in we received  in insurance proceeds for an aircraft destroyed in an accident and sold an aircraft previously classified as held for sale for  equipment acquisitions in consisted primarily of medical interior and avionics installations  information systems hardware and software  and rotable equipment 
in we received  from the sale of two of our aircraft and approximately  from the refund of deposits for the purchase of aircraft  primarily through the arrangement of long term operating lease financing 
financing activities used  in  compared to  in in  we used million of term loan proceeds and additional draws against our line of credit to fund the early repayment of million in subordinated debt and the related prepayment penalty of  we also paid  in debt issuance costs  primarily associated with the amendment to our senior credit facility in may we used proceeds from new note agreements originated in to refinance existing debt with higher interest rates and to fund the acquisition of new software systems and other capital expenditures 
the other primary use of cash in both and was regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in we also paid down our line of credit balance by  senior credit facility on may   we amended and restated our senior credit facility and repaid our subordinated debt facility 
the senior credit facility was further amended on december  the amendments provided for  among other things  million of term loans  an extension of the maturity date to december   and modifications to the financial covenants 
the proceeds from the term loans  along with additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility  were used to repay our million of subordinated debt 
in the second quarter of  we wrote off  in debt origination costs and note discount related to the subordinated debt and paid a prepayment penalty of  to the holders of the subordinated debt 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by thirteen aircraft and substantially all of our accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and general intangibles 
indebtedness under the credit facility has a first priority claim to the assets pledged to secure it 
the facility matures december   but can be prepaid at any time  subject to payment of an early termination fee ranging from 
to if the termination occurs prior to december  as of december   we had  outstanding against the million revolving credit facility and available capacity on the facility of  quarterly principal payments of  on the term loans will commence in november and continue until december  when all remaining principal is due 
the revolving loans bear interest  at our option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by the lenders or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the term loans bear interest  at our option  at either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate as announced by the lenders plus or ii a rate equal to libor plus 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance against the revolving credit facility was and the weighted average interest rate on the term loans was 
payment obligations under the credit facility accelerate upon the occurrence of defined events of default  including the following failure to pay principal or interest or to perform covenants under the credit facility or other indebtedness  events of insolvency or bankruptcy  failure to timely discharge judgments of  or more  failure to maintain the first priority status of liens under the credit facility  levy against a material portion of our assets  default under other indebtedness  suspension of material governmental permits  interruption of operations at any of our facilities that has a material adverse effect  and a change of control in the company 
the credit facility contains various covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to create liens  declare dividends  make loans and investments  enter into real property leases exceeding specified expenditure levels  make any material change to the nature of our business  enter into any transaction with affiliates other than on arms length terms  prepay indebtedness  enter into a merger or consolidation  or sell assets 
the credit facility also places limits on the amount of new indebtedness  operating lease obligations  and unfinanced capital expenditures which we can incur in a fiscal year 
we are required to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility and other notes 
as of december   we had exceeded the limitation on annual capital expenditures  inclusive of leased assets  and had received a waiver from the lenders for the covenant violation 
new community based operations opening a new community based operation typically requires an investment in an additional aircraft  aviation and medical personnel  and crew quarters 
we may take possession of the additional aircraft up to three months prior to the commencement of operations in order to retrofit the aircraft for medical transport 
staff may also be hired a month in advance of the operation start date 
because of the delay between date of transport and collection of receivables from the patients or their insurers  new community based operations may not produce positive cash flow during at least the first three months of operation 
other sources as of december   we have additional equity in encumbered aircraft which could be utilized as collateral for borrowing funds as an additional source of working capital if necessary 
we also have  unused capacity on our revolving credit facility 
we believe that these borrowing resources  coupled with cash flows from operations  will allow us to meet our obligations in the coming year 
outlook for the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
community based model in the first quarter of  we expect to open two new cbm bases in the southeast region and one in california 
in addition  we began services under a one year contract with a military base in california in the first quarter of cbm flight volume at all other locations during is expected to be consistent with historical levels  subject to seasonal  weather related fluctuations 
effective january   we increased prices for our cbm operations an average of approximately 
hospital based model in the fourth quarter of  we expanded one existing contract in north carolina to an additional satellite base 
we have also been awarded a year contract to begin rotor wing operations in montana during the second quarter of thirteen hospital contracts are due for renewal in we expect flight activity for continuing hospital contracts to remain consistent with historical levels 
products division as of december   eleven hh l units and mev units for the us army and three modular medical interiors for commercial customers were in process 
remaining revenue for all contracts in process is estimated at million 
the current us army aviation modernization plan defines a requirement for hh l multi mission medevac units in total over an unspecified number of years 
we have already completed hh l units under the program  in addition to the eleven currently under contract 
the us army has also forecasted a requirement for a total of mev units over four years  we have previously delivered units  in addition to the units currently under contract 
there is no assurance that orders for additional units will be received in future periods 
all segments we implemented a new software system for patient billing in and expect to implement new software for inventory tracking in there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain flight volume or current levels of collections on receivables for cbm operations  renew operating agreements for our hbm operations  or generate new profitable contracts for the products division 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible receivables  deferred income taxes  and depreciation and residual values 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed flight fee revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
flight revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services 
revenue and accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances under agreements with third party payers ie  medicare and medicaid 
estimates of contractual allowances are initially determined based on historical discount percentages for medicare and medicaid patients and adjusted periodically based on actual discounts 
if actual discounts realized are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to contractual allowances may be required 
based on related flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
uncollectible receivables we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the credit worthiness of the patient 
uncollectible trade receivables are charged to operations using the allowance method 
estimates of uncollectible receivables are determined monthly based on historical collection rates and adjusted monthly thereafter based on actual collections 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
based on related net flight revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated uncollectible accounts would have resulted in a change of approximately  in flight revenue 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
depreciation and residual values in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r statement r  accounting for stock based compensation  an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement r requires recognition of the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement and provides for either a modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method for adopting the statement 
the statement will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of we expect to adopt the modified prospective method of implementation 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost will be recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after that date and based on the requirements of statement for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of statement r 
we expect the adoption of this standard to reduce net income in the year ending december   by approximately  this estimate is based on the number of unvested options currently outstanding and exercisable and could change based on the number of options granted or forfeited in fiscal in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error correction  replacing apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and that the correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
all of our product sales and related receivables are payable in us dollars 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our debt obligations and notes receivable  most of which have fixed interest rates  except  outstanding against the line of credit and  in notes payable 
based on the amounts outstanding at december   the annual impact of a change of basis points in interest rates would be approximately  interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  periodically we enter into interest rate risk hedges to minimize exposure to the effect of an increase in interest rates 
as of december   we were party to one interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement provides that we will pay a fixed interest rate on  of notional principal and receive a floating interest rate libor plus on the same amount of notional principal from the counterparty
