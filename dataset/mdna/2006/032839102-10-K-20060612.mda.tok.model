item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth below is a discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations including information on the corporation s asset liability management strategies  sources of liquidity and capital resources  as well as significant accounting policies 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplemental data contained elsewhere in this report 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that require the use of judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of judgment as well as other systematic objective and quantitative methods 
assets are evaluated at least quarterly and risk components reviewed as a part of that evaluation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies allowances for loan losses in item for a discussion of risk components 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights requires the use of judgment 
mortgage servicing rights are established on loans that are originated and subsequently sold 
a portion of the loan s book basis is allocated to mortgage servicing rights when a loan is sold 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from the servicing relationship using current market assumptions for prepayments  servicing costs and other factors 
as the loans are repaid and net servicing revenue is earned  mortgage servicing rights are amortized into expense 
net servicing revenues are expected to exceed this amortization expense 
however  if actual prepayment experience exceeds what was originally anticipated  net servicing revenues may be less than expected and mortgage servicing rights may be impaired 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment  which requires judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of an acquisition in which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of net assets acquired 
the price paid for the acquisition is analyzed and compared to a number of current indices 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
restatement in june  the corporation restated its consolidated financial statements for the years ended march  to march  and each of the quarters of the year ended march  and the first three quarters of the year ended march  this determination was in connection with the corporation s accounting for loans originated by the corporation through the mortgage partnership finance mpf program of the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlb 
the corporation has participated in the mpf program by originating loans on an agency basis through the mpf program  but has determined that it incorrectly accounted for these transactions as sales of loans under sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas 
the correction of this accounting required the corporation to reverse gains on agency loan sales related to the mpf program and to remove from its consolidated balance sheet related mortgage servicing rights previously included in accrued interest on investments and loans and other assets 
the corporation s operating results were also adjusted to remove from loan servicing income the amortization expense and impairment charges associated with the de recognized mortgage servicing rights and to reflect the tax consequences of the adjusted pre tax income 
finally  the corporation has reported as a separate line item in its consolidated statements of income credit enhancement income 
previously  this income was included in loan servicing income 
the effect of these accounting changes was to reduce net income by   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a summary of the effects of these changes on the corporation s consolidated statements of income for the year ending march  the accompanying management s discussion and analysis gives effect to the restated financial statements

segment review the corporation s primary reportable segment is community banking 
community banking consists of lending and deposit gathering as well as other banking related products and services to businesses  governments and consumers and the support to deliver  fund and manage such banking services 
the corporation s real estate segment invests in real estate developments 
the corporation s profitability is predominantly dependent on net interest income  non interest income  the level of the provision for loan losses  non interest expense and taxes of its community banking segment

net income decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this decrease in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a million decrease in non interest income  primarily due to a million decrease in income from the corporation s real estate segment 
these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in non interest expense of million  due primarily to a million decrease attributable to the corporation s real estate segment  and a decrease in minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations of million 
the decrease in income of the real estate segment was due to the result of the one time sale of lots to a third party which resulted in approximately million of net income after tax in fiscal the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to a larger increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater increase in the yields earned on interest earning assets as compared to the increase in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal increased  as did the average cost on 
table of contents interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest rate spread was reflective of an increase in the yields on loans  which was slightly offset by a smaller increase in the cost of funds as interest rates rise 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities as set forth under rate volume analysis below 
the analysis indicates that the increase of million in net interest income stemmed from net rate volume increases in interest earning assets of million offset by the net rate volume increases of interest bearing liabilities of million 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
although there was an increase in net charge offs of million in fiscal  primarily due to increased commercial business loan charge offs  there was a decrease in non accrual loans  particularly in commercial business loans 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at march  to million at march  the allowance for loan losses represented of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
during fiscal  the corporation revised the methodology used to allocate the loan loss allowance 
a specific reserve is now placed on substandard loans rather than utilizing more general reserves as in the past 
the categories of performing loans were also analyzed and qualitative factors were adjusted based on collateral and other risk factors 
management believes this change to the loan loss allocation method will be more indicative and consistent with the performance of the respective portfolios in the future 
future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon management s assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in non performing loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimable future losses 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowance as they carry a higher risk of loss 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the decrease of income from the corporation s real estate segment of million for fiscal the decrease in income of the real estate segment was due to the result of the one time sale of lots to a third party in fiscal in addition  net gain on sale of investments and mortgage related securities decreased million 
such gains are subject to significant inter period variations due to changes in market and economic conditions 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in other categories 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  increased million mainly due to an increase in commercial and mortgage fee income 
net gain on sale of loans increased million  loan servicing income increased  service charges on deposits increased  insurance commissions increased  and credit enhancement income increased  non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the decrease of real estate investment partnership cost of sales of million 
in addition  other expenses decreased million mainly due to a decrease in telephone expense  contributions and legal fees  and other expense from real estate partnership operations decreased  these decreases were offset by an increase in compensation expense of million largely due to an increase in insurance and other benefits 
and an increase in data processing expense of  in addition  occupancy increased  furniture and equipment increased  and marketing increased  
table of contents real estate segment 
net income generated by the real estate segment decreased million for fiscal to a loss of million from net income of million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease for fiscal was a decrease of million in partnership sales which was offset in part by a million decrease in real estate investment cost of sales  an million decrease in minority interest in income of real estate partnerships and a million decrease in income tax expense 
partnership sales and cost of sales decreased significantly as the result of the one time sale of lots to a third party which resulted in approximately million of net income after tax in fiscal future sales revenues are based on the interest rate environment 
therefore  management cannot predict future activity 
minority interests 
minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations represents the share of income of development partners in the corporation s real estate investment partnerships 
such minority interest decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the decrease of partnership sales and cost of sales

income tax expense increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal in fiscal  the corporation reached an agreement with the wisconsin department of revenue to pay wisconsin tax on the income of aic  its nevada investment subsidiary 
in fiscal  aic recorded million in state tax expense which was partially offset by a reduction in federal tax expense of  in addition  a state tax payment of  was made in fiscal  which was partially offset by an additional federal tax benefit of  for fiscal the corporation was able to recover million of previously booked federal and state tax provisions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a million increase in non interest income  primarily due to a million increase in income from the corporation s real estate segment 
the increase in income from the real estate segment was mainly due to the one time sale of lots to a third party which resulted in approximately million of net income after tax in fiscal in addition  there was an increase of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of million  due primarily to a million increase attributable to the corporation s real estate segment and an increase in tax expense of  the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were and  respectively  as compared to and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income increased by million during fiscal due to a larger increase in the volume of interest earning assets compared to the increase in the volume of interest bearing liabilities coupled with a greater decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as compared to the decrease in the yields earned on interest earning assets 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities remained steady at in both fiscal and the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal decreased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and the interest rate spread increased to from in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin is reflective of a decrease in the cost of funds  slightly offset by a smaller decrease in yields on loans as interest rates continue to decrease 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities as set forth below 
the analysis indicates that the increase of million in net interest income stemmed from net rate volume 
table of contents increases in interest earning assets of million as well as the net rate volume decreases of interest bearing liabilities of  provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
although there was an increase in net charge offs of  in fiscal  primarily due to increased mortgage and consumer loan charge offs  there was a decrease in non accrual loans  particularly in commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses

also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowance as they carry a higher risk of loss 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the increase of income from the corporation s real estate segment of million for fiscal in addition  loan servicing income increased million primarily due to the decrease in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights  and service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in other categories 
net gain on sale of loans decreased million largely due to the increasing interest rate environment  which resulted in significantly lower levels of refinancing activity 
loan refinance activity and the ability to recognize gains from the sale of fixed rate loans is significantly dependent on decreasing interest rates and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the level of loan refinance activity and gains from the sale of loans recorded in prior periods can be sustained in future periods 
net gain on sale of investments and mortgage related securities decreased million 
such gains also are subject to significant inter period variations due to changes in market and economic conditions 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  decreased million 
insurance commissions decreased  non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the increase of real estate investment partnership cost of sales of million 
in addition  compensation increased million largely due to an increase in insurance and other benefits  other expenses increased million mainly due to an increase in contributions as well as legal and consulting fees  and marketing expense increased million due to an increase in media expense 
furniture and equipment also increased  occupancy increased  and data processing increased  these increases were offset by a decrease in other expenses from real estate partnership operations of  expense associated with regulatory actions amounted to approximately million in fiscal ongoing expense associated with compliance activities associated with these actions is estimated to amount to approximately  to  per year 
real estate segment 
net income generated by the real estate segment increased million for fiscal to million from million in fiscal the primary reason for the increase for fiscal was an increase of million in partnership sales offset by a million increase in real estate investment cost of sales  a million increase in minority interest in income of real estate partnerships and a million increase in income tax expense 
partnership sales and cost of sales increased significantly as the result of the sale of lots to a third party which resulted in approximately million of net income after tax 
future sales revenues are based on the interest rate environment 
therefore  management cannot predict future activity 

table of contents minority interests 
minority interest in income of real estate partnership operations represents the share of income of development partners in the corporation s real estate investment partnerships 
such minority interest increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase of partnership sales and cost of sales

the decrease in income from the real estate segment was the result of the one time sale of lots to a third party in the fourth quarter of fiscal partially offsetting this decrease were increases in other categories 
loan servicing income increased  and net gain on sale of loans increased  non interest expense decreased million to million for the quarter ended march  from million for the quarter ended march  primarily due to a million decrease in real estate investment partnership cost of sales

table of contents financial condition general 
total assets of the corporation increased million  or  from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was primarily all attributable to a million increase in loans  which was funded primarily by a net increase in deposits of million 
mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity increased million during the year due to i purchases of million  ii the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale to mortgage backed securities of million  iii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iv sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million of mortgage backed securities million were available for sale and  were held to maturity and million of mortgage derivative securities all of which were available for sale at march  the decrease in mortgage related securities was largely due to the sale of a group of mortgage backed securities that were sold to reach their maximum profit potential in relation to the changing interest rate environment 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable 
total net loans increased million during fiscal from billion at march  to billion at march  the activity included i originations of billion  ii sales of million  iii principal repayments and other reductions of billion and iv the transfer of loans for securitization of mortgage related securities of million 
during  the corporation originated billion of loans for investment  as compared to billion and billion during fiscal and  respectively 
of the billion of loans originated for investment in fiscal  million or was comprised of single family residential loans  million or was comprised of multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  million or was comprised of construction and land loans  million or was comprised of consumer loans and million or was comprised of commercial business loans 
single family residential loans held by the corporation for investment amounted to million and million at march  and  respectively  which represented approximately and of gross loans held for investment in and  respectively 
in the aggregate  gross multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  construction and land loans  consumer loans and commercial business loans  each of which involves more risk than single family residential loans because of the nature of  or in certain cases the absence of  loan collateral  increased million or from march  to march  but represent approximately and of gross loans held for investment at march  and  respectively 
single family residential loans originated for sale amounted to million in fiscal  as compared to million and billion in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the increasing interest rate environment in fiscal at march   loans held for sale  which consisted of single family residential loans  multi family residential loans and commercial real estate loans  amounted to million  as compared to million at march  
table of contents non performing assets 
non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets decreased to million or of total assets at march  from million  or  of total assets at march  non performing assets are summarized as follows for the dates indicated at march  dollars in thousands non accrual loans single family residential multi family residential commercial real estate construction and land consumer commercial business total non accrual loans real estate held for development and sale foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  net total non performing assets performing troubled debt restructurings total non accrual loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to total non accrual loans allowance for loan and foreclosure losses to total non performing assets total loans are gross loans receivable before the reduction for loans in process  unearned interest and loan fees and the allowance for loan losses 
non accrual loans decreased  in fiscal to million at march  this decrease was largely attributable to a million decrease in non accrual commercial business loans as well as a decrease of million in non accrual commercial real estate loans 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in non accrual multi family residential loans 
the decrease in non accrual commercial business loans was largely attributable to the charge off of one loan in the amount of million 
the decrease in non accrual commercial real estate loans was attributable to one loan  which had a carrying value of million at march  and was paid off 
the increase in non accrual multi family residential loans was attributable to one loan in the amount of million 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  in fiscal this increase was not attributable any one property 
at march  and  there were no troubled debt restructurings 
potential problem loans 
management utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
at least quarterly  a list is presented to the bank s board of 
table of contents directors showing all loans listed as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
a special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan at some future date 
an asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and viewed as non bankable assets  worthy of charge off 
assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that may or may not be within the control of the customer are deemed to be watch loans 
as of march   loans classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss loans totaled million compared to million as of march   a decrease of  the decrease is in keeping with local and national economic conditions 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the subsidiary banks primary regulators  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the ots  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that i institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  ii management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and iii management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
we have established an adequate allowance for probable loan losses 
we analyze the process regularly  with modifications made if needed  and report those results four times per year to the bank s board of directors 
however  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to materially increase our allowance for loan losses at the time 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
allowances for loan and foreclosure losses 
the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  and repossessed assets are evaluated on a continuous basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and losses inherent in the portfolio 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
to determine the level and composition of the loan loss allowance  the loan portfolio is broken out by categories of single family residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate  construction and land  consumer and commercial business 
these categories are then further divided into performing and non performing 
within the non performing category  loans are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss 
a five year historical trend is developed for each category of loan outlined above to arrive at the historical loss level of each category 
this historical ratio of loss reserves and other ratios are applied to the respective performing and non performing categories of loans to arrive at the appropriate level of loss reserve for each loan category 
for commercial business loans  a four year historical trend is applied since that category has shown significant growth both in terms of overall balance and loss history associated with that growth 
the corporation has allocated all of its allowance for loan losses to specific categories as a result of its analysis of the loan portfolio 
also  within specific loan categories  certain loans may be identified for specific reserve allocations 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on 
table of contents appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers 
the following table sets forth the activity in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated 
year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of year purchase of ledger capital corp 
charge offs mortgage consumer commercial business total charge offs recoveries mortgage consumer commercial business total recoveries net charge offs provision allowance at end of year net charge offs to average loans held for sale and for investment loan charge offs were million and million for the fiscal years ending march  and  respectively 
total charge offs for the years ended march  and increased million and  respectively  from the prior fiscal years 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of million in commercial business charge offs  which was offset in part by a million decrease in mortgage loan charge offs and a  decrease in consumer loan charge offs 
the increase in charge offs for fiscal was largely due to an increase of million in mortgage loan charge offs as well as a  increase in consumer loan charge offs  which were offset in part by a million decrease in commercial business charge offs 
recoveries decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal recoveries increased  during the fiscal year ended march  management believes that the million increase in net charge offs for the year ended march  and the  increase in net charge offs for the year ended march  do not represent an overall change in the quality of the loan portfolio 
during fiscal  management decided to charge off two large commercial credits totaling million  which were appropriately reserved for in prior years 
one was a million commercial business loan secured by a computer software and consulting company located in arizona

management also continues to pursue all practical and legal methods of collection  repossession and disposal  and adheres to high underwriting standards in the origination process in order to continue to maintain strong asset quality 
deposits 
deposits increased million during fiscal to billion  of which million was due to increases in certificates of deposit  million was due to increases in money market accounts and million was due to increases in interest bearing checking accounts 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in passbook accounts 
the increases were due to promotions and related growth of deposit households as interest rates begin to edge upward in fiscal deposits obtained from brokerage firms which solicit deposits from their customers for deposit with the corporation amounted to million at march   as compared to million at march  the weighted average cost of deposits increased to at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end borrowings 
fhlb advances increased million during fiscal at march   advances totaled million and had a weighted average interest rate of compared to advances of million with a weighted average interest rate of at march  other loans payable increased million from the prior fiscal year 
other loans payable consist of borrowings of the corporation of million  which was primarily for the purpose of the corporation s stock repurchase program  an increase of million over march  in addition  borrowings by the partnerships of idi s subsidiaries were million at march   an increase of million over march  per fin  such borrowings are consolidated

for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item stockholders equity 
stockholders equity at march  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets at march  stockholders equity increased during the year as a result of i comprehensive income of million  which includes net income of million and a decrease in net unrealized losses on available for sale securities included as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income of million  ii the exercise of stock options of  iii the purchase of stock by retirement plans of million  and iv the tax benefit from certain stock options of million 
these increases were partially offset by i the repurchase of common stock of million and ii the payment of cash dividends of million 
liquidity and capital resources on a parent only basis at march   the corporation s commitments and debt service requirements consisted primarily of million payable to us bank pursuant to a million line of credit and million of mortgage loans to subsidiaries of the corporation secured by real estate held for development 
the weighted average rate on the line of credit was at march  and the line of credit matures in october currently  the corporation uses available funds primarily to fund common stock repurchase programs and loans to idi and other non bank subsidiaries  which amounted to million at march  the corporation s principal sources of funds for it to meet its parent only obligations are dividends from the bank  which are subject to regulatory limitations  and borrowings from public and private sources 
during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation  and at march  the bank had million available for dividends that could be paid to the corporation without application for approval by but with prior notice to the ots 
for the bank  liquidity represents the ability to fund asset growth  accommodate deposit withdrawals  pay operating expenses and meet other contractual obligations and commitments 
see contractual obligations and commitments below 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide deposits obtained from their customers at specified interest rates for an identified fee  or so called brokered deposits 
at march   the bank had million of brokered deposits 
in fiscal  consolidated operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million of net cash paid from the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
consolidated investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and billion for the origination of loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal repayments on loans of billion  proceeds of sales and maturities of investment securities of million and million of principal repayments received on mortgage related securities 
consolidated financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million in fiscal  including a net increase in deposits of million  a net increase in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments at march   on a consolidated basis the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans and commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item commitments to extend funds typically have a term of less than one year 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march  amounted to billion  and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required 
the following table summarizes our contractual principal cash obligations and other commitments at march  payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations vie obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations at march   the bank s capital exceeded all capital requirements of the ots as mandated by federal laws and regulations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management 
the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide consistent net interest income growth and returns on equity while maintaining adequate liquidity over a range of interest rate environments 
to that end  management focuses on asset and liability management strategies that help reduce interest rate risk and attain the corporate goals and objectives adopted by the corporation s board of directors 
the corporation s strategy for asset and liability management is to maintain an interest rate gap that attempts to minimize the negative impact of interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
as part of this strategy  the corporation sells substantially all new originations of long term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  invests in adjustable rate or medium term  fixed rate  single family residential mortgage loans  invests in medium term mortgage related securities  and invests in consumer loans which generally have shorter terms to maturity and higher and or adjustable interest rates 
the corporation occasionally sells adjustable rate loans at origination to private investors 
the corporation also originates multi family residential and commercial real estate loans  which generally have adjustable or floating interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity than conventional single family residential loans 
long term  fixed rate  single family mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market are generally committed for sale at the time the interest rate is locked with the borrower 
as such  these loans involve little interest rate risk to the corporation 
the corporation s cumulative net gap position at march  for one year or less was a positive of total assets 
the calculation of a gap position requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
management believes that its assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
competitive pressures for deposits have made time deposits sensitive to interest rates and may also affect transaction accounts  in particular  passbooks and money market accounts in the future 

table of contents the corporation utilizes certain prepayment assumptions and decay rates from various sources such as the ots and as determined by management 
the following table summarizes the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position at march  interest rate sensitivity for the periods ended fair value thereafter total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets mortgage loans fixed average interest rate mortgage loans variable average interest rate consumer loans average interest rate commercial business loans average interest rate mortgage related securities average interest rate investment securities and other interest earning assets average interest rate total rate sensitive loans total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts average interest rate time deposits average interest rate borrowings average interest rate total rate sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets balances have been reduced for i undisbursed loan proceeds  which aggregated million  ii non accrual loans  which amounted to million 
includes million of loans held for sale spread throughout the periods 
includes million of securities available for sale spread throughout the periods 
loan total and fair value amounts are shown net of respective amounts of million and million in deferred fees and loss reserves 
does not include million of demand accounts because they are non interest bearing 
also excludes accrued interest payable of million 
projected decay rates for demand deposits and passbook savings are selected by management from various sources including the ots 
net interest income sensitivity 
net interest income is a primary source of revenue 
net interest income sensitivity is used to assess the interest rate risk associated with this income in various interest rate environments 
management uses the net interest income sensitivity to provide a perspective on how interest rate pricing affects the corporation s interest rate risk profile 
simulations are processed quarterly and include scenarios where market rates are immediately shocked up and down along with current and anticipated interest rate pricing of 
table of contents interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the sensitivity measurement is calculated as the percentage variance of net interest income simulations to the base results 
the following table sets forth the estimated sensitivity of net interest income for months following the dates indicated 
the calculations are based on immediate changes of and points in interest rates up or down 
basis point basis point basis point basis point rate increase rate increase rate decrease rate decrease march  march  the methods we used in the previous table have some inherent shortcomings 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we make assumptions regarding the acceleration rate of the prepayment speeds of higher yielding mortgage loans 
prepayments will accelerate in a falling rate environment and the reverse will occur in a rising rate environment 
we also assume that decay rates on core deposits will accelerate in a rising rate environment and the reverse in a falling rate environment 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates  when in practice rate changes on certain products  such as savings deposits  may lag market changes 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the net interest income model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our interest income
