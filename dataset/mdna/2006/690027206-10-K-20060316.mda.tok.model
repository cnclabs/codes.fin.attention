general through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  the outdoor channel  inc or toc  we own and operate the outdoor channel which is a national television network devoted primarily to traditional outdoor activities  such as hunting  fishing and shooting sports  as well as off road motor sports and other outdoor related lifestyle programming 
we also own and operate related businesses which serve the interests of the outdoor channel s viewers and other outdoor enthusiasts 
these related businesses include ldma au  inc  which we refer to as lost dutchman s  and gold prospector s association of america  llc  which we refer to as gpaa 
lost dutchman s is a national gold prospecting campground club with properties in arizona  california  colorado  georgia  michigan  north carolina  oregon and south carolina 
gpaa is the publisher of the gold prospector treasure hunters in the great outdoors magazine 
in addition  we are the owner of a  acre property near nome  alaska used to provide outings for a fee to the members of lost dutchman s and gpaa 
outdoor channel holdings also wholly owns bpd  llc which owns the building housing our broadcast facility 
our revenues include advertising fees from advertisements aired on the outdoor channel and from advertisements in gold prospector treasure hunters in the great outdoors magazine  subscriber fees paid by cable and satellite service providers that air the outdoor channel  and membership fees from members in both lost dutchman s and gpaa and other income including magazine sales  products and services related to gold prospecting  gold expositions  expeditions and outings 
advertising fees include fees paid by third party programmers to purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on the outdoor channel 
acquisition of the minority interest of the outdoor channel  inc on september   we completed the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in toc which we did not previously own through i the merger of toc with our newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary  with toc being the surviving corporation  and ii the exchange of each share of toc common stock not previously held by us or our subsidiaries for shares of our common stock 
in addition  each outstanding option to purchase one share of toc common stock was exchanged for an option to purchase shares of our common stock 
in september  every two outstanding shares of our common stock were converted into five outstanding shares of common stock in conjunction with our reincorporation from alaska to delaware the for split 
based on the exchange ratio in the merger we issued  shares of our common stock as well as options to purchase  additional shares  each as adjusted for the for split 
the shares issued include the shares of common stock issued to a former toc shareholder who originally exercised his dissenters rights in connection with the transaction  but who later withdrew  with our consent  the demand to exercise such dissenter s rights 
for accounting purposes  all previously outstanding toc common shares  including the dissenting shares  have been deemed to have been exchanged for shares of our common stock in september the acquisition of the minority interest in toc was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the cost of acquiring the minority interest included the aggregate fair value of our common shares issued in exchange for common shares of toc and certain other direct costs 
the acquisition cost was allocated based on the fair value of the assets of toc that were acquired and liabilities that were assumed  including intangible assets that arose from contractual or other legal rights or met certain other recognition criteria that underlie the minority interest that was acquired 
the excess of the cost of the minority interest over the fair value of the underlying interest in the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
in addition  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas the tax effect of the intangible assets have been treated as additional consideration 
this additional consideration has also been allocated to goodwill 
the cost of our acquisition of the minority interest in toc was  based on the issuance at the closing of  shares of our common stock including shares issued to the former dissenter and the average closing price of per share of our common stock for a specified period before and after april   the last trading day before the public announcement of the material terms of the acquisition plus the assumption of  fully vested options of a former employee of toc with an intrinsic value of  plus certain other costs including income tax effects 
based on the analysis of the fair value of the assets that were acquired and liabilities that were assumed  the acquisition costs of  were allocated primarily to intangible assets as follows allocation in thousands estimated useful life mso relationships indefinite advertising customer relationships short form years long form years total identifiable intangible assets goodwill indefinite deferred tax liability associated with intangible assets minority interest in subsidiary aggregate purchase price the exchange of vested employee stock options by us for vested stock options held by employees of toc resulted in a charge to operations in our consolidated statement of operations on september  equal to the value of the options issued on that date net of any related income tax benefit 
the options to purchase approximately  shares that we issued in exchange for vested stock options held by the employees of toc on september  had a fair value of per share based on the closing price of our common stock on that day 
as a result  we incurred a non cash  non recurring charge to operating expenses of  and recognized an income tax benefit of  or a net charge of  in some of the following period to period comparisons  we have specifically noted  and at times excluded the non cash  non recurring compensation expense of  incurred by us and the related tax benefit of  as the result of the assumption of toc options in connection with our acquisition of the minority interest in toc as part of our analysis because we believe separately quantifying the effects of these items provides the reader with a better understanding of our operating results 
we also believe that an analysis of our results in this manner  when presented in conjunction with our analysis of the corresponding gaap measures  provides useful information to management and others in identifying and understanding our operating performance for the periods presented and in making useful comparisons 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues for the outdoor channel are recognized when the advertisement is aired 
advertising revenues from advertisements in our bi monthly magazine are recognized when the magazine is distributed 
revenues from the expeditions are recognized when they are taken in june through august each year 
revenues from outings and gold expositions are recognized at the time of the event 
subscriber fees for the outdoor channel are recognized in the period the programming is aired by the distributor and collection is probable 
broadcast and national television network advertising contracts may guarantee the advertiser a minimum audience for its advertisements over the term of the contracts 
we provide the advertiser with additional advertising time if we do not deliver the guaranteed audience size 
the amount of additional advertising time is generally based upon the percentage of shortfall in audience size 
this requires us to make estimates of the audience size that will be delivered throughout the terms of the contracts 
we base our estimate of audience size on information provided by ratings services and our historical experience 
if we determine we will not deliver the guaranteed audience  an accrual for make good advertisements is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
the estimated make good accrual is adjusted throughout the terms of the advertising contracts 
we recognize merchandise sales when the product is shipped and collection of the receivable is probable 
lost dutchman s campground membership sales are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated average life years of the membership 
we do not record receivables arising under these contracts 
accordingly  revenues recognized do not exceed the total cash payments received and cash received in excess of revenue earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
the majority of gpaa membership sales is for one year and is generally recognized in the year of sale 
multi year gpaa membership sales are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of a membership  and an estimated life of years for a lifetime membership 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  goodwill and trademarks  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than their carrying value and  accordingly  all or a portion of such carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment losses for assets to be held and used are then measured based on the excess  if any  of the carrying amounts of the assets over their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of in a manner that meets specific criteria are stated at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair values less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may arise if any of our customers are unable to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the age of customer balances  historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness and trade publications regarding the financial health of our larger customers and changes in customer payment terms when making estimates of the uncollectability of our trade accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorated  whether due to customer specific or general economic issues  increases in the allowance may be made 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the income tax provision is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
derivative instruments and certain hedging activity at the time we entered into long term debt agreements  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements change the variable rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows so that we can manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate fluctuations and thus interest rate risk 
these swap arrangements essentially create the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
these referenced transactions are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas no 
these standards require a derivative to be recognized on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value and the changes in fair value to be accounted for as other comprehensive income or loss 
we measure the effectiveness of the interest rate swap derivative by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable portion of the swap with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with the changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the respective hedge s designation and whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability hedged 
we have determined that the interest rate swap agreements we have entered into are highly effective in achieving the offsetting changes in the fair value of cash flows and there has been no ineffectiveness during the year ended december  recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r 
share based payment which revised the standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments  including all options granted to employees  be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
sfas r shall be effective for issuers as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after december  accordingly  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  since we have used the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options  the adoption of sfas r is expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
the fasb had issued certain other accounting pronouncements as of december  that will become effective in subsequent periods  however  our management does not believe that any of those pronouncements would have significantly affected our financial accounting measurements or disclosures had they been in effect during  or comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  the following table discloses certain financial information for the periods presented  expressed in terms of dollars  dollar change  percentage change and as a percent of total revenue all dollar amounts are in thousands change of total revenue revenues advertising subscriber fees membership income total revenues expenses satellite transmission fees advertising programming non cash compensation expense from exchange of stock options selling  general and administrative total expenses income loss from operations nmf other income  net income loss before income taxes and minority interest nmf income tax provision benefit nmf income loss before minority interest nmf minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary net income loss nmf nmf not meaningful revenues our revenues include revenues from advertising fees  subscriber fees  and membership income 
advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time on the outdoor channel including advertisements shown during a program also known as short form advertising and infomercials in which the advertisement is the program itself also known as long form advertising and from the sale of advertising space in publications such as the gold prospectors treasure hunters in the great outdoors magazine 
advertising revenue is also generated from fees paid by third party programmers that purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on the outdoor channel 
for the years ended december  and  the outdoor channel generated approximately and of our advertising revenue  respectively 
subscriber fees are solely related to the outdoor channel 
membership income is generated by our activities other than the operation of the outdoor channel and includes membership sales  magazine sales  merchandise sales  and sponsored outings and expeditions in connection with gpaa and lost dutchman s 
total revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to revenues of  for the year ended december  the net increases were the result of changes in several items comprising revenue as discussed below 
advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  for december  nielsen estimated that the outdoor channel had million viewers compare to million for the same period a year ago 
nielsen revises this estimate each month and for march  nielsen increased its estimate to approximately million subscribers 
the increase in advertising revenue for the year ended december  reflects a larger percentage of our short form advertising inventory being sold to national and endemic advertisers  generally at higher rates  than inventory being sold to direct response advertisers or long form infomercial advertisers 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in subscriber fees for the period was primarily due to an increased number of paying subscribers both from new affiliates and from existing distributors and contractual subscriber fee rate increases with existing service providers carrying the outdoor channel 
we plan to accelerate our subscriber growth utilizing various means including deployment of subscriber acquisition or launch support fees 
such fees are capitalized and amortized over the period that the pay television distributor is required to carry the newly acquired toc subscriber 
to the extent revenue is associated with the incremental subscribers  the amortization is charged to offset the related revenue 
any excess of launch support amortization over the related subscriber fee revenue is charged to expense 
as a result  we anticipate that subscriber fee revenue  net of amortization of launch fees  may not increase over the foreseeable future once we deploy this tactic and  in fact  due to contractual volume discounts  subscriber fee revenue could actually decrease over the new contract lives 
membership income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or compared to  for the year ended december  we do not consider this decline to be significant  rather the relatively static balance reflects our belief that this revenue source has reached relative maturity 
we do not expect significant change in the balance from year to year in the near term 
expenses expenses consist of the cost of satellite transmission fees  advertising  programming  compensation expense from the exchange of toc stock options  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
total expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses was due to the non recurring charge to compensation expense incurred in september as a result of the issuance of options to toc employees with an intrinsic value of  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition by the company of substantially all of the remaining minority interest in toc it did not already own 
otherwise total expenses increased as illustrated when the non cash  non recurring compensation expense of  incurred in september is excluded 
total expenses  net of the compensation expense from exchange of stock options  increased  or for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total expenses  net of compensation expense from the exchange of stock options  were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in expenses was due to several factors  such as increased corporate costs including amortization of intangible assets  costs associated with compliance with sarbanes oxley act of  and costs associated with incorporation in delaware and listing on the nasdaq national market  to which we became subject as of september those increased costs will continue to be incurred becoming part of our cost of doing business 
the increase is also attributable to increased programming and personnel costs  costs associated with the launch of our second channel  outdoor channel hd  marketing and promotion costs and other items more fully described as follows 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase reflects an additional charge for the back up satellite capability negotiated with our satellite provider during the fourth quarter of and a scheduled price increase of  per month in october advertising expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising expenses is principally a result of our increased spending on consumer and trade industry awareness campaigns designed to build demand for the outdoor channel and for outdoor channel hd 
we plan on continuing to spend on these awareness programs  and when expressed as a percentage of revenues  we expect the rate to be closer to the rate experienced in rather than programming expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is principally a result of our decision to launch our second channel  outdoor channel hd  on july  in  this channel was programmed with native high definition shows produced almost entirely in house as opposed to the preponderance of third party production on our standard definition channel 
we produced in excess of shows plus numerous specials in house that aired in the third and fourth quarters of in some situations  shows that ran in on only one of our channels are planned to be aired again in  but on our other channel 
we aired shows that were internally produced during the third and fourth quarters of our policy is to charge costs of specific shows to programming expense over the expected airing period beginning when the program first airs 
the cost of programming is generally first recorded as prepaid programming costs and is then charged to programming expense based on the anticipated airing schedule 
if the anticipated airing schedule changes  the timing and amount of the charge to expense is adjusted accordingly 
many of these programs began airing on outdoor channel hd during the third quarter of with re airing in the fourth quarter and  in some situations  re airing the same programs on the outdoor channel in a substantial portion of the prepaid programming costs has been and will be charged to expense in these quarters 
programming expenses are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue as we pursue our strategy to produce  or acquire  more programming in house as opposed to selling the air time to third party producers 
as a result  we believe we will control more of our programs quality  advertising inventory  sponsorship opportunities and the potential to re package our programming for other uses such as video on demand  international licensing and production of dvds for retail distribution 
compensation expense from the exchange of stock options for the year ended december  was  and was incurred as a result of the issuance of  options to toc option holders in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of substantially all of the remaining minority interest in toc we did not already own 
this charge is both non cash and non recurring 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of employees late in and early we opened our new york city advertising sales office with a resultant expense in that did not exist in the same period a year ago 
we have also added an executive to our management team who holds the position of general counsel 
others have been added in all departments to support our launch of a second channel outdoor channel hd  and to support our increased efforts of producing more of our shows in house 
we also experienced increased travel and related costs associated with our larger advertising sales staff  support of our service providers and the promotion of the outdoor channel and outdoor channel hd through a stronger presence at trade shows and conferences 
depreciation and small equipment purchases have increased as a result of our activity related to the launch of outdoor channel hd 
also included in selling  general and administrative costs is amortization of intangible assets created as part of the acquisition in september of the remaining minority interest of toc we did not already own 
these expenses did not exist in the first half of we increased other corporate overhead expenses such as our activity surrounding sarbanes oxley compliance in  fees for our listing on nasdaq national market and fees associated with incorporation in the state of delaware 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will continue to increase over the foreseeable future both in dollars and when expressed as a percent of revenue as we continue to work to gain increased distribution of both channels including increases from the recognition of subscriber acquisition fee  also referred to as launch support fee  amortization in excess of the related subscriber revenue  corporate spending on sarbanes oxley compliance  fees to maintain our common stock listing and improved communication with our stockholders  among other corporate expenses 
income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percent of revenues  income loss from operations was and  respectively 
as we continue to strive to drive growth of our subscriber base including the planned payment of launch support  and as we further develop our second channel  outdoor channel hd  we will incur increased expenses such as programming  marketing and advertising that are unlikely to be immediately offset by revenues 
as a result  we anticipate our operating margins will be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful 
as explained above  the non cash  non recurring compensation charge of  which resulted from the assumption of options in connection with the acquisition of the minority interest in toc  accounts for the majority of the loss from operations for the year ended december  if we excluded this charge  loss from operations for the year ended december  would have been income from operations of  as a percentage of revenue this adjusted balance would have been for the year ended december  other income  net other income  net for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to increased dividends and interest earned on our increased investment in available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalent balances that resulted from the sale  on july   of  shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of  plus  from the exercise of stock options during the year ended december  income loss before income taxes and minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes and minority interest as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the toc segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenue  the toc segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was due mainly to the growth of our programming expenses and increased staff in support of the launch of our second channel  outdoor channel hd  increased spending on advertising  personnel and travel promotional related expenses as well as depreciation expenses related to the deployment of additional equipment 
the membership division segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenues  the membership division segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease is principally a result of a increase in payroll and related taxes along with a charge for stock compensation that did not exist in corporate incurred a loss before income taxes and minority interest for the year ended december  amounting to  a decrease of  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the expenses allocated to corporate include the non cash  non recurring charge of  professional fees such as public relations  accounting and legal fees  amortization of intangibles  business insurance  board of directors fees and expenses and an allocation of corporate officers payroll and related expenses 
the increase in the expenses of corporate  net of the one time charge in of  is principally related to accounting services incurred in positioning the company to be in compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  taxes associated with being incorporated in delaware  listing fees of the nasdaq national market and amortization of the intangible assets related to the acquisition of the minority interest of toc 
income tax provision benefit income tax provision for the year ended december  was  an increase of  as compared to a benefit of  for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to the company earning taxable income in as compared to a loss for the effective income tax rate was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary minority interest for the year ended december  was  minority interest was eliminated in september as a result of our acquisition of the remaining minority interest in toc we did not already own 
therefore  there was no minority interest for the year ended december  net income loss net income loss for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the reasons stated above 
excluding the non cash  non recurring charge of  net of income tax benefit of  net income for the year ended december  would have been  or of revenue

advertising revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due  in part  to our improved ability to demonstrate the value of advertising on the outdoor channel to national advertisers 
nielsen reported that we had approximately million subscribers for the month of december compared to million for the month of december a decrease of million or 
nielsen revises this estimate each month and for march  nielsen reported that we had approximately million subscribers 
having nielsen ratings and demographic data enabled us to better utilize our inventory of available advertising time and increase our effective rates realized on our advertising time on the outdoor channel 
further  as demand for our air time increased  we negotiated higher fees from third party programmers that purchase advertising time in connection with the airing of their programs on the outdoor channel 
subscriber fees for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increased number of paying subscribers as we increased the number of service providers carrying the outdoor channel from approximately  at the end of to  at year end  contractual subscriber fee rate increases with existing service providers carrying the outdoor channel  the beginning of payments late in from certain carriers who had previously received the outdoor channel without charge  and the increasing penetration of the outdoor channel on existing distributors such as national cable television cooperative nctc  directv  comcast  dish network and charter 
membership income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in membership income was driven by increased attendance at our gold expositions and greater participation in our annual expedition to cripple river  alaska in compared to expenses expenses consist of the cost of satellite transmission fees  advertising and programming  compensation expense from the exchange of toc stock options  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
total expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  total expenses were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in expenses was due to several factors  but is principally driven by the non cash  non recurring compensation expense incurred by the issuance of options in connection with the toc merger with an intrinsic value of  in accordance with the terms of the acquisition by outdoor channel holdings of the remaining minority interest in toc it did not already own 
satellite transmission fees for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  this relatively static comparison reflects the substantially fixed nature of our contracts for these services and a negotiated price decrease in the contract 
advertising expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in advertising expense is principally a result of our increased spending on consumer and trade industry awareness campaigns to build demand for the outdoor channel 
advertising expenses are expected to increase as a percentage of revenue as we pursue our strategy to launch a second channel and to build awareness of our programming 
programming expense for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in programming expense is principally a result of our decision to produce more of our programming in house as opposed to selling the air time to third party producers 
our goal is to generate increased margin dollars by producing programming in house and retaining the advertising inventory 
our costs will increase as a result but we not only expect to generate more margin dollars but retain control of our programming for re purposing  quality control and other reasons 
compensation expense from the exchange of stock options for the year ended december  was  and was incurred as a result of the issuance of  options to toc option holders in accordance with the terms of the acquisition by outdoor channel holdings of all of the minority interest in toc it did not already own 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to the initiation of a program to provide digital receivers to a number of our carriers  increased personnel costs and other costs as further discussed below 
during  we made the decision to cease transmitting the outdoor channel as an analog signal in order to conserve bandwidth and further our transition to full digital transmission in preparation for the launch of outdoor channel hd 
to equip existing analog based service providers and to attract new service providers  we began providing service providers digital receivers which have the capability to output the signal in either a digital or analog format 
in  we spent approximately  on such receivers 
this receiver program was substantially completed in  however we expect to continue to provide newly launched service providers with such a receiver on an as needed basis 
personnel expenses increased approximately  in the year ended december  over principally as a result of additional hiring during as of december   we had employees as compared to at december  further  we experienced increases in other components of selling  general and administrative expenses professional fees and associated costs related to our reincorporation from alaska to delaware  listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  increased depreciation expense as a result of equipment purchased in and to support our growth  and our increased travel related costs associated with our increased advertising sales staff  support of our growing number of service providers and the promotion of the outdoor channel 
income loss from operations income loss from operations for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  compared to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  income loss from operations was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
if the effect of the non cash  non recurring compensation expense of  related to the assumption of toc stock options is excluded  income from operations for would have been  an increase of  or compared to income from operations for income from operations as adjusted for the non cash  non recurring expense of  grew at a slower pace than revenue during reflecting our investment in subscriber acquisition programs  increased in house programming and receivers for our service providers 
other income  net other income  net for the year ended december  was  an increase of  compared to  for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to the retirement of our debt to stockholders during  resulting in less interest expense complemented by the interest earned on increased cash balances 
income loss before income taxes and minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes and minority interest decreased significantly as a percentage of revenues to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the toc segment s income before income taxes and minority interest increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenue  the toc segment s income before income taxes and minority interest decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was due mainly to the implementation in of our digital receiver program  the growth of our advertising and programming expenses in the third quarter of  and increases in personnel expenses resulting from the increase in the average number of toc employees in compared to the membership division segment s income loss before income taxes and minority interest increased to  for the year ended december  from a loss of  for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of revenues  the membership division segment s income before income taxes and minority interest improved to for the year ended december  compared to a loss of for the year ended december  the increase principally reflects a concerted effort to control costs and make adjustments in our marketing and advertising that yielded increased sales  particularly as it relates to our expedition to cripple river  alaska  while spending less on selling  general and administrative expenses
