shape memory alloys are advanced materials which possess the ability to change their shape in response to thermal and mechanical changes  and the ability to return to their original shape following deformations from which conventional materials cannot recover 
specialty polymer extrusion products are complex  multi lumen  multi layer extrusions used for guidewires  catheter shafts  delivery systems and various other interventional medical procedures 
the company provides shape memory alloy products and services from facilities located in bethel  connecticut and menlo park  california and specialty polymer extrusion products and services from the putnam facility in dayville  connecticut 
memry processes raw material usually nitinol  an alloy of nickel and titanium  and plastic polymers into semi finished products such as wire  strip or nitinol and co extruded tube 
products in these forms are referred to as semi finished materials and are marketed directly  primarily to medical device companies  for use in products such as guidewires  endodontic files  stents  delivery systems  catheters and catheter shafts 
the company also further processes its semi finished materials into formed components and sub assemblies 
formed components are made by taking the semi finished material and further processing them by bending  kinking  coating  stamping  crimping  grinding  tipping  laser cutting  etc 
into specific forms specified by customers 
sub assemblies involve taking the semi finished materials or formed components produced by the company and combining or assembling them with other products that have been outsourced by memry to form a larger component or sub assembly required by an oem  usually in the medical device field 
examples are sub assemblies sold for use in endoscopic instruments and finished stent rings utilized in stent graft products 
the company believes that the medical device market for shape memory alloys and specialty polymer extrusion is growing 
early applications were for general surgical instruments and for various vascular procedures 
recently  new opportunities have appeared in orthopedic  urological  electrophysiology  and embolic protection devices 
approximately of the company s products and services are sold to medical device companies  with the balance being utilized in a variety of industrial and commercial applications 
the company sells primarily through a direct sales force  with sales representatives located in the us and europe 
the medical device industry has very strict quality requirements  and the ability to meet these requirements and the requested shipment schedules is a key determinant of success 
price competition has historically been a key competitive variable in products that are not technically difficult to manufacture  such as basic wire for use in applications such as cell phone antennas 
recently  as awareness of potential applications has increased and the industry has grown  the company has noted increased competition for tube products and sub assemblies  with commensurate pressure on prices and margins 

table of contents two key areas where management focuses its attention are to reduce the company s dependence on a small number of products procedures and to improve manufacturing efficiency 
through product development and acquisition  the company has expanded the number of products and customers over the past several years and reduced its dependence on a few key products  notably aaa stent graft components 
product and customer diversification continues to be a major strategic initiative for the company 
in addition to providing additional products and services through its core business operations  the company is continuing to explore diversification through acquisitions  such as putnam  joint ventures  and investments 
much of the variability in the company s margins over the past several years can be explained by variations in manufacturing efficiency due to product mix and volume 
in addition  the company has gained efficiencies through a constant process improvement process which has made manufacturing processes more efficient and improved product yields  thereby reducing material losses and improving margins

our significant policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation  are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

table of contents estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
on a regular basis  we review and evaluate the customers financial condition  which generally includes a review of the customers financial statements  trade references and past payment history with us 
we specifically evaluate identified customer risks that may be present and collateral requirements  if any  from the customer  which may include  among other things  deposits  prepayments or letters of credit 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we maintain inventory levels based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand or technological change can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in cost of goods sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates are primarily influenced by a sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn and technological changes 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value 
goodwill was  and  at june  and  respectively  an increase of  attributable to a subsequent purchase price adjustment for the putnam acquisition 
intangible assets consist primarily of management s estimates of developed technology  customer relationships  trade name  and other intangible assets that have been identified as a result of the appraisal process regarding the putnam acquisition 
these assets are being amortized over their useful life  determined to be to years  depending on asset class 
for further details of the acquisition  refer to the discussion of recent developments within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the acquired patents existing prior to the putnam acquisition are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life of years 
we review intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were  and  as of june  and  respectively 
all of the decrease is attributable to the amortization expense of  for the year ended june  stock based compensation 
we record compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  certain of our stock option grants are performance based 
on an ongoing basis  we review the actual and forecast results of the performance criteria to estimate the number of options that will become vested 
if actual results are different from our estimates  the number of options to be vested and the related expense recognized will require adjustment 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred taxes requires management to make estimates about the company s future profitability 
the estimates associated with the valuation of deferred taxes are considered critical due to the amount of deferred taxes recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining the company s future profitability 
deferred tax assets were  and  at june  and  respectively 
contingencies and litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued estimates of probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on our litigation exposure 

table of contents results of operations introduction in the past several years  the company has focused on increasing the amount of value added products it provides to the marketplace  ie  products where additional processing is performed on basic nitinol wire  strip  or tube before it is shipped to the customer 
currently  medical device applications represent some of the best opportunities for increasing the amount of value added business 
the kink resistant and self expanding properties of nitinol have made peripheral stenting an area of special interest  and stent components manufactured for abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa in particular have become a significant driver of the company s revenues 
however  because the market for stent components is very dynamic and rapidly changing  the company has found it difficult to accurately forecast demand for its stent components 
delays in product launches  uncertain timing on regulatory approvals  inventory adjustments by our customers  market share shifts between competing stent platforms  issues in raw material supply and quality and the introduction of next generation products have all contributed to the variability in revenue generated by shipments of medical stent components 
on november   the company completed the putnam acquisition 
putnam utilizes polymer extrusion technology to produce polymer based products sold primarily to the medical device industry 
the largest current application for putnam s technology is for catheters 
putnam also utilizes its extrusion capabilities for guidewires  delivery systems  and various other interventional medical devices 
as in the nitinol product line of the company  putnam is focusing on growing the value added portion of its business by performing additional processing on its semi finished polymer tube 
the large majority of putnam s products are sold directly to the medical device industry through the company s direct sales organization 
the results of operations of putnam have been included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
business segments the company s product lines consist of shape memory alloys smas and specialty polymer extrusion products 
currently  the predominant sma utilized by the company is a nickel titanium alloy commonly referred to as nitinol 
prior to the company s november  putnam acquisition  the company only produced smas 
both product lines provide design  engineering  development and manufacturing services to the medical device and other industries using the company s proprietary shape memory alloy and polymer extrusion technologies 
medical device products include stent components  catheter components  guidewires  laparoscopic surgical sub assemblies and orthopedic instruments 
during the quarter ended december   the company revised management responsibilities and made changes to its sales organization and employee bonus program as it began managing its business as two business segments i nitinol products segment  and ii polymer products segment 
prior to that time  the company had operated as one business segment 
all years reflect the results based on these two business segments 
the nitinol products segment provides design support  manufactures and markets advanced materials which possess the ability to change their shape in response to thermal and mechanical changes  and the ability to return to their original shape following deformations from which conventional materials cannot recover 
the nitinol products segment s products are used in applications for stent components  filters  embolic protection devices  guidewires  catheters  surgical instruments and devices  orthopedic devices  orthodontic apparatus  cellular telephone antennae  high pressure sealing devices  fasteners  and other devices 
the polymer products segment designs  manufactures and markets specialty polymer extrusion products to companies serving the medical device  laser  fiber optic  automotive and industrial markets 
its primary products are complex  multi lumen  multi layer extrusions used for guidewires  catheter shafts  delivery systems and various other interventional medical procedures 
the polymer products segment s products are known for their complex configurations  multiple material construction and innovative designs  all while maintaining tight tolerances 
included in the line item eliminations below are the eliminations between the two segments 

table of contents year ended june   compared to year ended june  the following table compares revenues and gross margin by business segment for the years ended june  and year ended june  increase decrease of revenues of revenues revenues nitinol products segment polymer products segment eliminations total gross profit nitinol products segment polymer products segment total the following table sets forth the company s condensed consolidated statements of income for the year ended june  and year ended june  increase decrease of revenues of revenues revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development general  selling and administration  including separation charges of  in amortization of intangible assets operating income loss on extinguishment of debt other income interest expense income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues 
revenues increased to  in the year ended june  from  during the same period in fiscal  an increase of  the increase in revenues was due principally to the inclusion of revenues from the polymer products segment for a full year in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of putnam on november  the polymer products segment s revenue for the year ended june  was  as compared to  during fiscal  which represents both growth in the business and the fact that the putnam acquisition did not occur until the middle of the second quarter of fiscal the growth in the business was primarily due 
table of contents to increased shipments of guidewires to a major customer  although shipments of catheters to other customers and for other applications also grew during fiscal additionally  sales of the polymer products segment increased to of total revenues in the year ended june  from in the year ended june  revenues for the nitinol products segment increased slightly to  in the year ended june  from  during fiscal the revenue increase in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  was primarily due to increased shipments of components utilized in general surgical applications of approximately  increased revenues of approximately  in superelastic tube  increased revenues from prototype development and research and development activities of approximately  and shipments of high pressure sealing plugs  which increased approximately  for the year ended june  compared with the similar period in fiscal offsetting these increases were decreased shipments of nitinol laser cut tube based and wire based stent components  sold to the company s largest customer  which declined approximately  the decrease in the tube based stent components was due to an overall decline in the sales of the customer s product and the loss of a portion of the customer s business to a second source 
the decrease in the wire based stent components was caused primarily by shortages in acceptable raw material from one of the company s suppliers related to this product line that occurred during the first quarter and which were subsequently addressed  as well as competitive pressures 
looking forward to fiscal  the company anticipates that overall nitinol stent component revenues for fiscal will experience some decline from their revenues in fiscal the reason for this decline relates primarily to an anticipated reduction in shipments of tube based stent components to our largest customer because of a potential reduction of the customer s shipments and the customer s desire for a second source 
additionally  the nitinol products segment had lower sales in the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  for arch wire of approximately  and microcoil and guidewire products  which decreased approximately  costs and expenses 
cost of revenues increased  or  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of putnam s results of operations for twelve months in fiscal  as compared to less than eight months in fiscal putnam recorded cost of revenues of  the nitinol products segment operated at a slightly lower gross margin in the year ended june  than in fiscal primarily due to a shift in the product mix of shipments towards those products with higher per unit direct production costs in the area of general surgical applications 
the polymer products segment s gross margin continues to be higher than the gross margin of the nitinol products segment 
the polymer products segment s gross margin increased slightly to of revenues in the year ended june  from in the year ended june  as the segment benefited from increased production volumes 
since the november acquisition of putnam  the company has invested in personnel and equipment to provide capacity to support the increased business of the polymer products segment 
the company experienced price pressure on several product lines and  during the year ended june   it continued to incur additional expense associated with the launch of a new guidewire product 
in addition  stock based compensation of  was charged to cost of revenues for the year ended june  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as a result of these factors  consolidated gross profit decreased from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  see the information in the table in the beginning of the section for information on the results of the business segments 
the company s ability to maintain or grow its gross profit margin is dependent on several factors 
one is the product mix of the company s shipments  which can be affected by customer requirements  capacity of specific product lines and general timing 
another is the success of the company in securing sufficient business to absorb plant overhead  particularly high margin nitinol tube business 
in fiscal  an anticipated reduction in shipments of tube based stent components will make it difficult to maintain gross margins in the nitinol products segment 
the company continues to invest in the manufacturing operations at its polymer products segment  including staff  equipment  and systems to grow the segment s revenues over the next several years 
these investments are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may have the effect of reducing profitability  particularly in the short term  at its polymer products segment 
operating expenses  including research and development costs  general  selling and administration expenses and amortization of intangible assets increased  or  to  in the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  the increase in operating expenses in the year ended june  was primarily as a result of the inclusion of putnam s results of operations for a full twelve months in fiscal  as compared to less than eight months in fiscal additionally  the operating expenses increased due to the  separation charges related to the retirement of the company s chief executive officer  the addition of engineering  administration and sales and marketing personnel  a full year s amortization of intangible assets related to the putnam acquisition and marketing program initiatives undertaken in the year ended june  further cost increases were also driven by the company adopting sfas no 
r in the year ended june  and the related stock based compensation charged to operating 
table of contents expense of  the continuing increase in administration costs related to legal and accounting activities and higher personnel costs 
total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  excluding the separation charges  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in the year ended june  the company expects operating expenses to increase in fiscal as the company undertakes implementation of rule compliance requirements 
nonoperating income and expenses 
loss on extinguishment of debt of  in fiscal year was due to the write off of deferred financing costs of  and a penalty on the prepayment of subordinated debt of  the company prepaid million of its subordinated debt in order to reduce interest expense in future periods 
other income increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the prior year 
other income includes primarily royalty income and gains on fixed asset disposals 
net interest expense was  in the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june  the change from year to year was due principally to an increase in interest expense  including the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with a higher level of borrowings utilized to finance a portion of the putnam acquisition  and higher overall borrowing costs due to an increase in libor from the year ended june  to the year ended june  income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended june   compared to a provision of  for the year ended june  the decrease in the provision is the result of lower income before taxes and the recognition of an extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit related to export sales in the year ended june  offsetting a portion of the decrease in the income tax provision was the exclusion of the deduction for the recording of the stock based compensation relating to incentive stock options isos in the year ended june  the company may recognize some income tax benefit in the future related to compensation expenses on isos 
the amount of income tax benefit recognized will be contingent upon the amount of options exercised  whether the exercise is a disqualifying disposition and the statutory income tax rate at the time of exercise  among other factors 
the effective tax rate was for the years ended june  and net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the company s net income decreased by  to  in the year ended june  compared to  for fiscal year ended june   compared to year ended june  the following table compares revenues and gross margin by business segment for the years ended june  and year ended june  increase decrease of revenues of revenues revenues nitinol products segment polymer products segment   n a eliminations   n a total gross profit nitinol products segment polymer products segment   n a total

revenues increased to  during the year ended june  compared to  during fiscal year  an increase of  most of the increase is due to the inclusion of revenues generated in the polymer products segment as a result of the acquisition of putnam on november  the polymer products segment s revenue for the year ended june  was  of total revenues in the year 
another major contributor to the increase in revenues was shipments of nitinol wire based stent components which increased approximately  during the year ended june  compared to fiscal year shipments of nitinol tube based stent components increased approximately  over the same period 
also contributing to the increase in revenues in fiscal were higher shipments of arch wire products which increased approximately  microcoil and guidewire products which increased approximately  and tinel lock  which increased approximately  shipments of components utilized in general surgical applications increased approximately  fiscal over fiscal additionally  revenue from prototype development  and research and development activities increased approximately  excluding putnam s revenue during the period from november  to june  for similar activities of an additional 
the company believes that the increase in revenue from prototype development and research and development activities is an indication that its efforts to fill the pipeline with new product development opportunities is having some success 
offsetting these increases was an approximately  decline in revenue from superelastic tube resulting primarily from what the company believes are inventory adjustments at a major tube customer  price discounts  and customer loss of market share 
shipments of high pressure sealing plugs decreased approximately  in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year costs and expenses 
cost of revenues increased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of two factors 
first  there was a shift in focus of staff engineers at memry s nitinol operations from new process development and prototype support  which is an operating expense  to manufacturing support  which is a manufacturing expense 
in addition  the  of revenues from november  to june  due to the putnam acquisition had a cost of revenues of  
table of contents as a result of these factors  the company s gross profit declined slightly from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  operating expenses  including research and development costs  general  selling and administration expenses and amortization of intangible assets increased  or  to  during fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the dollar increase reflects the addition of administrative and sales and marketing personnel and programs associated with the putnam acquisition and amortization of related intangible assets of  in addition  the company increased its investment in sales and marketing through additional spending on advertising  trade shows  and marketing literature 
the company also incurred higher personnel costs  including bonuses of  and increased consultants fees in conjunction with the evaluation of the sarbanes oxley act of section offsetting these increases  the shift in focus of staff engineers at the company s nitinol operations from new process development and prototype support  which is an operating expense  to manufacturing support  which is a manufacturing expense  had the effect of reducing operating expenses 
the decrease of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal year to in fiscal year was primarily a net result of the above factors and the increase in revenues in fiscal over fiscal nonoperating income and expenses 
loss on extinguishment of debt of  in fiscal year was due to the write off of deferred financing costs of  and the penalty on the prepayment of subordinated debt of  the company prepaid million of the subordinated debt in order to reduce interest expense in future periods 
net interest expense was  for fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal the change from year to year was due principally to an increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with a higher level of borrowing utilized to finance a portion of the putnam acquisition 
income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended june   compared to a provision of  for the year ended june  the increase in provision is the result of an increase in the company s pretax income in fiscal and the recording of state research and development r d tax credits of  in fiscal before the r d tax credits in fiscal  the effective income tax rates were in fiscal year and in fiscal year net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the company s net income increased by  to  for the fiscal year compared to net income of  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources at june   the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was  an increase of  from  at the start of fiscal this increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to cash provided by operations and the permanent waiver by webster business credit corporation of the  cash collateral deposit requirements  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operations was  for the year ended june   a decrease of  from  provided during fiscal this decrease was due principally to an increase in accounts receivable due to customers extending payments  which were partially offset by non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and equity based compensation during the year ended june  net cash used in investing activities decreased  to  for the year ended june  compared to  during fiscal this decrease is primarily related to the  used for the putnam acquisition in the year ended june  additionally  in the year ended june   the company made  cash collateral deposits as part of its credit facility 
in fiscal  the primary capital requirement was to fund additions to property  plant and equipment  primarily the purchases of previously leased and new lasers for cutting nitinol tube at the company s menlo park  california facility of  and a scanning electron microscope in the bethel  connecticut facility of  additionally  in the year ended june   the company made payments of  in connection with the purchase of putnam 
during fiscal  the company s principal lender permanently waived the requirement for the cash collateral deposits and the  has been classified as cash at june  during the year ended june   net cash used in financing activities was  which includes the  installment on the deferred payment for the putnam acquisition and the pay down of the note payable to webster business credit corporation of  offset by the proceeds from notes payable of  and the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and warrants for  
table of contents working capital at june  was  an increase of  from  at june  the increase in working capital is a result of the permanent waiver of the cash collateral deposits and the net cash from operations  which together exceeded the capital expenditures and principal payments on notes payable for fiscal in fiscal  the primary capital requirements were to fund the putnam acquisition  capital expenditures and the investment in biomer technology limited 
in the year ended june   the primary capital requirement was to fund capital expenditures and principal payments on notes payable 
in connection with the putnam acquisition on november   the company entered into a credit and security agreement with webster business credit corporation the webster agreement which replaced the existing credit facility with webster bank 
the webster agreement includes a term loan facility consisting of a five year term loan of million the five year term and a three year term loan of million the three year term  together with the five year term known as the term loan facility 
both term loans are repayable in equal monthly installments with the additional requirement that  under the three year term  a prepayment of of excess cash flow  as defined  be made annually within days of the company s fiscal year end 
the excess cash flow prepayment requirement was waived by webster business credit corporation for fiscal and  but remains in effect for the remaining years of the loan term 
interest under the five year term is based upon  at the company s option  libor plus or the alternate base rate  as defined  plus 
interest under the three year term is based upon  at the company s option  libor plus or the alternate base rate  as defined  plus 
borrowings under the term loan facility were used to repay approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the existing facility with webster bank and to partially fund the putnam acquisition 
the webster agreement also provides for a revolving line of credit for borrowings up to the lesser of a  or b an amount equal to the aggregate of of the eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of  or of eligible inventories 
interest under the revolving line of credit is based upon  at the company s option  libor plus or the alternate base rate  as defined 
the entire outstanding principal amount of the revolving line of credit is due november  as of june   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
additionally  the webster agreement includes an equipment line of credit that provides for equipment financing up to the lesser of  or of the hard cost for eligible equipment through november  on the same financing terms as the five year term 
as of november    of outstanding amount under the equipment line was converted to a term loan  payable monthly  based on a seven year amortization schedule  but with a balloon payment of the then unpaid balance due november  on december   the webster agreement was amended to provide an equipment line of credit that provides for equipment financing up to the lesser of  or of the hard cost for eligible equipment through november  on the same financing terms as the five year term 
borrowings under the webster agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the webster agreement contains various restrictive covenants  including  among others  the limitation of mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  limitations on encumbrances and additional debt  limitations on the payment of dividends or redemption of stock and compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio  as defined 
additionally  the company was required to maintain cash as collateral security until the three year term loan was paid in full 
for the first year of the webster agreement  the collateral deposit requirement was  this amount had been classified as cash collateral deposits on the consolidated balance sheet as of june  on november   webster business credit corporation permanently waived the company s cash collateral deposit requirements  and these funds have been accounted for as cash and cash equivalents 
additional financing for the putnam acquisition was obtained on november  from brookside pecks capital partners  lp and ironbridge mezzanine fund  lp in the form of a million subordinated loan due november  the subordinated loan 
the interest rate on the subordinated loan is  of which is payable quarterly with the remaining payable in additional promissory notes having identical terms as the subordinated loan 
originally  the interest rate was  with payable in additional promissory notes  but was reduced because the company achieved certain pretax income thresholds in fiscal in future years  the interest rate is subject to similar reductions by reaching pretax thresholds and subject to increase in the event of default 
the subordinated loan contains various restrictive covenants including  among others  the limitation of mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  limitations on encumbrances and additional debt  limitations on the payment of dividends or redemption of stock and compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio  as defined
