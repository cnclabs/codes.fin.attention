item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
general we currently operate institutes in states  which were providing postsecondary education to more than  students as of december  we derive our revenue almost entirely from the cost of tuition  tool kits  laptop computers and fees charged to and paid by  or on behalf of  our students 
most students at our institutes pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses with funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially title iv programs 
in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenue  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the ed s regulations  from title iv programs 
our revenue varies based on the aggregate student population  which is influenced by the following factors the number of students attending our institutes at the beginning of a fiscal period  the number of new first time students entering and former students re entering our institutes during a fiscal period  student retention rates  and general economic conditions 
new students generally enter our institutes at the beginning of an academic quarter that begins for most programs of study in early march  mid june  early september or late november 
our establishment of new institutes and the introduction of additional program offerings at our existing institutes have been significant factors in increasing the aggregate student population in recent years 
in order to participate in title iv programs  a new institute must be authorized by the state in which it will operate  accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ed  and certified by the ed to participate in title iv programs 
the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes grants accreditation to a new institute prior to its first class start date 
the ed s certification process cannot commence until the institute receives its state authorization and accreditation 
in the last few years  we have experienced minimal delay in obtaining ed certification of our new institutes and learning sites 
we earn tuition revenue on a straight line basis over the length of each of four  week academic quarters in each fiscal year 
state regulations  accrediting commission criteria and our policies generally require us to refund a portion of the tuition and fee payments received from a student who withdraws from one of our institutes during an academic quarter 
we recognize immediately the amount of tuition and fees  if any  that we may retain after payment of any refund 
we incur expenses throughout a fiscal period in connection with the operation of our institutes 
the cost of educational services includes faculty and administrative salaries  cost of course materials  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment costs  facilities and leasehold improvements  and other miscellaneous costs incurred by our institutes 
student services and administrative expenses include direct marketing costs which are marketing expenses directly related to new student recruitment  indirect marketing expenses  an allowance for doubtful accounts and administrative expenses incurred at our corporate headquarters 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits for recruiting representatives and direct solicitation expenses 
we capitalize our direct marketing costs 
table of contents excluding advertising expenses using the successful efforts method and amortize them on a cost pool by cost pool basis over the period that we expect to receive revenue streams associated with those assets 
we expense as incurred our marketing costs that do not relate to the direct solicitation of potential students 
in  we developed three new residence bachelor degree programs  six new online bachelor degree programs or new concentrations within existing online bachelor degree programs  one new residence associate degree program  and one new online associate degree program 
in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we also expanded the use of the hybrid delivery model to institutes in in  we developed two new residence bachelor degree programs  two new online bachelor degree programs  three new residence associate degree programs  and three new online associate degree programs 
in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we also expanded the use of the hybrid delivery model to institutes in in  we developed three new residence bachelor degree programs  three new residence associate degree programs  and one new online master degree program 
in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we also expanded to several additional institutes in the use of the hybrid delivery model 
we opened four new institutes and three learning sites in  two new institutes and one learning site in and three new institutes in we also closed two institutes in we plan to open up to a combined total of new institutes and learning sites in our new institutes have historically incurred a loss during the month period after the first class start date 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
we include all property and equipment in the financial statements at cost and make provisions for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight line method 
the following table sets forth the general ranges of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment type of property and equipment useful lives furniture and equipment to years leasehold and building improvements to years buildings to years software to years 
table of contents changes in circumstances  such as changes in our curricula and technological advances  may result in the actual useful lives of our property  equipment and software differing from our estimates 
we regularly review and evaluate the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment and software 
although we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from our assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
recognition of revenue 
tuition revenue is recorded on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable course 
if a student withdraws from an institute  the standards of most state education authorities that regulate our institutes  the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes and our own internal policy limit a student s obligation for tuition and fees to the institute depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter refund policies 
the terms of the refund policies vary by state  and the limitations imposed by the refund policies are generally based on the portion of the academic quarter that has elapsed at the time the student withdraws 
the greater the portion of the academic quarter that has elapsed at the time the student withdraws  the greater the student s obligation is to the institute for the tuition and fees related to that academic quarter 
we record revenue net of any refunds that result from any applicable refund policy 
on an individual student basis  tuition earned in excess of cash received is recorded as accounts receivable  and cash received in excess of tuition earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
the cost of textbooks is included in the tuition and is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable course length and the deferral of textbook costs is recorded in prepaids and other current assets 
laptop computer sales and the related cost of the laptop computers are recognized when the students receive the laptop computers 
tool kit sales and the related cost of the tool kits are recognized at the beginning of each academic quarter 
academic fees which are charged only one time to students on their first day of class attendance and admission processing fees which  prior to their discontinuance in  were charged only one time to students upon being evaluated for admission to their programs of study are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the average program length 
deferred revenue is recorded for fees collected in excess of revenue recognized 
if a student withdraws from an institute  all unrecognized revenue relating to his or her fees  net of any refunds that result from any applicable refund policy  is recognized upon the student s departure 
administrative fees  which are charged to students when they withdraw or graduate from their programs of study at an institute  are recognized when the students withdraw or graduate from their programs of study at the institute 
in the year ended december   approximately of our revenue represented tuition charges and approximately of our revenue represented laptop computer sales  tool kit sales and student fees 
in the years ended december  and  approximately of our revenue represented tuition charges and approximately of our revenue represented tool kit sales and student fees 
the amount of tuition earned depends on the cost per credit hour of the courses in the program  the number of courses in the program  how long a student remains enrolled in the program  how many program courses a student takes during each period of enrollment in the program  and the total number of students enrolled in each program 
each of these factors is known at the time our tuition revenue is calculated and is not subject to estimation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an account receivable for the tuition earned in excess of the payment received from or on behalf of a student for that tuition 
the individual student balances of these receivables are insignificant 
we extend unsecured credit for tuition and fees to our students 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable on an institute by institute basis  using the institute s historical collection experience 
our management reviews the historical collection experience for each institute  considers other facts and circumstances related to an institute and adjusts the calculation to record an allowance for doubtful accounts as appropriate 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable 
if our current collection trends were to differ significantly from our historic collection experience  however  we would make a corresponding adjustment to our allowance 
we write off the accounts receivable owed by former students after three months of unsuccessful collection efforts 

table of contents direct marketing costs 
direct costs incurred relating to the enrollment of new students are capitalized using the successful efforts method 
direct marketing costs subject to capitalization include salaries and employee benefits of recruiting representatives and other direct costs less admission processing fees  if any 
successful efforts is the ratio of students enrolled to prospective students interviewed 
the higher the rate of interviewed students who enroll  the greater the percentage of our direct marketing costs that are capitalized 
we amortize our direct marketing costs on a cost pool by cost pool basis over the period that we expect to receive revenue streams associated with those assets 
the direct costs subject to capitalization are readily quantifiable and are not subject to estimation 
the amortization method is based on historical trends of student enrollment and retention activity and is not subject to significant assumptions 
we regularly evaluate both the future recoverability of these deferred costs and the factors used to determine the amounts to be deferred and amortized 
contingent liabilities 
we are subject to various claims and contingencies in the ordinary course of our business  including those related to litigation  business transactions  employee related matters and taxes  among others 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
the liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs associated with the claim or potential claim 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  deviations from our estimates could produce a materially different result 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  which provides guidance regarding the application of sfas no 
r 
under this accounting treatment  all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  must be reflected in the financial statements using the fair value method with the related expenses recognized over the service period 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective application without restating prior periods  which requires that we recognize compensation expense for all stock option and other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable on and after january  prior to  we accounted for share based compensation to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
under the intrinsic value method  no compensation cost for employee or director stock options is recognized in the financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  because it will require us to expense future compensation costs for stock options awarded to our employees and directors 
all of those compensation expenses  however  will be non cash and should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flows 
for periods on and after january   the impact of sfas no 
r will depend on the amount of share based compensation paid to our employees and directors 
if we had adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the compensation expense recognized would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  instead of a cash flow from operating activities as required prior to this new requirement will reduce net cash flows from operating activities and increase net cash flows from financing activities by a corresponding amount beginning in on october   the compensation committee of our board of directors accelerated the vesting of certain unvested  out of the money stock options to purchase shares of our common stock that had exercise prices greater than  the closing price of our common stock on october  the vesting was accelerated for nonqualified stock options representing approximately  shares of our common stock  which included all unvested  out of the money stock options issued and outstanding under the itt educational services  inc incentive stock plan the stock plan and the outside directors stock option plan 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  all of those stock options were fully exercisable as of october  and will remain exercisable through their expiration or termination dates  which vary  but do not extend past the purpose for accelerating the vesting of those stock options was to reduce our future compensation costs associated with those stock options upon our adoption of sfas no 
r in we estimate that the accelerated vesting of those stock options will reduce our compensation costs  net of tax  by approximately million in  million in and million in 
table of contents on october   the compensation committee of our board of directors awarded certain of our executives nonqualified stock options under the stock plan to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock as of november  the stock options awarded were fully vested and immediately exercisable 
the full vesting of the stock options was conditioned upon each optionee agreeing not to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares obtained upon exercising the option until a the first anniversary with respect to one third of the shares underlying the option  b the second anniversary with respect to an additional one third of the shares underlying the option and c the third anniversary with respect to the remaining one third of the shares underlying the option 
the purpose for accelerating the award and vesting of those stock options was to reduce our future compensation costs associated with those stock options upon our adoption of sfas no 
r in we estimate the accelerated award and vesting of those stock options will reduce our compensation costs  net of tax  by approximately million in  million in and million in in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  that replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
under this new standard  voluntary changes in accounting principles must be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented 
sfas no 
also requires that any change in the method of depreciation  amortization or depletion for long lived non financial assets be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate  and corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements be termed a restatement 
sfas no 
is effective for changes in accounting principles and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
variations in quarterly results of operations our quarterly results of operations have tended to fluctuate within a fiscal year due to the timing of student matriculations 
each of our four fiscal quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue 
revenue in our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally benefits from increased student matriculations 
the number of new students entering our institutes tends to be substantially higher in june of all new students in and september of all new students in because of the significant number of recent high school graduates entering our institutes for the academic quarters beginning in those two months 
the academic schedule generally does not affect our incurrence of most of our costs  however  and costs do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth our revenue for the periods indicated quarterly revenue dollars in thousands three months ended amount percent amount percent amount percent march june september december total for year results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain statement of income data to revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue cost of educational services student services and administrative expenses special legal and other investigation costs operating income interest income  net income before income taxes 
table of contents the following table sets forth our total student enrollment as of the dates indicated as of december  total student enrollment increase over prior year the total student enrollment numbers exclude international enrollments and enrollments at two institutes that ceased operations at the end of the following table sets forth total new student enrollment for the periods indicated for the year ended december  total new student enrollment increase over prior year the total new student enrollment numbers exclude international enrollments and enrollments at two institutes that ceased operations at the end of we generally organize the academic schedule for programs of study offered at our institutes on the basis of four week academic quarters in a calendar year that typically begin in early march  mid june  early september and late november 
to measure the persistence of our students  the number of continuing students in any academic quarter is divided by the total student enrollment as of the end of the immediately preceding academic quarter 
a continuing student is any student who  in any academic quarter  is enrolled in a program of study at an itt technical institute and was enrolled in the same program at any itt technical institute at the end of the immediately preceding academic quarter 
total student enrollment includes all new and continuing students enrolled at our itt technical institutes at the end of an academic quarter 
the following table sets forth the rates of our students persistence for the periods indicated student persistence for the three months ended year march june september december international enrollments and enrollments at two institutes that ceased operations at the end of are excluded from the calculation of our student persistence rate 
beginning in the second quarter of  we began using the hybrid delivery model with a larger number of our students  which increased the number of courses that we teach online over the internet to our students 
student 
table of contents retention is typically lower in the courses that we teach online over the internet compared to the courses that we teach on campus 
as a result of the expanded use of the hybrid delivery model  our student persistence rate decreased 
we believe that the student persistence rate will continue to decrease until the use of the hybrid delivery model is fully implemented at our institutes  at which point we expect the rate to stabilize 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  a increase in the total student enrollment at december  compared to december   and a increase in new student enrollment at our institutes in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily the result of the opening of new institutes  an increased number of institutes offering bachelor degree programs  an increased number of new programs of study offered by our institutes  the availability of private student loans to supplement federal student financial aid  and the expanded use of the hybrid delivery model 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in our student persistence rate in the year ended december  cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  and increased costs due to opening new institutes two opened in december  one opened in june  one opened in september and two opened in december and new learning sites one opened in september  two opened in june and one opened in september 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in  primarily due to continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  certain fixed costs at our institutes that did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenue resulting from increased student enrollment and tuition rate increases  and new and renegotiated vendor contracts 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  student services and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in compared to of revenue in  primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense from of revenue to of revenue  partially offset by an increase in the amount of marketing costs deferred as a result of an increase in new student enrollment as a percentage of the number of applicants interviewed 
the decrease in student services and administrative expense was partially offset by a increase in media advertising expense related to the promotion of new program offerings and new institute locations 
special legal and other investigation costs decreased million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease had a material favorable effect on our results of operations 
the primary causes of this decrease were the favorable developments in the doj investigation of us  the inquiry initiated by the sec into the allegations investigated by the doj  and the securities class action  shareholder derivative and books and records inspection lawsuits filed against us  certain of our current and former executive officers and each of our directors collectively  the actions in the year ended december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents operating income increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the operating margin increased to of revenue in from in  primarily due to a million reduction in special legal and other investigation costs  which represented a increase in the operating margin  continued facility and faculty utilization efficiencies  new and renegotiated vendor contracts  and certain fixed costs at our institutes that did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenue resulting from increased student enrollment and tuition rate increases 
interest income increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in our cash and investments coupled with a rising rate of return on our investments 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december   primarily due to our investing in tax exempt and tax advantaged investments  a favorable prior year provision to tax return reconciliation  and the implementation of certain state tax strategies involving eight states 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  a increase in the total student enrollment at december  compared to december   and a increase in new student enrollment at our institutes in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  which was primarily the result of the opening of new institutes  an increased number of institutes offering bachelor degree programs  an increased number of new programs of study offered by our institutes  an increased number of responses to our marketing and advertising  operational changes that increased the percentage of new student enrollments arising from those responses  the availability of private student loans to supplement federal student financial aid  and the use of the hybrid delivery model at more institutes 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in our student persistence rate in the year ended december  cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  increased costs due to opening new institutes one opened in march  one opened in june  one opened in december  and two opened in december  and increased costs associated with implementing the hybrid delivery model at more institutes

liquidity and capital resources on a cash accounting basis  as defined by the ed s regulations  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenue from title iv programs in compared to in and in federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year  which consists of three academic quarters 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in three disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received either days after in the case of students commencing a program of study or ten days before the start of the first academic quarter of a student s academic year  and the second and third disbursements are typically received ten days before the start of each subsequent quarter of a student s academic year 
while the timing of loan disbursements to us is subject to a student s directions to the lender and to existing regulatory requirements regarding such disbursements  we typically receive student loan funds upon the lender s disbursement of those funds 
our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with rule b of the exchange act 
the following table sets forth the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock during  and year ended december  number of shares repurchased total cost of shares repurchased in millions average cost per share 
table of contents as of december   our existing repurchase authorization permitted us to repurchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
from february  through february   we repurchased  outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to our existing repurchase authorization at a total cost of million or at an average cost per share of 
we may elect to repurchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future  depending on market conditions and other considerations 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help us achieve our long term goal of enhancing shareholder value 
our principal uses of cash are to pay salaries  occupancy and equipment costs  recruiting and marketing expenses  administrative expenses and taxes  including start up costs for new institutes and learning sites 
from time to time  we also use cash to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to our board of directors authorizations and in accordance with rule b of the exchange act 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations for the past five years 
cash flows from operations in were million  an increase of million from million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and investments ranged from a low of million in february to a high of million in november as of december   we had million of investments that we plan to hold until maturity 
the maturity dates extend beyond one year for million of those held to maturity investments 
as of december   we had million of investments in auction rate debt securities  variable rate demand notes and auction rate preferred equity securities that were available for sale 
although the contractual maturity dates for some of our auction rate debt securities and variable rate demand notes extend beyond ten years  we have the ability to quickly liquidate those investments and we do not intend to hold those investments until they mature 
as of december   restricted cash arising from our use of the ed s electronic funds transfer system as part of our participation in the title iv programs was compared to million as of december  all title iv program funds transferred to us through the ed s electronic funds transfer system are subject to certain disbursement restrictions that must be satisfied before we can apply those funds to our students accounts 
the disbursement restrictions for funds to be applied to the accounts of our first time students prohibit any disbursement until days following the start of the academic term and require us to apply any funds we receive on behalf of our students to their accounts within three days of receipt first time disbursement restrictions 
in some of our fiscal years  the last academic quarter at our institutes does not begin in time for us to satisfy the first time disbursement restrictions before the end of the fiscal year 
in  we were able to satisfy the first time disbursement restrictions associated with the last academic quarter before the end of the fiscal year  resulting in no restricted cash as of december  in  we were unable to satisfy the first time disbursement restrictions associated with the last academic quarter until after the end of the fiscal year  resulting in million of restricted cash as of december  we have investments in marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities  which are classified as available for sale or held to maturity  depending on our investment intentions with regard to those securities 
marketable debt securities classified as available for sale securities that have remaining contractual maturity dates in excess of days at the time of purchase are recorded at their market value 
marketable debt securities classified as held to maturity securities are recorded at their amortized cost as we have the intent and ability to hold those investments until they mature 
auction rate preferred equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded at their market value 
investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as non current investments 
on december   we had positive working capital of million 
deferred revenue  which represents the cash received from students in excess of tuition earned  increased million to million on december  from million on december  this increase was primarily due to increased tuition revenue resulting from higher tuition rates and increased enrollment 
we perform an actuarial valuation annually of the esi pension plan  a non contributory defined benefit pension plan  and the esi excess pension plan  a nonqualified  unfunded retirement plan the pension plans 
we review and update our key assumptions as part of each valuation  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on the investments in each pension plan 
the benefit accruals under the pension plans for all participants in those plans will be frozen effective march   such that no further benefits will accrue under the pension plans after march  participants in the pension plans will  however  continue to be credited with vesting service and interest according to the terms of the pension plans 
as a result of the freeze  the unrecognized net actuarial loss associated with the pension plans will 
table of contents decrease approximately million due to the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation 
we will continue to amortize over future periods the remaining unrecognized net actuarial loss of approximately million associated with the pension plans 
the unrecognized prior service costs associated with the pension plans are less than million and will not have a significant adverse effect on our financial statements 
we contributed million to the esi pension plan in january  which we believe approximates our current funding obligations under that plan 
this contribution will not have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in during  we increased our minimum pension liability by million as a result of obtaining an investment return on plan assets less than our original estimate  a decrease in our discount rate  and refinements made to our future expected benefit payment assumptions 
we also recorded a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which was net of a million deferred tax asset 
during  we increased our minimum pension liability by million as a result of obtaining an investment return on plan assets less than our original estimate  and a decrease in our discount rate 
we also recorded a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which was net of a million deferred tax asset 
during  we reduced our minimum pension liability with respect to our obligations under the esi pension plan by million as a result of obtaining an investment return on plan assets in excess of our original estimates  and we recorded a corresponding million increase in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
under the hea  an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs  if the rates at which the institution s students default on their federal student loans exceed specified percentages 
an institution whose ffel fdl cohort default rate is a or greater for three consecutive federal fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in the ffel  fdl and pell programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the ed determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years  or b greater than for one federal fiscal year loses eligibility to participate in the ffel and fdl programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the ed determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years 
if any of our campus groups lost its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and we could not arrange for alternative financing sources on similar terms for the students and their parents attending an institute in that campus group  the students ability to finance their education would be adversely affected  our receivables would increase and the number of students attending that campus group would probably decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table sets forth the range of our campus groups ffel fdl cohort default rates for the federal fiscal years indicated federal fiscal year ffel fdl cohort default rate range a to b to to to a the most recent year for which the ed has published ffel fdl preliminary cohort default rates 
b the most recent year for which the ed has published ffel fdl official cohort default rates 
if an institution s ffel fdl cohort default rate is or greater in any of the three most recent federal fiscal years  or if its cohort default rate for loans under the perkins program exceeds for any federal award year  the ed may place that institution on provisional certification status 
the ed may revoke an institution s provisional certification without advance notice  if the ed determines that the institution is not fulfilling all material requirements 
the ed may also more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified  if it applies for approval to open a new location or makes some other significant change affecting its eligibility 
provisional certification does not otherwise limit an institution s access to title iv program funds 
provisional certification of our institutes has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  and we do not believe that it will in the future 

table of contents the standards of most of the state education authorities that regulate our institutes and the acics that accredits our institutes limit how much of a student s tuition and fees an institution can retain for a student who withdraws from the institution 
the hea and its implementing regulations impose limits on the amount of title iv program funds withdrawing students can use to pay their education costs return policy 
the return policy permits a student to use only a pro rata portion of the title iv program funds that the student would otherwise be eligible to use  if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment 
the institution must return to the appropriate lenders or the ed any title iv program funds that the institution receives on behalf of a withdrawing student in excess of the amount the student can use for such period of enrollment 
depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter  the return policy can reduce the amount of title iv program funds that the withdrawing student can use to pay his or her education costs owed to the itt technical institute 
in these instances  withdrawing students may be unable to pay all of their education costs that would have been paid by the title iv program funds that were returned and we may be unable to collect a significant portion of those costs 
our students use of supplemental private loans has improved our collection of the students education costs 
under a provision of the hea commonly referred to as the rule  a for profit institution  such as each of our campus groups  becomes ineligible to participate in title iv programs if  on a cash accounting basis  the institution derives more than of its applicable revenue for a fiscal year from title iv programs 
for our fiscal year  the range of our campus groups was from approximately to approximately 
in  we purchased one facility for million  purchased for million two facilities that we intend to renovate  purchased for million three parcels of land on which we intend to build facilities  and incurred million for initial and ongoing construction costs associated with eight facilities 
in  we purchased one facility for million  purchased for million four parcels of land on which we commenced construction of facilities  and incurred million for initial and ongoing construction costs associated with four facilities 
in  we purchased the facilities of five of our institutes and our corporate headquarters for a total of million 
we may purchase or build additional facilities for our institutes in our capital assets  other than our facilities discussed above  consist primarily of classroom and laboratory equipment such as computers  electronic equipment and robotic systems  classroom and office furniture  software and leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures  excluding facility and land purchases and facility construction  totaled million in and million in to date  cash generated from operations has been sufficient to meet our capital expenditures 
we plan to continue to upgrade and expand current facilities and equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures  excluding facility and land purchases and facility construction  will be approximately to million 
the capital additions generally approximate million for a new institute and million for a new learning site 
we anticipate that our planned capital additions can be funded from cash flows from operations 
cash flows on a long term basis are highly dependent upon the receipt of title iv program funds and the amount of funds spent on new institutes  new learning sites  curricula additions at existing institutes and possible acquisitions 
we do not believe that any reduction in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash or investments that may result from their use to effect any future stock repurchases  facility purchases or construction of facilities will have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans  planned capital expenditures

there are no material restrictions imposed by the lease agreements  and we have not entered into any significant guarantees related to the leases 
we are required to make additional payments under the operating lease terms for taxes  insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period 
as part of our normal course of operations  one of our insurers issues surety bonds for us that are required by various education authorities that regulate us

from through  we entered into agreements with unaffiliated  private funding sources to provide supplemental loans to students to help pay the students cost of education that federal and state financial aid sources did not cover

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have investments in marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities  which are classified as available for sale or held to maturity  depending on our investment intentions with regard to those securities 
marketable debt securities classified as available for sale securities are recorded at their market value 
marketable debt securities classified as held to maturity securities are recorded at their amortized cost  because we have the intent and ability to hold those investments until they mature 
auction rate preferred equity securities are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded at their market value 
investments that we intend to hold for more than one year are classified as non current investments 
we estimate that the market risk associated with our investments in marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities can best be measured by a potential decrease in the fair value of these securities resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
if such a hypothetical increase in rates were to occur  the reduction in the market value of our portfolio of marketable debt and auction rate preferred equity securities would not be material
