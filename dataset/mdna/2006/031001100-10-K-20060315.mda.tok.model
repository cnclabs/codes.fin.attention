item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ames national corporation company is a bank holding company established in that owns and operates five bank subsidiaries banks in central iowa 
the following discussion is provided for the consolidated operations of the company and its banks  first national  state bank  boone bank  randall story bank and united bank 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant factors affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not engage in any material business activities apart from its ownership of the banks and managing its own bond and equity portfolio 
products and services offered by the banks are for commercial and consumer purposes  including loans  deposits and trust services 
the banks also offer investment services through a third party broker dealer 
the company employs ten individuals to assist with financial reporting  human resources  marketing  audit  compliance  technology systems and the coordination of management activities  in addition to full time equivalent individuals employed by the banks 
the company s primary competitive strategy is to utilize seasoned and competent bank management and local decision making authority to provide customers with prompt response times and flexibility in the products and services offered 
this strategy is viewed as providing an opportunity to increase revenues through creating a competitive advantage over other financial institutions 
the company also strives to remain operationally efficient to provide better profitability while enabling the company to offer more competitive loan and deposit rates 
the principal sources of company revenues and cashflow are i interest and fees earned on loans made by the banks  ii service charges on deposit accounts maintained at the banks  iii interest on fixed income investments held by the banks  iv fees on trust services provided by those banks exercising trust powers  and v securities gains and dividends on equity investments held by the company and the banks 
the company s principal expenses are i interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings  ii salaries and employee benefits  iii data processing costs associated with maintaining the banks loan and deposit functions  and iv occupancy expenses for maintaining the banks facilities 
the largest component contributing to the company s net income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets primarily loans and investments and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities primarily deposit accounts and other borrowings 
one of management s principal functions is to manage the spread between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities in an effort to maximize net interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of interest rate risk 
the company reported net income of  for the year ended december  compared to  and  reported for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of when comparing and  and an increase of when comparing and the decline in net income in is primarily the result of lower net interest income as the result of higher market interest rates causing deposit interest expense to increase more quickly than interest income on earning assets 
the improvement in net income for can be attributed primarily to higher net interest income resulting from a higher volume of loans and investments partially offset by lower secondary market income and security gains 
earnings per share for were compared to a record in and in each of the banks had profitable operations during 
table of contents the company s return on average equity for was compared to and in and  respectively  and the return on average assets for was compared to in and in lower net interest income caused both the return on average equity and return on average assets to decline in compared to higher net income and lower capital levels relating to the average net unrealized gain on securities available for sale contributed to the improved return on average equity in the decline in the return on average assets in can be attributed to growth in assets at slightly lower profitability margins 
the following discussion will provide a summary review of important items relating to challenges key performance indicators and industry results income statement review balance sheet review asset quality and credit risk management liquidity and capital resources interest rate risk challenges management has identified certain challenges that may negatively impact the company s revenues in the future and is attempting to position the company to best respond to those challenges 
rising interest rates will present a challenge to the company in continued increases in interest rates may negatively impact the company s net interest margin if interest expense increases more quickly than interest income 
the company s earning assets primarily its loan and investment portfolio have longer maturities than its interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and other borrowings  therefore  in a rising interest rate environment  interest expense will increase more quickly than interest income as the interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than earning assets 
in response to this challenge  the banks model quarterly the changes in income that would result from various changes in interest rates 
management believes bank earning assets have the appropriate maturity and repricing characteristics to optimize earnings and the banks interest rate risk positions 
the company s market in central iowa has numerous banks  credit unions  investment and insurance companies competing for similar business opportunities 
this competitive environment will continue to put downward pressure on the banks net interest margins and thus affect profitability 
strategic planning efforts at the company and banks continue to focus on capitalizing on the banks strengths in local markets while working to identify opportunities for improvement to gain competitive advantages 

table of contents a substandard performance in the company s equity portfolio could lead to a reduction in the historical level of realized security gains  thereby negatively impacting the company s earnings 
the company invests capital that may be utilized for future expansion in a portfolio of primarily financial and utility stocks with an estimated fair market value of approximately million as of december  the company focuses on stocks that have historically paid dividends in an effort to lessen the negative effects of a bear market 
key performance indicators and industry results certain key performance indicators for the company and the industry are presented in the following chart 
the industry figures are compiled by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and are derived from  commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the fdic 
management reviews these indicators on a quarterly basis for purposes of comparing the company s performance from quarter to quarter against the industry as a whole 
selected indicators for the company and the industry year ended december  company industry company industry company industry return on assets return on equity net interest margin efficiency ratio capital ratio key performance indicators include return on assets this ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average assets 
it is used to measure how effectively the assets of the company are being utilized in generating income 
although the company s return on assets ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  this ratio declined in as compared to as the result of lower net interest income 
return on equity this ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average equity 
it is used to measure the net income or return the company generated for the shareholders equity investment in the company 
the company s return on equity ratio is below that of the industry primarily as a result of lower net interest income in and the higher level of capital the company maintains for future growth and acquisitions 

table of contents net interest margin the ratio is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 
earning assets consist primarily of loans and investments that earn interest 
this ratio is used to measure how well the company is able to maintain interest rates on earning assets above those of interest bearing liabilities  which is the interest expense paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings 
the company s net interest margin is in line with peer bank averages but has fallen since as rising market interest rates have caused interest expense to increase more quickly than interest income 
efficiency ratio this ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income and noninterest income 
the ratio is a measure of the company s ability to manage noninterest expenses 
the company s efficiency ratio compares favorably to the industry average 
capital ratio the capital ratio is calculated by dividing average total equity capital by average total assets 
it measures the level of average assets that are funded by shareholders equity 
given an equal level of risk in the financial condition of two companies  the higher the capital ratio  generally the more financially sound the company 
the company s capital ratio is significantly higher than the industry average 
industry results the fdic quarterly banking profile reported the following results for the fourth quarter of challenged by a flattening yield curve and softening loan demand  fdic insured institutions managed to post their fourth best earnings quarter ever in the fourth quarter of net income of the  insured banks and thrifts was billion higher than in the fourth quarter of  thanks primarily to a billion increase in net interest income 
noninterest income made a modest million pretax contribution to the improvement in earnings 
against these positive factors  expenses for loan loss provisions were million higher  and gains on sales of securities and other assets were million lower 
noninterest expenses registered a small increase  rising by million from a year earlier 
the average return on assets roa in the fourth quarter was  the lowest quarterly level since the fourth quarter of the average roa in the fourth quarter of was 
almost half of all insured institutions reported a fourth quarter roa of one percent or better  slightly above the of institutions that achieved that benchmark in the fourth quarter of at the other end of the performance spectrum  the share of unprofitable institutions declined slightly to  from a year earlier 
more than half of all institutions reported higher quarterly earnings  and higher quarterly roas than a year ago 
the average net interest margin in the fourth quarter was  down slightly from in the third quarter  and matching the fourteen year low level reached in the second quarter 
the average margin in the fourth quarter of was 
a combination of rising short term interest rates and relatively stable longer term rates has caused the spread between these rates to diminish considerably throughout for insured banks and thrifts  which have traditionally lent long and borrowed short  the narrowing of this spread has put downward pressure on the relative profitability of their lending and deposit taking 
the effect has been less pronounced at smaller institutions during they obtain most of their funding from smaller denomination core deposits  which tend to reprice upward more slowly when short term interest rates rise 
large institutions fund a larger share of their assets with short term nondeposit liabilities  which reprice more quickly when rates rise 
a majority of institutions reported higher net interest margins for the full year in than they reported for  but most of the improvements occurred prior to the fourth quarter  and they were concentrated among smaller institutions 
the increase in net interest income between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of was made possible by growth in interest earning assets during that period which outweighed the negative effect of the narrower average margin 

table of contents income statement review the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
critical accounting policy the discussion contained in this item and other disclosures included within this report are based on the company s audited consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained in these statements is  for the most part  based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
however  the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements accompanying the company s audited financial statements 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments  management has identified the allowance for loan losses to be the company s most critical accounting policy 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses that is treated as an expense and charged against earnings 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio  including timely identification of potential problem loans 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  incorporating a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  known information about individual loans and other factors 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s market area and the expected trend of the economic conditions 
to the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management s judgment  the allowance for loan losses may be greater or lesser than future charge offs 

table of contents average balances and interest rates the following two tables are used to calculate the company s net interest margin 
the first table includes the company s average assets and the related income to determine the average yield on earning assets 
the second table includes the average liabilities and related expense to determine the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to the interest income less the interest expense divided by average earning assets 
assets average balance revenue expense yield rate average balance revenue expense yield rate average balance revenue expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans commercial agricultural real estate consumer and other total loans including fees investment securities taxable tax exempt total investment securities interest bearing deposits with banks federal funds sold total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment  net other  less allowance for loan losses total noninterest earning assets total assets average loan balance includes nonaccrual loans  if any 
interest income collected on nonaccrual loans has been included 
tax exempt income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using an incremental tax rate of

table of contents rate and volume analysis the rate and volume analysis is used to determine how much of the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest rate 
for example  real estate interest income increased  in compared to an increased volume of real estate loans added  in income in and higher interest rates increased interest income in by  the following table sets forth  on a tax equivalent basis  a summary of the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates

table of contents net interest income the company s largest component contributing to net income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets which are primarily loans and investments and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities which are primarily deposits accounts and other borrowings 
the volume of and yields earned on earning assets and the volume of and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities determine net interest income 
refer to the tables preceding this paragraph for additional detail 
interest earned and interest paid is also affected by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  and by government policies and the action of regulatory authorities 
net interest income divided by average earning assets is referred to as net interest margin 
for the years december   and  the company s net interest margin was  and  respectively 
net interest income during  and totaled   and  respectively  representing a decrease in from and a increase in compared to net interest income has fallen since as rising market interest rates have caused interest expense to increase more quickly than interest income 
a higher volume of earning assets was the primary reason for the increase in net interest income in the high level of competition in the local markets and increasing market interest rates will continue to put downward pressure on the net interest margin of the company 
currently  the company s largest market  ames  iowa  has eight banks  three thrifts  four credit unions and several other financial investment companies 
multiple banks are also located in the company s other communities creating similarly competitive environments 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses reflects management s judgment of the expense to be recognized in order to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the company recorded a  provision for loan losses during compared to  in and  in lower problem loans in compared to was the primary reason for the lower provision expense in a lower level of charge offs in led the reduction in provision expense in compared to refer to the asset quality and credit risk management discussion for additional details with regard to loan loss provision expense 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb probable losses in the current portfolio 
this statement is based upon management s continuing evaluation of inherent risks in the current loan portfolio  current levels of classified assets and general economic factors 
the company will continue to monitor the allowance and make future adjustments to the allowance as conditions dictate 
noninterest income and expense total noninterest income is comprised primarily of fee based revenues from trust and agency services  bank related service charges on deposit activities  net securities gains generated primarily by the company s equity holdings  merchant and atm fees related to electronic processing of merchant and cash transactions and secondary market income 

table of contents noninterest income during  and totaled   and  respectively  representing a increase in from and an decrease in from the increase in is the result of higher trust and net securities gains with the decrease in the result of lower secondary market income and net securities gains 
the lower secondary market income in was primarily attributed to a slow down in refinancing activity compared to trust income has increased as the result of additional assets under management 
noninterest expense for the company consists of all operating expenses other than interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds 
historically  the company has not had any material expenses relating to discontinued operations  extraordinary losses or adjustments from a change in accounting principles 
salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of the company s operating expenses and comprise of noninterest expenses in noninterest expense during  and totaled   and  respectively  representing a increase in versus and a increase in compared to lower incentive compensation for senior officers of the company and banks in contributed to the limited increase in noninterest expense 
the retirement of several higher paid senior officers allowed for stable non interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the percentage of noninterest expense to average assets was in  compared to and during and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for  and was   and  respectively 
this amount represents an effective tax rate of during  compared to and for and  respectively 
the company s marginal federal tax rate is currently 
the difference between the company s effective and marginal tax rate is primarily related to investments made in tax exempt securities 
the average balance of tax exempt securities in   and totaled   and  respectively 
balance sheet review the company s assets are comprised primarily of loans and investment securities 
average earning asset maturity or repricing dates are less than five years for the combined portfolios as the assets are funded for the most part by short term deposits with either immediate availability or less than one year average maturities 
this exposes the company to risk with regard to changes in interest rates that are more fully explained in item a of this report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
total assets decreased to  in compared to  in  a decrease 
the mix of assets changed as maturing investments were reinvested in higher yielding loans 
first national had a decline of  in total assets that was anticipated as a local company had a significant level of temporary construction funds invested with the bank as securities sold under an agreement to repurchase as of december  that were withdrawn in loan portfolio net loans for the year ended december   increased to  from  as of december   an increase of 
the increase in loan volume can be primarily attributed to growth in the commercial loan portfolio resulting primarily from the combination of new borrowers and the purchase of commercial loans from other iowa banks

the nominal increase of  can be attributed to deposit growth at first national and state bank 
the deposit category seeing the largest balance increases were time certificates of deposits over  as depositors moved money from lower yielding non maturing deposit accounts to higher yielding certificates of deposit 
the company s primary source of funds is customer deposits 
the company attempts to attract noninterest bearing deposits  which are a low cost funding source 
in addition  the banks offer a variety of interest bearing accounts designed to attract both short term and longer term deposits from customers 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by bank management based on competitive market factors and the company s need for funds 
while nearly of the banks certificates of deposit mature in the next year  it is anticipated that a majority of these certificates will be renewed 
rate sensitive certificates of deposits in excess of  are subject to somewhat higher volatility with regard to renewal volume as the banks adjust rates based upon funding needs 
in the event a substantial volume of certificates are not renewed  the company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund significant runoff 
a sustained reduction in deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the company s operation and liquidity 
the company traditionally has not relied upon brokered deposits and does not anticipate utilizing such funds at the present time

asset quality review and credit risk management the company s credit risk is centered in the loan portfolio  which on december  totaled  as compared to  as of december   an increase of 
loans comprise of total assets as of the end of the object in managing loan portfolio risk is to reduce the risk of loss resulting from a customer s failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction and to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis 
as the following chart indicates  the company s credit risk management practices have resulted in a low level of non performing assets that total  as of december  the company s level of problem assets as a percentage of assets of as december  compares favorably to the average for fdic insured institutions as of september  of 
non performing assets the following table sets forth information concerning the company s non performing assets for the past five years ending december  dollars in thousands non performing assets nonaccrual loans loans days or more past due and still accruing total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets the accrual of interest on non accrual and other impaired loans is discontinued at days or when  in the opinion of management  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when interest accrual is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
interest income on restructured loans is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement 
interest income on other impaired loans is monitored and based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement 
however  the recorded net investment in impaired loans  including accrued interest  is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair market value of the loan s collateral

loans greater than days past due and still accruing interest were approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
first national obtained title in to a commercial property securing a large problem credit that accounts for the decrease in nonaccrual loans and the increase in other real estate owned 
summary of the allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents an expense charged against earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management and the respective bank boards 
this evaluation focuses on specific loan reviews  changes in the type and volume of the loan portfolio given the current and forecasted economic conditions and historical loss experience 
any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan concern about whether the customer s cash flow or net worth are sufficient to repay the loan  delinquent status  criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination  the accrual of interest has been suspended  or other reasons  including when the loan has other special or unusual characteristics which warrant special monitoring 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the estimated losses on loans 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 

table of contents analysis of the allowance for loan losses the company s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize future recoveries 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in the company s allowance for loan losses for the most recent five years 
dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs real estate construction family residential commercial agricultural commercial agricultural consumer and other total charge offs recoveries real estate construction family residential commercial agricultural commercial agricultural consumer and other total recoveries net charge offs additions charged to operations balance at end of period average loans outstanding ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans net of deferred fees 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses increased to  at the end of in comparison to the allowance of  at year end the increase can be primarily attributed to the growth in the in the company s commercial loan portfolio at first national and united bank 
the increase in the reserve levels in compared to relate primarily to general reserves established by first national 
the general reserve methodology has remained consistent for the five years presented 
general reserves for loan categories normally range from to of the outstanding loan balances 
as loan volume increases  the general reserve levels increase with that growth 
as the previous table indicates  loan provisions have been trending downward since as the level of net charge offs has declined 
the allowance relating to commercial real estate  family residential and commercial loans are the largest reserve components 
commercial real estate loans have higher general reserve levels than family and agricultural real estate loans as management perceives more risk in this type of lending 
elements contributing to the higher risk level include susceptibility of businesses to changing environmental factors such as the economic business cycle  the larger individual loan amounts  a limited number of buyers and the specialized uses for some properties 
as of december   commercial real estate loans have general reserves of 
the estimation methods and assumptions used in determining the allowance for the five years presented have remained fairly consistent 
the level of non performing loans has improved considerably in compared to as the result of one large credit being reclassified as other real estate 
loans that the banks have identified as having higher risk levels are reviewed individually in an effort to establish adequate loss reserves 
these reserves are considered specific reserves and are directly impacted by the credit quality of the underlying loans 
normally  as the actual or expected level of non performing loans increase  the specific reserves also increase 
for december  specific reserves increased  or compared to year end levels as the volume of watch credits increased in as of december   specific reserves decreased  or over year end as the result of improved loan quality 
as of december   specific reserves increased  or over year end in  specific allocations to problem agricultural real estate loans was the largest contributor to the increase in the specific reserve level when compared to year end the specific reserves are dependent upon assumptions regarding the liquidation value of collateral and the cost of recovering collateral including legal fees 
changing the amount of specific reserves on individual loans has historically had the largest impact on the reallocation of the reserve among different parts of the portfolio 
other factors that are considered when determining the adequacy of the reserve include loan concentrations  loan growth  the economic outlook and historical losses 
the company s concentration risks include geographic concentration in central iowa  the local economy s dependence upon several large governmental entity employers  including iowa state university and the iowa department of transportation  and the health of iowa s agricultural sector that in turn  is dependent on weather conditions and government programs 
however  no assurances can be made that losses will remain at the favorable levels experienced over the past five years

liquidity and capital resources liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its banks asset and liability committees alco  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
these commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  maintaining adequate collateral for pledging for public funds  trust deposits and borrowings  paying dividends to shareholders  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is derived primarily from core deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include federal funds purchased lines  federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other capital market sources 
as of december   the level of liquidity and capital resources of the company remain at a satisfactory level and compare favorably to that of other fdic insured institutions 
management believes that the company s liquidity sources will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 

table of contents the liquidity and capital resources discussion will cover the follows topics review of the company s current liquidity sources review of the consolidated statements of cash flows review of company only cash flows review of commitments for capital expenditures  cash flow uncertainties and known trends in liquidity and cash flows needs capital resources review of the company s current liquidity sources liquid assets of cash on hand  balances due from other banks  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits in financial institutions for december   and totaled   and  respectively 
the lower balance of liquid assets as of december  relates to a lower level of federal funds sold to other financial institutions 
other sources of liquidity available to the banks include outstanding lines of credit with the federal home loan bank of des moines  iowa of  and federal funds borrowing capacity at correspondent banks of  as of december   the company had outstanding fhlb advances of  federal funds purchased of  and securities sold under agreement to repurchase totaled  and treasury tax and loan option notes of  total investments as of december  were  compared to  as of year end as of december  and  the investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets was and  respectively 
this provides the company with a significant amount of liquidity since all of the investments are classified as available for sale as of december  and and have net unrealized gains of  and  respectively 
the investment portfolio serves an important role in the overall context of balance sheet management in terms of balancing capital utilization and liquidity 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity and credit considerations 
the portfolio s scheduled maturities represent a significant source of liquidity 
review of the consolidated statements of cash flows operating cash flows for december   and totaled   and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows in compared to was the use of cash to fund loans held for sale and lower net income 
the decrease in operating cash flows in compared to included a reduction in loans held for sale and an increase in other assets in these decreases were offset by security gains realized in as compared to and an increase net income 
net cash provided used in investing activities for december   and was   and  respectively 
the net cash provided from investing activities in was primarily proceeds from the sale or maturity of investment securities and federal funds sold that were utilized to fund a lower level of securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the largest investing activities in were the purchase of us government agency and corporate bonds and the funding of commercial operating and commercial real estate loans offset by the maturities  calls  and sales of securities available for sale 
us government agency bonds  municipal bonds and commercial real estate loans were the most significant investing activities in 
table of contents net cash used in provided by financing activities for december   and totaled   and  respectively 
a decline in securities sold under agreements to repurchase was the primary use of financing funds in and were the primary contributing factor to increase in financing cash flows in deposit growth was the primary source of cash flows for as of december   the company did not have any external debt financing  off balance sheet financing arrangements or derivative instruments linked to its stock 
review of company only cash flows the company s liquidity on an unconsolidated basis is heavily dependent upon dividends paid to the company by the banks 
the company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses and pay stockholder dividends 
in  dividends from the banks amounted to  compared to  in various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends banking subsidiaries are permitted to pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval 
federal reserve policy further limits the circumstances under which bank holding companies may declare dividends 
for example  a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
in addition  the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
federal and state banking regulators may also restrict the payment of dividends by order 
first national and united bank  as national banks  generally may pay dividends  without obtaining the express approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency  in an amount up to its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years plus retain net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year 
retained net profits  as defined by the occ  consists of net income less dividends declared during the period 
boone bank  randall story bank and state bank are also restricted under iowa law to paying dividends only out of their undivided profits 
united bank is not expected to generate sufficient earnings to pay any dividends in additionally  the payment of dividends by the banks is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations  and the banks generally are prohibited from paying any dividends if  following payment thereof  the bank would be undercapitalized 
the company has unconsolidated interest bearing deposits and marketable investment securities totaling  that are presently available to provide additional liquidity to the banks 
review of commitments for capital expenditures  cash flow uncertainties and known trends in liquidity and cash flows needs no material capital expenditures or material changes in the capital resource mix are anticipated at this time 
commitments to extend credit totaled  as of december  compared to a total of  at the end of the timing of these credit commitments varies with the underlying borrowers  however  the company has satisfactory liquidity to fund these obligations as of december  the primary cash flow uncertainty would be a sudden decline in deposits causing the banks to liquidate securities 
historically  the banks have maintained an adequate level of short term marketable investments to fund the temporary declines in deposit balances 
there are no known trends in liquidity and cash flow needs as of december  that are a concern to management 

table of contents capital resources the company s total stockholders equity decreased to  at december   from  at december  at december  and  stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets was and  respectively 
total equity decreased due to depreciation in the banks investment portfolios and higher dividends declared which was partially offset by the retention of earnings 
the capital levels of the company currently exceed applicable regulatory guidelines as of december  on june   shareholders of the company approved an amendment to the restated articles of incorporation increasing the company s authorized common stock from million to million shares and reducing the par value of such common stock from to per share 
the purpose of the amendment was to provide a sufficient number of shares of authorized common stock to accommodate a for stock split previously approved by the board of directors of the company on may  the stock split was effective july  for holders of record as of july  share and per share data for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the stock split 
the board of directors of the company approved a stock repurchase program on november  the company has a strong capital position and this program provides an opportunity to repurchase company stock on the open market when it is deemed to be favorably priced for repurchase 
the program authorizes the repurchase of up to  shares during the calendar year  or approximately of  shares of common stock presently outstanding 
the repurchases will be made in open market transactions at the discretion of management using company cash 
the timing and actual number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors such as price  the company s liquidity position and other market conditions 
the program may be limited or discontinued at any time without notice 
the company did not repurchase any shares in interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the impact that a change in interest rates may have on the company s earnings and capital 
management s objectives are to control interest rate risk and to ensure predictable and consistent growth of earnings and capital 
interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income identified through computer simulations to evaluate volatility  varying interest rate  spread and volume assumptions 
the risk is quantified and compared against tolerance levels 
the company uses a third party computer software simulation modeling program to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes 
for various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates  numerous other assumptions are made such as prepayment speeds on loans  the slope of the treasury yield curve  the rates and volumes of the company s deposits and the rates and volumes of the company s loans 
this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 

table of contents another measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio 
this ratio indicates the amount of interest earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time 
a gap ratio of indicates a matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal 
a gap ratio of less than indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period and a ratio greater than indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities 
the simulation model process provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity  whereas a static interest rate gap table is compiled as of a point in time 
the model simulations differ from a traditional gap analysis  as a traditional gap analysis does not reflect the multiple effects of interest rate movement on the entire range of assets and liabilities and ignores the future impact of new business strategies 
inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is to increase asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than they would on non financial companies 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and  if significant  require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would be otherwise necessary 
forward looking statements and business risks the discussion in the foregoing management discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report contains forward looking statements about the company  its business and its prospects 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they often include use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  estimate or words of similar meaning  or future or conditional verbs such as will  would  should  could or may 
forward looking statements  by their nature  are subject to risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  could cause actual conditions  events or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties with respect to the company include  but are not limited to  those related to the economic conditions  particularly in the areas in which the company and the banks operate  competitive products and pricing  fiscal and monetary policies of the us government  changes in governmental regulations affecting financial institutions  including regulatory fees and capital requirements  changes in prevailing interest rates  credit risk management and asset liability management  the financial and securities markets and the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity 
these factors may not constitute all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statement 
the company operates in a continually changing business environment and new facts emerge from time to time 
it cannot predict such factors nor can it assess the impact  if any  of such factors on its financial position or its results of operations 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results 
the company disclaims any responsibility to update any forward looking statement provided in this document 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of making loans and taking deposits 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the company s net interest income 
management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk 
management does not believe that the company s primary market risk exposure and how that exposure was managed in changed when compared to based on a simulation modeling analysis performed as of december   the following table presents the estimated change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates for the various rate shock levels 
table of contents net interest income at risk estimated change in net interest income for year ending december  change change dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points as shown above  at december   the estimated effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by or approximately  in the estimated effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would increase the company s net interest income by or approximately  in the company s asset liability management policy establishes parameters for a basis point change in interest rates 
under this policy  the company and the banks objective is to properly structure the balance sheet to prevent a basis point change in interest rates from causing a decline in net interest income by more than in one year compared to the base year that hypothetically assumes no change in interest rates 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
current interest rates on certain liabilities are at a level that does not allow for significant repricing should market interest rates decline considerably 

table of contents contractual maturity or repricing the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or re pricing  and the resulting interest sensitivity gap  of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at december  the expected maturities are presented on a contractual basis 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayment assumptions  early withdrawal of deposits and competition 
less than three months three months to one year one to five years over five years cumulative total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks federal funds sold investments loans loans held for sale total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market and savings deposits time certificates  time certificates  other borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets investments with maturities over years include the market value of equity securities of  
table of contents as of december   the company s cumulative gap ratios for assets and liabilities repricing within three months and within one year were and  respectively  meaning more liabilities than assets are scheduled to reprice within these periods 
this situation suggests that a decrease in market interest rates may benefit net interest income and that an increase in interest rates may negatively impact the company 
the liability sensitive gap position is largely the result of classifying the interest bearing now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts as immediately repriceable 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities and periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
also  interest rates on assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other assets and liabilities may follow changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets  both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets
