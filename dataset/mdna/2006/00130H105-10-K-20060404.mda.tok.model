item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity for more detail 
if environmental and land use regulations change in the future  we may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover from our customers some or all costs to comply with such environmental or land use regulations or that our business  financial conditions or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected 
various licenses  permits and approvals are required for our operations 
failure to comply with permits or approvals  or with environmental laws  can result in fines  penalties  or interruptions to our operations 
while we have at times been out of compliance with environmental laws and regulations  past non compliance has not resulted in the revocation of material permits or licenses and has not had a material impact on our operations or results 
air emissions 
the us clean air act and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of major air pollutants  including sulfur dioxide so  nitrogen oxides nox and particulate matter pm in the us the environmental protection agency s epa rulemaking requiring adjustments to state implementation plans relating to nox emissions the nox sip call resulted in operators of coal fired electric generating facilities in us states and the district of columbia either i reducing their nox emissions to levels allocated under the plan or ii purchasing nox emissions allowances from other operators in order to meet allocated emissions levels by may  we are in the process or have completed installing selective catalytic reduction scr and other nox control technologies at three facilities of our subsidiary  indianapolis power and light ipl in response to nox sip call implementation and other proposed air emissions regulations that are discussed in more detail below 
in march  the epa finalized two rules that will affect many of our us coal fired power generating plants 
the first rule  named the clean air interstate rule cair  was promulgated on march  and requires significant reductions of so and nox emissions from existing power plants located in eastern states and the district of columbia 
the required emission reductions will be in two phases with the first phase beginning in and for nox and so  respectively  and a second phase with additional reductions in both air pollutant emissions beginning in the second rule  called the clean air mercury rule  was issued on march  and requires reductions of mercury emissions from coal fired power plants in two phases 
the first phase will begin in and will require nationwide reduction of coal fired power plant mercury emissions from to tons per year 
the second phase will begin in and will require nationwide reduction of mercury emissions from these sources from tons per year to tons per year 
the clean air mercury rule also establishes stringent mercury emission performance standards for new coal fired power plants 
the epa has granted reconsideration on certain aspects of this rule 
to implement the required emission reductions for these two new rules  the states will establish emission allowance based nox  so and mercury emission cap and trade programs 
while the exact impact and cost of these two new rules cannot be established until the states complete the process of assigning emission allowances to our affected facilities  there can be no assurance that our business  financial conditions or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by these new rules 
the new york state department of environmental conservation nysdec recently promulgated regulations requiring electric generators to reduce so emissions by below current us clean air act standards 
the so regulations began to be phased in beginning on january  with implementation to be completed by january  these regulations also establish stringent nox reduction requirements year round  rather than just during the summertime ozone season 
as a result  in order to operate our four electric generation facilities located in new york  installation of pollution control technology will likely be required 
in july  the epa published the regional haze rule to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas 
on june   epa proposed amendments to the regional haze rule that  among other things  set guidelines for determining when to require the installation of best available retrofit technology bart at older plants 
the proposed amendment to the regional haze rule would require states to consider the visibility impacts of the haze produced by an individual facility  among other factors  when determining whether that facility must install potentially costly emissions controls 
states are required to submit to the epa their regional haze state implementation plans by december states that adopt the cair cap and trade program for so and nox are allowed to apply cair controls as a substitute for controls required under bart 
on june   epa proposed a rule for an emission trading program under the regional haze program 
currently  in the united states there are no federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction programs  including carbon dioxide co  affecting our electricity power generation facilities 
the us congress has debated a number of proposed greenhouse gas legislative initiatives  but to date there have been no new federal laws in this area 
also  individual states and groups of states are also examining possible greenhouse gas emission reduction programs including the state of california and a group of seven northeastern states under an initiative called the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi 
although final legislation or regulations implementing the california and rggi greenhouse gas emission reduction programs has yet to be enacted  these greenhouse gas related initiatives may potentially affect aes electric power generation facilities in california  new york  connecticut and new jersey 
at present  we cannot predict whether compliance with potential future us national  regional and state greenhouse gas emission reduction programs will have a material impact on our operations or results 
in europe we are  and will continue to be  required to reduce air emissions from our facilities to comply with applicable european community ec directives  including directive ec on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants the lcpd  which sets emission limit values for nox  so  and particulate matter for large scale industrial combustion plants for all member states 
until june  existing coal plants could opt in or opt out of the lcpd emissions standards 
those plants that opted out will be required to cease all operations by  and may not operate for more than  hours after those that opt in  like our aes kilroot facility in the united kingdom  must invest in abatement technology to achieve specific so reductions 
generally  aes s other coal plants in europe have opted in but will not require any additional abatement technology to comply with the lcpd 
in july  the ec directive ec on greenhouse gas emission allowance trading was created  which requires member states to limit emissions of co from large industrial sources within their countries 
to do so  member states will be required to implement ec approved national allocation plans naps 
under the naps  member states will be responsible for allocating limited co allowances within their borders 
directive ec does not dictate how these allocations are to be made and naps that have been submitted thus far have varied their allocation methodologies 
for these and other reasons  there remain significant uncertainties regarding the application of the european union emissions trading system which commenced operation in january based on our current analyses  we expect that certain aes businesses will be under allocated and others will be over allocated 
at present  we cannot predict whether compliance with the respective naps will have a material impact on our operations or results 
on february   the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change the kyoto protocol became effective 
the kyoto protocol requires countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their greenhouse gas emissions including co aes has generation operations in six countries that have ratified the kyoto protocol 
over the course of the next several years  as decisions surrounding implementation of the kyoto protocol become more detailed  we will have a better understanding of the impact of the kyoto protocol on the company 
at present  we cannot predict whether compliance with the kyoto protocol will have a material impact on our operations or results 
water discharges 
our facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water discharges 
in particular  we are evaluating the impact of the us clean water act section b rule regarding cooling water intake 
to protect fish and other aquatic organisms  the rule requires existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the best technology available for cooling water intake structures 
we believe that many of our facilities will be affected by this rule 
to comply  we must first prepare a comprehensive demonstration study to assess each facility s effect on the local aquatic environment 
because each facility s design  location  existing control equipment and results of impact assessments must be taken into consideration  costs will likely vary 
the timing of capital expenditures to achieve compliance with this rule will vary from site to site  and may begin as early as for some of our us plants 
at present  however  we cannot predict whether compliance with the b rule will have a material impact on our operations or results 
waste management 
in the course of operations  our facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal 
with the exception of coal combustion products ccp  our wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property  but are shipped off site for final disposal  treatment or recycling 
ccp  which consists of bottom ash  fly ash and air pollution control wastes  is disposed of at some of our coal fired power generation plant sites using engineered  permitted landfills 
waste materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities include ccp  oil  scrap metal  rubbish  small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents  tree and land clearing wastes and polychlorinated biphenyl pcb contaminated liquids and solids 
we endeavor to ensure that all our solid and liquid wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable national  regional  state and local regulations 
item a 
risk factors investing in our company involves a high degree risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to invest in our company 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were determined not to be effective as of december  and december   due to the material weaknesses that existed in our internal control over financial reporting 
our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not be effective in future periods  as a result of existing or newly identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
as required by the federal securities laws  our management periodically performs an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and conducts an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files with the sec under the exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported  within the time periods specified by the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures 
internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by a company s senior management to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in performing the assessment at the end of and  our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  that adversely affects a company s ability to initiate  authorize  record  process  or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
for a discussion of the material weaknesses identified by our management  see item a of this annual report on form k 
due to these material weaknesses  our management concluded that as of december  and december   our company did not maintain effective control over financial reporting and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective 
during our remediation efforts to correct the material weakness that was identified at the end of  errors were discovered in our financial statements which resulted from such material weakness  as well as newly identified material weaknesses 
these errors required us to restate our financial statements that were previously filed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  to address the material weaknesses  we performed additional analysis and other post closing procedures in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these additional procedures were costly  time consuming and required us to dedicate a significant amount of our resources  including the time and attention of our senior management  toward the correction of these problems 
performing these additional procedures and the need to restate our financial statements also caused us to delay the filing of our quarterly reports for the second and third quarters of until january  which was well beyond the deadline prescribed by the sec s rules to file such reports 
in addition  during the year end closing process  additional errors were identified that required us to restate our and financial results 
these corrections are included in the annual report on form k 
the delays in filing our form k a  and restated quarterly reports  as well as the additional errors identified during the year end closing process caused the annual report on form k to be filed after the sec deadline for the annual report on form k  as well 
as a result of not timely filing the quarterly and annual reports with the sec  we lost our eligibility to offer and sell our securities pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s which could impair our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
in addition  the restatements and the delay in the filing of our quarterly and annual reports could have other adverse effects on our business  including  but not limited to civil litigation or an investigation by the sec or other regulatory authorities  which could require us to incur significant legal expenses and other costs or to pay damages  fines or other penalties  covenant defaults  and potentially events of default  under our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities  resulting from our failure to timely file our financial statements  negative publicity  or the loss or impairment of investor confidence in our company 
because of our decentralized structure and the many disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication at our various businesses throughout the world  there is still extensive work remaining to remedy the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
we have developed a remediation plan and have begun implementing this plan  but we expect that this work will extend throughout and possibly beyond 
we cannot assure you as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented  nor can we assure that additional material weaknesses will not be identified by our management or the auditors in the future 
until our remediation efforts are completed  we will continue to incur the expense and management burdens associated with the additional procedures required to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
there will also continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the sec  that a related default under our senior secured credit facilities and indentures could occur and that our financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected 
management  including our ceo and cfo  does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates 
in addition  the effect of new  or changes in  accounting policies and practices and the application of such policies and practices could adversely affect our business 
our high level of indebtedness  and the security provided for this indebtedness  could adversely affect our business and our ability to fulfill our obligations 
at december   we had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis  of which approximately billion was recourse debt of the aes corporation and approximately billion was non recourse debt 
all outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  our second priority senior secured notes and certain other indebtedness are secured by certain of our assets  including the pledge of capital stock of many of our directly held subsidiaries 
most of the debt of our subsidiaries is pledged by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries 
this level of indebtedness and related security could have important consequences to us and our investors because it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service and other obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our and our subsidiaries indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
the agreements governing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries limit but do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
to the extent we become more leveraged  the risks described above would increase 
further  our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected 
accordingly  our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and  in that event  we may not be able to borrow money  sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due 
we have significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity 
the aes corporation  which refers to the aes parent company  requires cash primarily to fund principal repayments of debt  interest and preferred dividends  acquisitions  construction and other project commitments  other equity commitments  taxes  and parent company overhead and development costs 
the aes corporation s principal sources of liquidity are dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries  proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level  and proceeds from asset sales 
for a more detailed discussion of our cash requirements and sources of liquidity  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity in this annual report on form k 
while we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the parent company level for the foreseeable future  this belief is based on a number of material assumptions  including  without limitation  assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets  the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries  exchange rates and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends 
any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect and therefore we cannot assure you that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected 
in addition  our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the principal outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancings 
existing and potential future defaults by project subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which  except as noted below  require the loans to be repaid solely from the project s revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans and interest thereon is secured solely by the capital stock  physical assets  contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate 
this type of financing is usually referred to as non recourse debt or project financing 
in some project financings  the aes corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities  most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events 
these obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees  indemnities  letter of credit reimbursement agreements  and agreements to pay  in certain circumstances  the project lenders or other parties 
to the extent the aes corporation becomes liable under such guarantees and other arrangements  distributions received by the aes corporation from other projects are subject to the possibility of being utilized by the aes corporation to satisfy these obligations 
at december   we had approximately billon of recourse debt and approximately billion of non recourse debt outstanding 
at december   the aes corporation had provided outstanding financial and performance related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of its subsidiaries  which were limited by the terms of the agreements  to an aggregate of approximately million excluding those collateralized by letter of credit obligations discussed below 
the aes corporation also is obligated under other commitments  which are limited to amounts  or percentages of amounts  received by the aes corporation as distributions from its project subsidiaries 
in addition  the aes corporation has commitments to fund its equity in projects currently under development or in construction 
at december   the aes corporation also had million in letters of credit outstanding and million in surety bonds outstanding  which operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and subsidiary operations 
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness 
the total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was million at december  while the lenders under our non recourse project financings generally do not have direct recourse to the aes corporation other than to the extent of any credit support given by the aes corporation  defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for the aes corporation s results of operations and liquidity  including  without limitation reducing the aes corporation s cash flows since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the aes corporation during the pendancy of any default  triggering the aes corporation s obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee  letter of credit or other credit support which the aes corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary  causing the aes corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets  or triggering defaults in the aes corporation s outstanding debt and trust preferred instruments 
for example  the aes corporation s senior secured credit facilities and outstanding senior notes and junior subordinated notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries 
in addition  the aes corporation s senior secured credit facilities include events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries 
none of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that meet the applicable definition of materiality in the aes corporation s senior secured credit facilities in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit an acceleration under such indebtedness 
however  as a result of future write down of assets  dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations  it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary s debt  trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes corporation s senior secured credit facilities 
our competitive supply and latin american operations represent a substantial portion of our assets and have caused and are expected to continue to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows 
the competitive supply segment of our business and our latin american operations each experience volatility in revenues and earnings and has had and is expected to continue to cause significant volatility on our results of operations and cash flows 
the competitive supply segment s volatility has resulted from volatile electricity prices  which are influenced by peak demand requirements  weather conditions  competition  market regulation  interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations  electricity transmission and environmental emission constraints  the availability or prices of emission credits and fuel prices  as well as plant availability and other relevant factors 
our latin american operations have experienced significant volatility because of regulatory and economic difficulties  political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these countries 
we do a significant amount of our business outside the united states which presents significant risks 
during  approximately of our revenue was generated outside the united states and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries 
part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in developing countries because the growth rates and the opportunity to implement operating improvements and achieve higher operating margins may be greater than those typically achievable in more developed countries 
international operations  particularly the operation  financing and development of projects in developing countries  entail significant risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation economic  social and political instability in any particular country or region  adverse changes in currency exchange rates  government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds  unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade  monetary or fiscal policies  high inflation and monetary fluctuations  restrictions on imports of coal  oil  gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate  expropriation of our assets by foreign governments  difficulties in hiring  training and retaining qualified personnel  particularly finance and accounting personnel with us gaap expertise  unwillingness of governments  government agencies or similar organizations to honor their contracts  inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political  regulatory  administrative and legal systems  difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions  and potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions 
any of these factors  by itself or in combination with others  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the ability to obtain financing on a commercially acceptable non recourse basis in developing nations is difficult 
even when such non recourse financing is available  lenders may require us to make higher equity investments or provide greater credit support than historically have been the case 
in addition  financing in countries with less than investment grade sovereign credit ratings may also require substantial participation by multilateral financing agencies 
there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained when needed 
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we operate in many foreign environments and such investment in foreign countries may be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  as well as from transaction exposure associated with generating revenues and incurring expenses in different currencies 
while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars  the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the united states are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars by applying an appropriate exchange rate 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies in which our subsidiaries outside the united states report could cause significant fluctuations in our results 
in addition  while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales  we have transaction exposure to the extent our receipts and expenditures  including debt service expenditures  are not offsetting in any currency 
moreover  the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations have been significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the argentine peso  brazilian real  the dominican republic peso  the pakistani rupee and the venezuelan bolivar relative to the us dollar 
depreciation of the argentine peso and brazilian real has resulted in foreign currency translation and transaction losses  while the appreciation of those currencies has resulted in gains 
conversely  depreciation of the venezuelan bolivar has resulted in foreign currency gains and appreciation has resulted in losses 
our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties 
certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing greenfield power plants  some but not all of which have signed long term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity 
successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks  including  but not limited to  risks relating to failures of siting  financing  construction  permitting  governmental approvals or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones 
we believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable  however  we cannot assure you that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation 
if these development efforts are not successful  we may abandon a project under development 
at the time of abandonment  we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities 
our acquisitions may not perform as expected 
historically  we have achieved a majority of our growth through acquisitions 
we plan to continue to grow our business through acquisitions 
although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories at the time we acquired them  we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located 
some of these businesses may be government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition 
if we were to acquire any of these types of businesses  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership  such businesses will perform as expected  we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities  such business will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them  or the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest our capital to acquire them 
acquisitions have placed  and in the future may place  a strain on our internal accounting and managerial controls 
in addition  our acquisitions outside the united states have required  and will require  us to hire personnel with sufficient expertise in us gaap to timely and accurately comply with our reporting obligations 
an inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse affect on our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations 
most of our contract generation businesses are dependent to a large degree on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers 
most of our contract generation businesses rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of  and in some case all of  the relevant plant s output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract 
the remaining term of the power sales contracts related to our contract generation power plants ranges from to years 
many of these businesses also limit their exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers 
the cash flows and results of operations of such businesses are dependent on the continued ability of their customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract  respectively 
some of contract generation businesses long term power sales agreements are for prices above current spot market prices 
the loss of one or more significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts  or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts to fulfill its obligations thereunder  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have sought to reduce this counter party credit risk for our contract generation businesses in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from the sovereign government of the customer s obligations 
however  many of our contract generation businesses customers do not have  or have failed to maintain  an investment grade credit rating  and our generation businesses can not always obtain government guarantees and if they do  the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating 
we have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns 
however  we cannot assure you that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful 
competition is increasing and could adversely affect us 
the power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors  many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience including both domestic and international experience and financial resources similar to or greater than ours 
further  in recent years  the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets 
in certain markets  these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and  in many cases  have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices 
the evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas fired power plants have also caused  or are anticipated to cause  price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing competitive factors will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our distribution businesses are highly regulated 
our distribution businesses face increased regulatory and political scrutiny in the normal conduct of their operations 
this scrutiny may adversely impact our results of operations to the extent that such scrutiny or pressure prevents us from reducing losses as quickly as we planned or denies us a rate increase called for by our concession agreements 
in general  our distribution businesses have lower margins and are more dependent on regulation to ensure expected annual rate increases for inflation  capital expenditures and increased fuel and power costs  among other things 
there can be no assurance that these rate reviews will be granted  or occur in a timely manner 
our ability to raise capital on favorable terms  to refinance existing corporate or subsidiary indebtedness or to fund operations  capital expenditures  future acquisitions  construction of greenfield projects could adversely affect our results of operations 
our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general economic and capital market conditions  the availability of bank credit  investor confidence  the financial condition  performance  prospects and credit rating of our company in general and or that of our subsidiary requiring the financing  and changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital 
should future access to capital not be available  we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or acquire existing facilities 
while a decision not to build new plants or acquire existing facilities would not affect the results of operations of our currently operating facilities or facilities under construction  such a decision would affect our future growth 
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our operating performance or cost structure 
we are in the business of generating and distributing electricity  which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance  including changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages  equipment failure  labor disputes  disruptions in fuel supply  inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires  floods  storms  hurricanes  earthquakes  explosions  terrorist acts or other similar occurrences  and changes in our operating cost structure  including  but not limited to  increases in costs relating to gas  coal  oil and other fuel  fuel transportation  purchased electricity  operations  maintenance and repair  environmental compliance  including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment  transmission access  and insurance 
any of the above risks could adversely affect our business and results of operations  and our ability to meet our publicly announced projections or analysts expectations 
we are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes 
we operate a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses in countries and  therefore  we are subject to significant and diverse government regulation 
our inability to predict  influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes  including our inability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses  could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet our publicly announced projections or analyst s expectations 
furthermore  changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate  particularly our regulated utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval  could adversely affect our business  including  but not limited to changes in the determination  definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass through costs  changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non controllable costs  changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium  changes in the timing of tariff increases  or other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions 
our businesses  particularly our businesses in our competitive supply segment  may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets 
our generation businesses  especially our businesses in the competitive supply segment  sell electricity in the wholesale spot markets 
our regulated utility businesses  and to the extent they require additional capacity our generations businesses  also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets 
as a result  we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets 
the open market wholesale prices for electricity are very volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of coal  natural gas  or oil 
consequently  any changes in the supply and cost of coal  natural gas  and oil may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity 
a significant percentage of our generation facilities  particularly the facilities in our competitive supply segment  operate wholly or partially without long term power sales agreements 
as a result  power from these facilities is sold on the spot market or on a short term contractual basis  which if not fully hedged may affect the volatility of our financial results 
in addition  our business depends upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others  if transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable  our ability to sell and deliver our wholesale power may be limited 
volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things weather conditions  seasonality  electricity usage  illiquid markets  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources  demand for energy commodities  available supplies of natural gas  crude oil and refined products  and coal  generating unit performance  natural disasters  terrorism  wars  embargoes and other catastrophic events  federal and state energy and environmental regulation  legislation and policies  geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas  and general economic conditions in areas where we generate which impact energy consumption 
we are a holding company and our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness at the parent company level is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries by way of dividends  fees  interest  loans  or otherwise 
the aes corporation is a holding company with no material assets  other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
all of our revenue generating operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
accordingly  almost all of our cash flow is generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and  unless they have expressly guaranteed any of our indebtedness  have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts due pursuant to our debt or to make any funds available therefore  whether by dividends  fees  loans or other payments 
while some of our subsidiaries guarantee our indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility and certain other indebtedness  none of our subsidiaries guarantee  or is otherwise obligated with respect to  our outstanding public debt securities 
accordingly  our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our other obligations at the parent company level is dependent not only on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate cash  but also on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us in the form of dividends  fees  interest  loans or otherwise 
most of our subsidiaries are obligated  pursuant to loan agreements  indentures or project financing arrangements  to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to us 
in addition  the payment of dividends or the making of loans  advances or other payments to us may be subject to legal or regulatory restrictions 
our subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to us as a result of restrictions imposed by the foreign government on repatriating funds or converting currencies 
any right we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation  dissolution  winding up  receivership  reorganization  assignment for the benefit of creditors  marshaling of assets and liabilities or any bankruptcy  insolvency or similar proceedings and the consequent right of the holders of our indebtedness to participate in the distribution of  or to realize proceeds from  those assets will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary s creditors including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary 
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund greenfield projects in certain less developed economies 
commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non recourse project financing including financial guarantees in certain less developed economies  thus we have sought and will continue to seek  in such locations  direct or indirect through credit support or guarantees project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies 
as a precondition to making such project financing available  these institutions may also require governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks 
depending on the policies of specific governments  such guarantees may not be offered and as a result  we may determine that sufficient financing will ultimately not be available to fund the related project 
in addition  we are frequently required to provide more sponsor equity for projects that sell their electricity into the merchant market than for projects that sell their electricity under long term contracts 
a downgrade in our or our subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow 
from time to time we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows 
if any of our or our subsidiaries credit ratings were to be downgraded  our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs would increase 
furthermore  as a result of the aes corporation s credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities  counter parties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by the aes corporation to provide credit support 
accordingly  with respect to both new and existing commitments  the aes corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance  such as a letter of credit  to backstop or replace any credit support by the aes corporation 
we cannot provide assurance that such counter parties will accept such guarantees in the future 
in addition  to the extent the aes corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties  it will limit the amount of credit available to the aes corporation to meet its other liquidity needs 
our generation business in the united states is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the ferc  including the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa and the federal power act 
the recently enacted energy policy act of epact made a number of changes to these and other laws that may affect our business 
actions by the ferc and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations 
epact authorizes the ferc to remove the obligation of electric utilities under section of purpa to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to qualified facilities qfs if certain market conditions are met 
pursuant to this authority the ferc has recently proposed to remove the purchase sale obligation for all utilities located within the control areas of the midwest transmission system operator  inc  pjm interconnection  llc  iso new england  inc 
and the new york independent system operator 
in addition  the ferc is authorized under the new law to remove the purchase sale obligations of individual utilities on a case by case basis 
while the new law does not affect existing contracts  as a result of the changes to purpa our qfs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long term contracts expire 
epact repealed puhca of and enacted puhca of in its place 
puhca had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities 
by comparison puhca has no such restrictions and simply provides the ferc and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies 
the repeal of puhca may spur an increased number of mergers and the creation of large  geographically dispersed utility holding companies 
these entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the us generation market 
in accordance with congressional mandates in the energy policy act of and now in epact  the ferc has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets 
increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins 
among other steps  the ferc has encouraged regional transmission organizations and independent system operators to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand 
these programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs 
similarly  the ferc is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of epact although new transmission lines may increase our market opportunities  they may also increase the competition in our existing markets 
while the ferc continues to promote competition  some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost of service basis by retail ratepayers 
such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate 
finally  epact affects nearly every aspect of the energy business and energy regulation 
we are still in the process of analyzing the new law s effects  and those effects could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings 
we and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings 
investors should review the descriptions of such matters contained in this annual report  as well as our other periodic reports we file in the future with the commission 
there can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
our business is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations 
our activities are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulation by federal  state  local authorities  international treaties and foreign governmental authorities 
these regulations generally involve emissions into the air  effluents into the water  use of water  wetlands preservation  waste disposal  endangered species  and noise regulation  among others 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions 
environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time 
congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions  particularly those involving air and water emissions 
see the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in this annual report on form k under the caption regulation matters environmental and land use regulations 
these laws and regulations have imposed  and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future  additional costs on the operation of our power plants 
we have made and will continue to make significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations 
changes in  or new  environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or exceed our estimates 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business  financial condition or results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations 
catastrophic events could adversely affect our facilities and operations 
catastrophic events such as fires  explosions  terrorist acts or natural disasters such as floods or tornadoes  or other similar occurrences could adversely affect our facilities  operations  earnings and cash flow 
our business is sensitive to variations in weather and seasonal variations 
the energy business is affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather 
we forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather  which represents a long term historical average 
significant variations from normal weather such as warmer winters and cooler summers where our business are located could have a material impact on our results of operations 
storms that interrupt our services to our customers have in the past required us  and in the future may require us  to incur significant costs to restore services 
some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions 
certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees 
of the thirteen defined benefit plans  two are at us subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries 
pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations 
any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong  resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan 
our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for funding any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan 
future downturns in the equity markets  or the failure of any of our assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries pension plan obligations to prove correct  could increase the underfunding of the pension plan 
this may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries liquidity 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates pension and postretirement obligations and footnote to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including equipment failure causing unplanned outages  failure of transmission systems  the dependence on a specified fuel source  including the transportation of fuel  or the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions including natural disasters such as hurricanes or environmental compliance any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our generation facilities 
a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago 
older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures to keep it operating at peak efficiency 
this equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement 
breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which  in certain situations  could result in termination of the agreement or incurring a liability for liquidated damages 
we may not fully hedge our exposure against changes in commodity prices 
to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity  fuel requirements and other commodities 
as part of this strategy  we routinely utilize fixed price forward physical purchase and sales contracts  futures  financial swaps  and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
however  we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price volatility  and the coverage will vary over time 
fluctuating commodity prices may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged positions 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain offices in many places around the world  generally pursuant to the provisions of long and short term leases  none of which are material 
with a few exceptions  our facilities  which are described in item of this form k  are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the project s related finance facility 
in addition  the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased 
however  in a few instances  no accompanying project financing exists for the facility  and in a few of these cases  the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate 
item legal proceedings the company is involved in certain claims  suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
the company has accrued for litigation and claims where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes  based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance coverage  that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
it is possible  however  that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the company  and could require the company to pay damages or to make expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in september  a brazilian appellate state court of minas gerais granted a temporary injunction suspending the effectiveness of a shareholders agreement between southern electric brasil participacoes  ltda 
seb and the state of minas gerais concerning cemig 
aes investment in cemig is through seb 
this shareholders agreement granted seb certain rights and powers in respect of cemig special rights 
in march  a lower state court in minas gerais held the shareholders agreement invalid where it purported to grant seb the special rights and the lower state court enjoined the exercise of special rights 
in august  the state appellate court denied an appeal of the merits decision  and extended the injunction 
in october  seb filed two appeals against the decision on the merits of the state appellate court  one appeal to the federal superior court and the other appeal to the supreme court of justice 
the state appellate court denied access of these two appeals to the higher courts  and in august  seb filed two interlocutory appeals against such decision  one directed to the federal superior court and the other to the supreme court of justice 
in december  the federal superior court declined to hear seb s appeal 
however  the supreme court of justice is considering whether to hear seb s appeal 
seb intends to vigorously pursue a restoration of the value of its investment in cemig by all legal means  however  there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts 
failure to prevail in this matter may limit seb s influence on the daily operation of cemig 
in november  the company was named in a purported class action suit along with six other defendants  alleging unlawful manipulation of the california wholesale electricity market  allegedly resulting in inflated wholesale electricity prices throughout california 
the alleged causes of action include violation of the cartwright act  the california unfair trade practices act and the california consumers legal remedies act 
in december  the case was removed from the san diego county superior court to the us district court for the southern district of california 
on july   the court remanded the case to san diego superior court 
the case was consolidated with five other lawsuits alleging similar claims against other defendants 
in march  the plaintiffs filed a new master complaint in the consolidated action  which reasserted the claims raised in the earlier action and names the company  aes redondo beach  llc  aes alamitos  llc  and aes huntington beach  llc as defendants 
in may  the case was removed by certain cross defendants from the san diego county superior court to the united states district court for the southern district of california 
the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court  which was granted on december  certain defendants appealed aspects of that decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
on december   a panel of the ninth circuit issued an opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the district court  and remanding the case to state court

on december   plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to any actions asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously against the allegations 
in august  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc announced an investigation into the organized california wholesale power markets in order to determine whether rates were just and reasonable 
further investigations involved alleged market manipulation 
the ferc requested documents from each of the aes southland plants and aes placerita 
aes southland and aes placerita have cooperated fully with the ferc investigation 
aes southland is not subject to refund liability because it did not sell into the organized spot markets due to the nature of its tolling agreement 
aes placerita is currently subject to refund liability of  for sales to the california power exchange 
the ninth circuit court of appeals addressed the appeal of the ferc s decision not to impose refunds for the alleged failure to file rates including transaction specific data for sales during and although in its order issued on september  the ninth circuit did not order refunds  the ninth circuit remanded the case to the ferc for a refund proceeding to consider remedial options 
that remand order is stayed pending rehearing at the ninth circuit 
in addition  in a separate case  the ninth circuit heard oral arguments on the time and scope of the refunds 
placerita made sales during the time period at issue in the appeals 
depending on the result of the appeals  the method of calculating refunds and the time period to which the method is applied  the alleged refunds sought from aes placerita could approximate million 
in august  the grid corporation of orissa  india gridco  filed a petition against the central electricity supply company of orissa ltd 
cesco  an affiliate of the company  with the orissa electricity regulatory commission oerc  alleging that cesco had defaulted on its obligations as an oerc licensed distribution company  that cesco management abandoned the management of cesco  and asking for interim measures of protection  including the appointment of an administrator to manage cesco 
gridco  a state owned entity  is the sole wholesale energy provider to cesco 
pursuant to the oerc s august order  the management of cesco was replaced with a government administrator who was appointed by the oerc 
the oerc later held that the company and other cesco shareholders were not necessary or proper parties to the oerc proceeding 
in august  the oerc issued a notice to cesco  the company and others giving the recipients of the notice until november to show cause why cesco s distribution license should not be revoked 
in response  cesco submitted a business plan to the oerc 
in february  the oerc issued an order rejecting the proposed business plan 
the order also stated that the cesco distribution license would be revoked if an acceptable business plan for cesco was not submitted to  and approved by  the oerc prior to march  in its april  order  the oerc revoked the cesco distribution license 
cesco has filed an appeal against the april  oerc order and that appeal remains pending in the indian courts 
in addition  gridco asserted that a comfort letter issued by the company in connection with the company s indirect investment in cesco obligates the company to provide additional financial support to cover all of cesco s financial obligations to gridco 
in december  gridco served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the indian arbitration and conciliation act of on the company  aes orissa distribution private limited aes odpl  and jyoti structures jyoti pursuant to the terms of the cesco shareholders agreement between gridco  the company  aes odpl  jyoti and cesco the cesco arbitration 
in the arbitration  gridco appears to seek approximately million in damages plus undisclosed penalties and interest  but a detailed alleged damages analysis has yet to be filed by gridco 
the company has counter claimed against gridco for damages 
an arbitration hearing with respect to liability was conducted on august  in india 
final written arguments regarding liability were submitted by the parties to the arbitral tribunal in late october a decision on liability may be issued in the near future 
a petition remains pending before the indian supreme court concerning fees of the third neutral arbitrator and the venue of future hearings with respect to the cesco arbitration 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to any actions asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously against the allegations 
in december  a petition was filed by gridco in the local india courts seeking an injunction to prohibit the company and its subsidiaries from selling their shares in orissa power generation company pvt 
ltd 
opgc  an affiliate of the company  pending the outcome of the above mentioned cesco arbitration 
opgc  located in orissa  is a mw coal based electricity generation business from which gridco is the sole off taker of electricity 
gridco obtained a temporary injunction  but the district court eventually dismissed gridco s petition for an injunction in march gridco appealed to the orissa high court  which in january allowed the appeal and granted the injunction 
the company has appealed the high court s decision to the supreme court of india 
in may  the supreme court adjourned this matter until august in august  the supreme court adjourned the matter again to await the award of the arbitral tribunal in the cesco arbitration 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to any actions asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously against the allegations 
in early  gridco made an application to the oerc requesting that the oerc initiate proceedings regarding the terms of opgc s existing power purchase agreement ppa with gridco 
in response  opgc filed a petition in the india courts to block any such oerc proceedings 
in early the orissa high court upheld the oerc s jurisdiction to initiate such proceedings as requested by gridco 
opgc appealed that high court s decision to the supreme court and sought stays of both the high court s decision and the underlying oerc proceedings regarding the ppa terms 
in april  the supreme court granted opgc s requests and ordered stays of the high court s decision and the oerc proceedings with respect to the ppa terms 
the matter is awaiting further hearing 
unless the supreme court finds in favor of opgc s appeal or otherwise prevents the oerc s proceedings regarding the ppa terms  the oerc will likely lower the tariff payable to opgc under the ppa  which would have an adverse impact on opgc s financials 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to any actions asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously against the allegations

the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our restated consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
restatement of consolidated financial statements subsequent to filing its restated annual report on form k a with the securities exchange commission on january   the company discovered its previously issued restated consolidated financial statements included certain errors in accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  minority interest expense and income taxes 
the errors in accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities resulted in differences in previously issued consolidated interim financial statements for certain quarterly periods in sufficient to require restatement of prior period interim results 
the errors in accounting for income taxes and minority interest expense required restatement of previously issued consolidated annual financial statements 
as a result of evaluating these adjustments  the company reduced its stockholders equity by million as of january  as the cumulative effect of the correction of errors for all periods proceeding january   and restated its consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended december  and and its consolidated balance sheet as of december  the restatement adjustments resulted in an increase to previously reported net income of million for the year ended december  and in a decrease to previously reported net income of million for the year ended december  there was no impact on gross margin or net cash flow from operating activities of the company for any years presented 
based upon management s review it has been determined that these errors were inadvertent and unintentional 
the errors relate to the following areas a 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company determined that it failed to perform adequate on going effectiveness testing for three interest rate cash flow hedges and one foreign currency cash flow hedge during as required by sfas no 
as a result  the company should have discontinued hedge accounting and recognized changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings prospectively from the last valid effectiveness assessment until the earlier of either the expiration of the derivative instrument or the re designation of the derivative instrument as a hedging activity 
the net impact related to the correction of these errors to previously reported net income resulted in a decrease of million and an increase of million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
b 
income tax and minority interest adjustments as a result of the company s year end closing review process  the company discovered certain other errors related to the recording of income tax liabilities and minority interest expense 
the adjustments primarily include an increase in income tax expense related to the recording of certain historical withholding tax liabilities at one of our el salvador subsidiaries  an increase in minority interest expense related to a correction of the allocation of income tax expense to minority shareholders 
this allocation pertained to certain deferred tax adjustments recorded in the original restatement at one of our brazilian generating companies 
in addition  minority interest expense was also corrected at this subsidiary as a result of identifying differences arising from a more comprehensive reconciliation of prior year statutory financial records to us gaap financial statements 
a reduction of income tax expense related to adjustments derived from income tax returns filed in the net impact related to the correction of these errors to previously reported net income resulted in an increase of million and a decrease of million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
in addition  the company restated stockholders equity as of january  by million as a correction for these errors in all periods preceding january  c 
other balance sheet reclassifications certain other balance sheet reclassifications were recorded at december  including a million reclassification which reduced accounts receivables and increased other current assets regulatory assets 
executive summary and overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our restated consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  and other information included in this report 
who are we aes is a global power company managed to meet the growing demand for electricity in ways that benefit all of our stakeholders 
aes is a holding company that through its subsidiaries and affiliates owns and operates a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses in countries 
we seek to capture the benefits of our global expertise and economies of scale in our operations 
predictable and growing cash flow  an efficient capital structure  operating and portfolio risk management  and world class operating performance are the focus of our management efforts 
what businesses are we in we operate in two principal businesses 
the first is the generation of power for sale to utilities and other wholesale customers 
the second is the operation of electric utilities which distribute power to retail  commercial  industrial and governmental customers 
our financial results are reported as three business segments  two for the generation business and one for the utility business 
our businesses may be significantly affected by a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors 
important factors that could affect financial results are discussed under section a  risk factors 
what are our reporting segments we report our generation business under two reporting segments  contract generation and competitive supply 
these segments together consist of approximately gigawatts of generating capacity from power plants in countries 
our contract generation businesses principally sell electricity to utilities or other wholesale customers under power purchase agreements ppa of generally five years or longer and for or more of their capacity 
these ppas are designed to provide a predictable recovery of the costs of building and operating our plants as well as generating a return on our investment 
fuel supply cost risk is often limited contractually either through contract price escalation provisions or through tolling arrangements where we convert the customer s fuel into electricity 
through these contractual agreements  the businesses generally reduce commodity and electricity price volatility and thereby increase the predictability of their gross margin  net income and cash flow 
our competitive supply businesses sell electricity to wholesale customers through competitive markets and  as a result  the cash flows and earnings of such businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price of electricity  as well as natural gas  coal and other fuels 
however  for our us competitive supply business which includes a fleet of low cost coal fired plants in new york  we typically hedge the majority of our fuel exposure on a rolling two year basis 
our regulated utilities consist of distribution companies in seven countries with approximately million end user customers 
three of these utilities  in the us  venezuela and cameroon  are integrated utilities providing both power generation and distribution 
the remaining utilities  located in brazil  el salvador  argentina  and ukraine  are solely transmission and distribution businesses 
only one of our regulated utilities  indianapolis power and light ipl  is located in the us the largest part of our utility business portfolio operates in emerging markets  where electricity demand is expected to grow at a higher rate than in more developed countries 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency  political  payment  and economic risks and significant electricity theft related losses within developing countries 
the challenge within all of these businesses is to provide dependable and quality service to a diverse customer base and achieve appropriate returns on investment through tariff increases  cost management and prudent capital investment 
in  we realigned our management reporting structure into four regions north america  latin america  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia  each led by a regional president who reports directly to the chief executive officer ceo 
this realignment allowed us to place senior leaders and resources closer to the businesses to further improve operating performance and integrate operations and development on a more localized level 
this structure will help us leverage regional market trends to enhance our competitiveness and identify and capitalize on key business development opportunities 
the organizational changes are expected to streamline some corporate functions to more effectively support aes businesses around the globe 
the company also maintains a corporate business development group which manages large scale transactions such as mergers and acquisitions  and portfolio management  as well as targeted strategic initiatives 
in addition to our primary business of operating a global power portfolio  we are engaged in exploring and promoting a set of related activities that include alternative energy businesses such as wind generation  the supply of liquefied natural gas to certain targeted north american markets  the production of greenhouse gas reduction activities and new energy technologies 
at present  these initiatives represent growth opportunities for us but currently account for a de minimus amount of revenue and earnings 
what did we focus on in in  we focused on global operational excellence  deleveraging and credit improvement  and our growth strategies 
our operational focus included a safety  b plant and distribution system operational excellence and c customer service 
our deleveraging and credit improvement focus included a paying down billion in debt  including million at the parent company  b extending maturities of subsidiary debt  c improving parent liquidity  and d gaining improved parent and subsidiary credit quality and ratings 
it was also a year to rebuild our growth development pipeline under a new organization structure implemented midyear 
we completed the restatement of our prior year form k and are continuing to develop and implement action plans to address the material weaknesses within our financial reporting processes 
how did we do revenue we achieved record revenues in of billion  an increase of from billion last year 
favorable foreign currency trends and higher prices led the increase 
gross margin gross margin increased to billion  driven by the higher revenues 
net cash from operating activities our cash flow increased to billion  driven by higher net earnings adjusted for non cash items  an increase in other assets net of other liabilities  and a decrease in working capital 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to in from in higher revenue and gross margin  together with favorable foreign currency transaction effects led the improvement 
what was the restatement about at the end of  the company identified a material weakness related to its accounting for deferred income taxes and embarked upon a global process to document the deferred income tax calculations and to perform more detailed reconciliations at its foreign subsidiaries 
in july the company determined that errors found during that process required a restatement  which was completed in january the restatement required that the company re file its form k and its previously issued form q for the first quarter of the most significant adjustments involved areas of accounting that required a high degree of interpretation and or judgment involving transactions which occurred during and prior to management concluded that all errors were both inadvertent and unintentional 
the income tax restatement errors identified primarily relate to the calculation of deferred income taxes related to certain purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions  the correct application of foreign currency translation of certain deferred income tax balances  and the correction of other income tax accounts related to a review and reconciliation of prior year income tax returns 
as a result of extended review procedures  certain other adjustments related to the classification of cash versus short term investments  consolidation  acquisition and translation accounting and revenue deferrals related to a brazilian energy efficiency program  were identified and corrected 
in addition  subsequent to the filing of the company s restated financial statements as described above  the company identified certain other errors which led us to restate our and year end numbers and the quarterly periods for these adjustments related largely to the correction of income tax expense and minority interest expense upon additional year end review of certain calculations performed during the earlier restatement process 
additionally  we identified certain derivative adjustments related to the proper documentation and treatment of a cash flow foreign currency hedge and cash flow interest rate hedges at certain of our foreign businesses 
how are we addressing our material weaknesses as of december   the company reported material weaknesses related to the following areas accounting for income taxes  an aggregation of control deficiencies at our cameroonian subsidiary  a lack of us gaap expertise and review in our brazilian businesses  the treatment of intercompany loans denominated in other than the functional currency  and  accounting for derivatives 
management  the audit committee and our board of directors are committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses and the continued improvement of the company s overall system of internal control over financial reporting 
over the last several years  in recognition of the decentralized and complex nature of our organization  management  the audit committee and the board of directors have taken steps to improve the quality of the people  processes and systems within the company s income tax  accounting  financial reporting  internal control  compliance and internal audit functions 
this included creating several new corporate leadership positions as well as adding staffing to these functions 
in response to the material weaknesses reported as of december   management has developed remediation plans for each of the weaknesses and is undergoing continued efforts to strengthen the existing finance organization and systems across the company 
these efforts include the reorganization of the company wide accounting and tax functions to align the local business finance functions with teams at the corporate office 
in addition  the company is continuing to further expand the number of accounting and tax personnel at the corporate office who will provide technical support and oversight of our global financial processes  as well as adding additional finance resources to our subsidiaries 
this accelerated hiring effort began in february  and  once completed  is expected to result in approximately additional personnel within the corporate finance organization as well as additional personnel at our subsidiaries  particularly those subsidiaries where material weaknesses were found 
while the recruiting and reorganization effort is underway  the company will continue to use third parties to provide assistance in the performance of relevant accounting and tax procedures  as well as provide assistance in the development and execution of the remediation plans 
in its effort to develop a world class finance organization  the company is preparing a finance leadership development program  in partnership with an international leader in management education  that is expected to begin offering courses for our finance professionals in june in addition  various levels of training programs on specific aspects of us gaap are being developed for distribution to our subsidiaries during in march  the company completed its first in depth training related to accounting for income taxes  with participation from approximately aes professionals from our corporate office  domestic  and international subsidiaries 
while the company continues to refine and execute its remediation efforts  it will utilize additional resources to assist in the program management aspect of each material weakness remediation plan and has committed to provide status reports to our external auditors and our audit committee of the board of directors on a monthly basis throughout what key growth projects are underway our largest growth project under construction remains a  mw gas fired power plant in cartagena  spain 
this project is scheduled for completion in  and will provide power under long term contract to gaz de france which will sell into the spanish merchant power market 
other important growth projects under construction include mw diesel fired peaking facility to serve the largest power market in chile  and a mw wind farm project in texas 
both of these projects are scheduled to be on line in as well 
in addition  a multi pollution control project is under construction at our greenidge coal fired plant in new york  which will extend the useful life of the project and allow for more economical power dispatch and the generation of additional air emission allowances  both leading to increased revenues 
we also secured a year ppa and matching fuel supply agreement  together with construction and long term financing for a new mw gross lignite fired power plant near galabovo  bulgaria 
this project is in final engineering and permitting stages and is expected to enter construction in the spring of  with start up planned in two phases in and we have also secured a year ppa for a new mw hydro electric power plant in panama 
aes has begun the engineering and geo technical work and plans to begin construction in the plant is scheduled to be operational by how are we positioning for growth aes s strategy for growing its business involves utilizing a local management structure operating in local markets 
aes believes this is the best method for identifying and capitalizing on growth opportunities 
these opportunities generally happen in a variety of ways i through platform expansions  which are investment opportunities in existing businesses or existing country markets  ii greenfield development  which typically means development and construction of a new facility  and iii privatizations  which involves the transfer of government owned generation and distribution systems in the private sector 
these opportunities are pursued by the company s regional organizations 
these efforts are supplemented by targeted mergers and acquisitions  which can be on an individual basis or involve more complex portfolios 
these efforts are led by the company s corporate business development group  acting in conjunction with the appropriate regional organization 
our active development pipeline of potential growth investments includes opportunities in countries 
we have assessed country financial and operating risks in prioritizing those countries in which we would like to make investments  and look to develop a balanced geographic portfolio over time with increased presence in eastern europe and asia in particular 
we continue to devote significant resources at both the corporate and business level in support of these opportunities and are funding development related costs which could lead to significant new investments in and in future years 
we signed a memorandum of understanding in to develop a  mw coal fired power plant in vietnam in partnership with a vietnamese coal producer 
these agreements may or may not lead to a firm project  but provide the basis for improving the potential for a successful project  especially if the agreement is entered into on an exclusive basis 
we continue to develop wind generation opportunities  a market we entered early in we quickly became a significant player in the us  with responsibility for the operation of mw of wind facilities and  mw of wind projects in development 
we also continue to develop stand alone lng regasification facilities  and have started development of two new projects on the us east cost during the year 
our proposed bahamas lng regasification terminal and mile natural gas pipeline from the terminal to serve south florida  awaits final bahamian government approval 
the global power market is extremely large and offers multiple opportunities 
in the european union eu  the market rules require a liberalized competitive wholesale power market as a condition for eu entry 
however  there are a number of considerations that may limit the number of available near term opportunities in other markets 
first  in the united states and  to a lesser extent  western europe there is limited need for new capacity  reducing the number of available greenfield opportunities in the most stable markets 
many states in the united states have slowed or reversed their trends towards liberalization  thereby reducing the number of available opportunities 
internationally  some planned privatization programs have been deferred for specific local reasons 
in some of the markets outside of the united states that are liberalizing the rules  those rules are being designed such that the risks are too great to justify the level of returns currently available 
hence we have decided to either not participate in those markets or to only do so in a limited manner and wait for a more balanced set of rules or regulations to emerge 
an adjunct part of our growth strategies is portfolio management 
high valuations placed on generation assets in particular  which is noted below as a challenge to our growth strategies  is also an opportunity to monetize investments or a portion of one or more of our businesses where we see the marketplace placing a significantly higher value on assets than what our own valuation shows 
we would likely use proceeds from such portfolio management transaction to fund new growth investments 
the company expects to fund these investments from our cash flows from operations and or the proceeds from our issuance of debt  common stock  other securities and asset sales 
we see sufficient value creating growth investment opportunities that may exceed available cash and cash flow from operations in future periods 
what are our key challenges there are several challenges we face in achieving our plans for and beyond 
global competition we have seen increased global competition in our markets 
in the united states and europe multiple new financial sponsors are aggressively acquiring assets 
internationally  a number of new  regionally focused and aggressive competitors have emerged 
this increased competition has led to an increase in the prices for assets in both secondary asset sales and privatizations 
prices for materials and engineering and construction services are increasing  and there is a limited supply of certain key equipment components  especially in the wind generation marketplace  which may limit our ability to secure growth opportunities or achieve acceptable returns 
foreign currency risk a significant majority of our business portfolio is located outside of the us and therefore usually subject to both currency translation and transaction risk 
our financial position and results of operations have been affected in the past by significant fluctuations in the value of the argentine peso  brazilian real and venezuelan bolivar relative to the us dollar 
we hedge certain transaction exposures principally related to debt  and have restructured debt into local currency denomination to minimize risk when possible 
although these actions may have mitigated negative impacts in certain cases  movements within currencies are difficult to predict and continue to have a significant impact on our financial results 
political environment several of our businesses operate in politically unstable environments 
the impact of governmental change and uncertainty impacts foreign currency volatility  our ability to maintain or attract needed financing  as well as our ability to effectively recover costs through routine tariff or regulatory reset proceedings 
regulatory risk due to the regulated nature of the utilities business  we are subject to regulatory risk related to changes in tariff agreements  and existing laws and provisions 
changes in regulation may impact our future operations  cash flows and financial condition 
long term contracts several of our power generation plants operate on a long term contract basis with one or a limited number of contracts related to both the fuel supply and power demand 
the remaining periods for these long term contracts range from to years 
the ability of our customers and suppliers to perform under these contracts and our ability to negotiate new contracts upon expiration may have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future 
performance improvement although we continue to place significant effort on performance improvement initiatives  it remains difficult to measure the financial impact of such initiatives in our financial results  and the reported impact has not been significant in comparison to other important business drivers such as price  volume  and foreign currency movements 
in addition  benefits from global sourcing include avoided costs  reduction in actual versus originally estimated capital project costs  and projected savings on assumed spend volume which may or may not actually be achieved 
these benefits will not be fully reflected in our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
looking ahead what is our key focus for our focus in will be in several key areas  starting with safety  by building on two years of improvement in both lower lost workday cases and in reporting of accidents and near misses 
operational excellence will also continue to drive for improvements in both the generation and utility businesses 
in addition  management is committed to the remediation of our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as well as the continued improvement of the company s overall system of internal controls 
the company also will continue to strengthen its training and development programs for aes people at all levels 
we will continue to pursue growth opportunities  including platform expansion  greenfield projects  privatization and mergers and acquisitions  as well as our strategic initiatives in alternative energy businesses such as wind generation  lng  and climate change 
as we see an increase in projects under construction  we look to further strengthen our ability to manage and execute multiple construction projects 
we want to ensure all the appropriate policies  work procedures  and accountability is in place to execute transactions with proper financial controls and tax and accounting determinations 
to take advantage of these opportunities we intend to leverage our existing strengths and capitalize on favorable market conditions to deliver higher earnings and cash flow and improved credit quality 
the catalysts to further growth  consistent with appropriate risk reward profiles  include both external and internal factors such as continued electricity demand growth in key markets  attraction of private and public capital for emerging markets  government policies that encourage the development of new areas of opportunity  including renewable energy  and experience with related areas that can lead to business opportunities such as lng regasification  fossil fuel sourcing  non power markets  and air emission allowance markets 
critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of aes are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  which requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
aes s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance is based on the company s assessment of known delinquent accounts  historical experience  and other currently available evidence of the collectability and aging of accounts receivable 
there is an increased level of exposure related to the company s regulated utilities receivables in certain non us locations which are due from local municipalities and other governmental agencies 
these customers are often large and normally pay within extended timeframes 
the amount of historical experience is limited in some cases due to the recent nature of aes acquisitions subsequent to privatization 
in addition  local political and economic factors often play a part in a municipality s current ability or willingness to pay 
the company monitors these situations closely and continues to refine its reserving policy based on both historical experience and current knowledge of the related political economic environments 
income tax reserves we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years 
the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes 
tax reserves have been established  which the company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 
once established  reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves 
while the company believes that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable  it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material 
a range of these amounts cannot be reasonably estimated at december   as they are primarily unasserted claims 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
the company conducted an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision in accordance with recently issued treasury department guidance 
as a result  the company elected not to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  and assets to be disposed of when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets meet the held for sale criteria under sfas no 
these events or circumstances may include the relative pricing of wholesale electricity by region and the anticipated demand and cost of fuel 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
for regulated assets  an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset  if rate recovery was probable 
for non regulated assets  an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge against earnings 
the fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than a forced or liquidation sale 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for measurement  if available 
in the absence of quoted market prices for identical or similar assets in active markets  fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other indicators of fair value such as bids received  comparable sales or independent appraisals 
in connection with the periodic evaluation of long lived assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions would have been used in our applied valuation techniques 
in cases of impairment described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  we made our best estimate of fair value using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time 
we have been in the process of divesting certain assets and their sales values can vary from the recorded fair value as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
fluctuations in realized sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including differences in subsequent market conditions  the level of bidder interest  timing and terms of the transactions  and management s analysis of the benefits of the transaction 
goodwill we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter 
we also review the carrying value of our goodwill periodically when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of fair value and includes discounted future cash flows 
if the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded 
pension and postretirement obligations certain of our foreign and domestic subsidiaries maintain defined benefit pension plans which we refer to as the pension plans  or the plans  covering substantially all of their respective employees 
pension benefits are generally based on years of credited service  age of the participant and average earnings 
of the twenty one defined benefit pension plans existing at december   two exist at domestic subsidiaries and the remainder exists at foreign subsidiaries 
the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates salary growth retirement rates inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
sensitivity of our pension funded status and stockholders equity to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption is shown below 
although not an estimate  we ve also included sensitivity around the actual return on pension assets 
note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric  and are specific to the base conditions at year end they also may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the december  funded status is affected by december  assumptions 
pension expense for is affected by december  assumptions 
the impact on our funded status  equity and us pension expense from a one percentage point change in these assumptions is shown below in millions increase of in the discount rate decrease of in the discount rate increase of in the long term rate of return on plan assets decrease of in the long term rate of return on plan assets regulatory assets and liabilities the company accounts for certain of its regulated operations under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
as a result  aes records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes  recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks 
we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate  commodity  and foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met 
income and expense related to derivative instruments are recorded in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability 
sfas no 
enables companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged 
these hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as  and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge  are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as  and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur 
any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately 
for all hedge contracts  the company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with sfas no 
if we deem that the derivative is not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively 
as a result of uncertainty  complexity and judgment  accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions 
as a part of accounting for these derivatives  we make estimates concerning volatilities  market liquidity  future commodity prices  interest rates  credit ratings  and exchange rates 
aes generally uses quoted exchange prices to the extent they are available to determine the fair value of derivatives 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices  we seek indicative price information from external sources  including broker quotes and industry publications 
if pricing information from external sources is not available  aes will estimate prices  when possible  based on available historical and near term future price information as well as utilizing statistical methods 
when external valuation models are not available  the company utilizes internal models for valuation 
for individual contracts  the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value 
for cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions  aes must estimate the future cash flows represented by the forecasted transactions  as well as evaluate the probability of occurrence and timing of such transactions 
changes in conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events could require discontinuance of hedge accounting or could affect the timing for the reclassification of gains or losses on cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss aoci into earnings 
new accounting pronouncements consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no

sfas r eliminates the intrinsic value method as an alternative method of accounting for stock based awards under accounting principles board apb no 
by requiring that all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options for all outstanding years  be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
it also revises the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities  forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarifies the guidance under sfas no 
related to measurement of fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation to reporting periods

conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
specifically  fin provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when the timing and or method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company s asset retirement obligations covered by fin primarily include conditional obligations to demolish assets or return assets in good working condition at the end of the contractual or concession term  and for the removal of equipment containing asbestos and other contaminants 
as of december   the company recorded additional asset retirement obligations in the amount of million as a result of the implementation of fin the cumulative effect of the initial application of this interpretation was recognized as a change in accounting principle in the amount of million  net of income tax benefit of million 
the pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share resulting from the adoption of fin for the years ended december   and  is not materially different from the actual amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for those periods

accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the cumulative effect of the initial application of this interpretation was recognized as a change in accounting principle in the amount of million  net of income tax benefit of million in on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which requires companies to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the items that are part of the scope of sfas no 
for our business primarily include active ash landfills  water treatment basins and the removal or dismantlement of certain plant and equipment 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a cumulative reduction to income of million  net of income tax effects  in on october   we adopted derivative implementation group dig issue c which superseded and clarified dig issue c regarding the treatment of power sales contracts 
as a result of this adoption  we had a power purchase agreement ppa that was previously treated as a normal sales and purchase contract that was treated as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
and marked to market upon adoption of dig issue c the prospective method of accounting for this ppa requires no further mark to market treatment  and the initial mark to market adjustment will be subsequently amortized over the life of the contract 
the adoption of dig issue c  effective october  resulted in a cumulative increase to income of million  net of income tax effects  in capital resources and liquidity overview we are a holding company that conducts all of our operations through subsidiaries 
we have  to the extent achievable  utilized non recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants  distribution companies and related assets 
this type of financing is non recourse to other subsidiaries and affiliates and to us as parent company  and is generally secured by the capital stock  physical assets  contracts and cash flow of the related subsidiary or affiliate 
at december   we had billion of recourse debt and billion of non recourse debt outstanding 
for more information on our long term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k a 
in addition to the non recourse debt  if available  we  as the parent company  provide a portion  or in certain instances all  of the remaining long term financing or credit required to fund development  construction or acquisition 
these investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or loans  which are subordinated to the project s non recourse loans 
we generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations and or the proceeds from our issuances of debt  common stock  and other securities as well as proceeds from the sales of assets 
for example in march  aes sold its interest in kingston for million 
similarly  in certain of our businesses  we may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of lenders or counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity with our subsidiaries 
in such circumstances  if a subsidiary defaults on its payment or supply obligation  we will be responsible for the subsidiary s obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support 
we intend to continue to seek where possible non recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop  construct or acquire 
however  depending on market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses  non recourse debt may not be available or available on economically attractive terms 
if we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary that is under construction or has near term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non recourse debt  such subsidiary may become insolvent and we may lose our investment in such subsidiary 
additionally  if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer  the subsidiary may need to restructure the non recourse debt financing 
if such subsidiary is unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non recourse debt  we may lose our investment in such subsidiary 
as a result of aes parent s below investment grade rating  counter parties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support 
accordingly  with respect to both new and existing commitments  we may be required to provide some other form of assurance  such as a letter of credit  to backstop or replace our credit support 
we may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counter parties 
in addition  to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties  this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs 
at december   we had provided outstanding financial and performance related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our subsidiaries  which were limited by the terms of the agreements  in an aggregate of approximately million including those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below 
management believes that cash on hand  along with cash generated through operations  and our financing availability will be sufficient to fund normal operations  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and subsidiary operations 
all of these letters of credit were provided under our revolver 
we pay letter of credit fees ranging from to per annum on the outstanding amounts 
in addition  we had million in surety bonds outstanding at december  many of our subsidiaries including those in central and south america depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs 
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms  to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may adversely affect those subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses in brazil and venezuela 
capital expenditures we spent billion  billion and billion on capital expenditures in  and  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures during to approximate between billion and billion 
planned capital expenditures include new project construction costs  environmental pollution control construction and expenditures for existing assets to increase their useful lives 
capital expenditures for are expected to be financed using internally generated cash provided by operations and project level financing and possibly debt or equity financing at the aes parent company 
cash flows at december   we had  million of cash and cash equivalents representing an increase of million from december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled  million during  which was million greater than due to a million increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash items  a million increase in other assets and liabilities  and a decrease in working capital of million 
the million increase in adjustments to net income loss from  million in to  million in is primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization  minority interest expense and a loss on discontinued operations in which did not occur in these increases were offset by decreases in the provision for deferred taxes and realized gains on investments in venezuela and brazil 
there was a gain on the sale of emission allowances in new york and additional amortization of deferred financing costs due to new debt issuances 
in addition  there was a reversal of a contingent liability in at brazil due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
the million increase in other assets and liabilities is primarily due to an increase in derivative liabilities  a decrease in a long term receivable due to a reserve adjustment made in brazil  and movements in regulatory liabilities 
regulatory liabilities increased due to lower costs than anticipated in the tariff as well as the market performance of the dollar 
these increases were partially offset by settlement proceeds gener received in the million decrease in working capital is due increases in inventory and accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by decreases in accounts receivable prepaid expenses and other current assets 
change in millions decrease increase in accounts receivable increase in inventory decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets increase decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities total working capital accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to enhanced collection efforts at eletropaulo and ras laffan  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable at our new york plant due to higher energy prices 
inventory increased in the current year due to the resumption of normal activity in the dominican republic in the current year after a period of inactivity in the prior year  an increase in the price of coal at ipalco and an increase in the purchase of fuel at tisza offset by a reduction of inventory at alicura 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased due to greater amortization of regulatory assets at eletropaulo as the pass through costs are collected from the customers and lower vat accruals at cartagena for contractor invoices partially offset by higher year end purchase levels at sonel 
accounts payable and other liabilities declined in the current year mainly due to payments to ras laffan contractors  a reduction in payables to suppliers at sonel and more timely payments at barka 
in addition  tax liabilities were reduced at ipalco and other subsidiaries in the prior year due to our tax restatement 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million during compared to  million during the cash used in investing activities includes  million for property additions and million for acquisitions 
this was offset by the proceeds from the sales of assets of million  the proceeds from the sale of emission allowances of million  the net sale of short term investments of million and a decrease in restricted cash  debt service reserves and other assets and other investing of million 
property additions increased million during as compared to due to additional expenditures of million at cartagena  our construction project in spain  million for buffalo gap  our wind power project in texas  and million in brazil for the purchase and capitalized costs associated with the implementation of the enterprise resource planning software 
offsetting the increase in property additions is decreased spending of million at ras laffan in qatar due to large capital expenditures incurred prior to going into commercial operations at the end of the increase in property additions is also offset by a reduction in spending on environmental compliance projects of approximately million at ipalco in the us in the first quarter of  we spent a total of million related to the purchase of the seawest wind development business in the us  including million for the existing net assets of the business and an additional million advance payment for pre construction costs for seawest s development of buffalo gap 
the increase in the net sales of short term investments of million during as compared to was primarily due to the release of collateral at edc in venezuela of million which was as a result of a repayment of approximately million of related debt 
this increase was offset by a decrease in sales of short term investments at gener of million due to higher liquidations in the prior year to repay debt 
the decrease in the net proceeds from the sale of assets of million during as compared to was primarily due to the sale in the prior year of the nacimiento power plant at gener for million  the sale of discontinued businesses primarily mountainview in for million  net of expenses  as well as the sale of a substation property at ipalco for million in these decreases were partially offset by increases at brazil 
the change in restricted cash balances decreased million during as compared to primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash of million at ras laffan for construction payments made to the contractor  of million at edc for the release of restricted cash associated with letters of credit which were paid in september  of million due to debt related repayments at gener and of million due to debt related repayments at ebute 
these decreases were offset by a million increase at the new york plants due to increased emission sales as well as million increase at barka due to major maintenance on their gas turbines planned for the change in debt service reserves and other assets decreased million in as compared to primarily due to the payment of million of construction costs from a reserve account related to our cartagena construction project in spain  offset by an increase of million in debt service reserves at our ebute plant in nigeria required to satisfy the debt requirements on million of financing 
the change in other investing balances decreased million primarily due to the collection of a receivable for a minority interest buyout in our contract generation segment in asia 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was  million for the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the significant change was due to a decrease in debt  net of issuances  of  million in versus million in debt issuances decreased by  million during the twelve months ended december  primarily due to parent company recourse debt issuances of million in compared to million in the remaining decreases were attributable to our subsidiaries 
at gener in chile  there were bond issuances of approximately million in and other debt refinancings of approximately million during compared to million in the current year 
at cartagena in spain  there was a million decrease over the prior year in project debt financing 
at edc in venezuela  there was a decrease of million over the prior year at edc due to the issuance of debt in local currency in as part of its debt restructuring 
these reductions in debt issuances were offset by increased borrowings at eletropaulo of million 
brazil issued a million us dollar equivalent bond issuance in june  million and million of debentures in september and december  respectively 
the issuances in were used to pay off higher interest bearing debt 
debt repayments during the twelve months ended december  were  million compared to  million during the same period in the decrease of approximately million was mainly due to repayment of corporate recourse debt of  million in compared to million in the payments include the redemption of all of the company s senior subordinated notes and its convertible junior subordinated debentures 
in addition  gener decreased debt repayments in by million due to the completion of their debt restructuring and refinancing that occurred during this was offset by increased debt and debenture payments at eletropaulo and tiete in brazil of million in to pay off higher interest bearing debt  increased debt repayments at andres in the dominican republic of million due to the debt restructuring in whereby the proceeds received were used to pay off short term debt  and increased debt repayments at edc in venezuela of million due to the repayment of million euro debt in march and the repayment of debt in local currency of million 
payments for deferred financing costs decreased million during the twelve months ended december  due to parent company debt issuances in the prior year that did not occur at the same level in the current year  higher deferred financing costs at gener due to the size of the debt offering in  higher deferred financing costs in at brazil due to their reprofiling of debt in  and higher deferred financing costs at ebute due to the million refinancing arrangement in september contractual obligations a summary of the company s contractual obligations  commitments and other liabilities as of december  is presented in the table below in millions

parent company liquidity because of the non recourse nature of most of our indebtedness  we believe that unconsolidated parent company liquidity is an important measure of liquidity 
our principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries  including refinancing proceeds  proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level  including borrowings under our revolving bank loan  and proceeds from asset sales 
our cash requirements at the parent company level are primarily to fund interest and preferred dividends  principal repayments of debt  acquisitions  construction commitments  other equity commitments  taxes  and parent company overhead and development costs

on march   aes entered into a million senior unsecured credit facility agreement with a maturity date of march  the credit facility is a syndicated loan and letter of credit facility lead arranged by merrill lynch 
the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes and to provide letters of credit to support aes s investment commitment as well as the underlying funding for the equity portion of its investment in aes maritza east on an intermediate term basis 
aes maritza east is a coal fired generation project that is expected to begin construction soon 
additional non recourse financing has been committed to begin construction of aes maritza east parent liquidity was as follows at december   and in millions cash and cash equivalents less cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries parent cash and cash equivalents borrowing available under revolving credit facility cash at qualified holding companies total parent liquidity 
our parent recourse debt at year end was approximately billion  billion  and billion in  and  respectively 
our contingent contractual obligations were million  million  and million at the end of  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth our parent company contingent contractual obligations as of december  contingent contractual obligations amount number of agreements exposure range for each agreement in millions guarantees letters of credit under the revolver surety bonds total we have a varied portfolio of performance related contingent contractual obligations 
amounts related to the balance sheet items represent credit enhancements made by us at the parent company level and by other third parties for the benefit of the lenders associated with the non recourse debt recorded as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur 
the risks associated with these obligations include change of control  construction cost overruns  political risk  tax indemnities  spot market power prices  supplier support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development  under construction and operating 
while we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations during or beyond that are not recorded on the balance sheet  many of the events which would give rise to such an obligation are beyond our control 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder 
while we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs through the end of  this belief is based on a number of material assumptions  including  without limitation  assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets  the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries  exchange rates  power market pool prices  and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends 
in addition  our project subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us at the parent company level is subject to certain limitations contained in project loans  governmental provisions and other agreements 
we can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
we have met our interim needs for shorter term and working capital financing at the parent company level with a revolving bank loan of million 
we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving bank loan 
various debt instruments at the parent company level  including our senior secured credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants 
the covenants provide for  among other items limitations on other indebtedness  liens  investments and guarantees  restrictions on dividends and redemptions and payments of unsecured and subordinated debt and the use of proceeds  restrictions on mergers and acquisitions  sales of assets  leases  transactions with affiliates and off balance sheet and derivative arrangements  maintenance of certain financial ratios  and timely filing of reports with sec of which we had defaults with respect to our nd and rd quarter form qs and this annual report on form k 
non recourse debt financing while the lenders under our non recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company  defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity  including  without limitation reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent level during the time period of any default  triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee  letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary  causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets  and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent level 
for example  our senior secured credit facilities and outstanding debt securities at the parent level include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries 
in addition  our revolving credit agreement at the parent level includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries 
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness 
the total debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was million at december  none of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that currently meet the applicable definition of materiality in aes s corporate debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit an acceleration under such indebtedness 
however  as a result of additional dispositions of assets  other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations  it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes parent company s outstanding debt securities 
off balance sheet arrangements in may  one of our subsidiaries acquired six electric generating plants from new york state electric and gas 
concurrently  the subsidiary sold two of the plants to an unrelated third party for million and simultaneously entered into a leasing arrangement with the unrelated party 
we have accounted for this transaction as a sale leaseback transaction with operating lease treatment 
accordingly  we have not recorded these assets on our books and we expense periodic lease payments  which amounted to million in  as incurred 
the lease obligations bear an imputed interest rate of approximately which approximates fair market value 
we are not subject to any additional liabilities or contingencies if the arrangement terminates  and we believe that the dissolution of the off balance sheet arrangement would have minimal effects on our operating cash flows 
the terms of the lease include restrictive covenants such as the maintenance of certain coverage ratios 
as of december   we fulfilled a lease requirement on the subsidiary s behalf by funding an additional liquidity account  as defined in the lease agreement  in the form of a million letter of credit  issued under our revolving bank loan 
however  the subsidiary is required to replenish or replace this letter of credit in the event it is drawn upon or requires replacement 
historically  the plants have satisfied the restrictive covenants of the lease  and there are no known trends or uncertainties that would indicate that the lease will be terminated early 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of this transaction 
ipl  a subsidiary of the company  formed ipl funding corporation ipl funding in to purchase  on a revolving basis  up to million of the retail accounts receivable and related collections of ipl 
ipl funding is not consolidated by ipl or ipalco since it meets requirements set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities to be considered a qualified special purpose entity 
ipl funding has entered into a purchase facility with unrelated parties the purchasers pursuant to which the purchasers agree to purchase from ipl funding  on a revolving basis  up to million of the receivables purchased from ipl 
during  this agreement was extended through may  as of december  and  the aggregate amount of receivables ipl has sold to ipl funding and ipl funding has sold to the purchasers pursuant to this facility was million 
accounts receivable on the company s balance sheets are stated net of the million sold 
the net cash flows between ipl and ipl funding are limited to cash payments made by ipl to ipl funding for interest charges and processing fees 
these payments totaled approximately million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
ipl retains servicing responsibilities through its role as a collection agent for the amounts due on the purchased receivables 
ipl and ipl funding provide certain indemnities to the purchasers  including indemnification in the event that there is a breach of representations and warranties made with respect to the purchased receivables 
ipl funding and ipl each have agreed to indemnify the purchasers on an after tax basis for any and all damages  losses  claims  liabilities  penalties  taxes  costs and expenses at any time imposed on or incurred by the indemnified parties arising out of or otherwise relating to the purchase agreement  subject to certain limitations as defined in purchase agreement 
the transfers of such accounts receivable from ipl to ipl funding are recorded as sales  however  no gain or loss is recorded on the sale 
under the receivables purchase facility  if ipl fails to maintain certain financial covenants regarding interest coverage and debt to capital  it would constitute a termination event 
as of december   ipl was in compliance with such covenants 
as a result of ipl s current credit rating  the facility agent has the ability to i replace ipl as the collection agent  and ii declare a lock box event 
under a lock box event or a termination event  the facility agent has the ability to require all proceeds of purchased receivables of ipl to be directed to lock box accounts within days of notifying ipl 
a termination event would also i give the facility agent the option to take control of the lock box account  and ii give the purchasers the option to discontinue the purchase of new receivables and cause all proceeds of the purchased receivables to be used to reduce the purchaser s investment and to pay other amounts owed to the purchasers and the facility agent 
this would have the effect of reducing the operating capital available to ipl by the aggregate amount of such purchased receivables currently million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview regarding market risks we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
we often utilize financial instruments and other contracts to hedge against such fluctuations 
we also utilize financial and commodity derivatives for the purpose of hedging exposures to market risk 
we generally do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risks we are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable rate debt  fixed rate debt and trust preferred securities  as well as interest rate swap and option agreements 
depending on whether a plant s capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation  we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed rate or variable rate financing 
in certain cases  we execute interest rate swap  cap and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing 
foreign exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
a key component of this risk is that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency  the us dollar 
additionally  certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in us dollars or currencies other than their own functional currencies 
primarily  we are exposed to changes in the us dollar brazilian real exchange rate  the us dollar venezuelan bolivar exchange rate and the us dollar argentine peso exchange rate 
whenever possible  these subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates 
we also use foreign currency forward and swap agreements  where possible  to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity  natural gas and coal 
although we primarily consist of businesses with long term contracts or retail sales concessions  a portion of our current and expected future revenues are derived from businesses without significant long term revenue or supply contracts 
these competitive supply businesses subject our results of operations to the volatility of electricity  coal and natural gas prices in competitive markets 
our businesses hedge certain aspects of their net open positions in the us we have used a hedging strategy  where appropriate  to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices 
the implementation of this strategy involves the use of commodity forward contracts  futures  swaps and options as well as long term supply contracts for the supply of fuel and electricity 
value at risk one approach we use to assess our risk and our subsidiaries risk is value at risk var 
var measures the potential loss in a portfolio s value due to market volatility  over a specified time horizon  stated with a specific degree of probability 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse markets and instruments 
we adopted the var approach because we feel that statistical models of risk measurement  such as var  provide an objective  independent assessment of a component of our risk exposure 
our use of var requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for expected losses  the holding period for liquidation and the treatment of risks outside the var methodology  including liquidity risk and event risk 
var  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
additionally  var represents changes in fair value and not the economic exposure to aes and its affiliates 
because of the inherent limitations of var  including those specific to analytic var  in particular the assumption that values or returns are normally distributed  we rely on var as only one component in our risk assessment process 
in addition to using var measures  we perform stress and scenario analyses to estimate the economic impact of market changes to our portfolio of businesses 
we use these results to complement the var methodology 
in addition  the relevance of the var described herein as a measure of economic risk is limited and needs to be considered in light of the underlying business structure 
the interest rate component of var is due to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps 
these instruments themselves would expose a holder to market risk  however  utilizing these fixed rate debt instruments as part of a fixed price contract generation business mitigates the overall exposure to interest rates 
similarly  our foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments are often part of businesses which have revenues denominated in the same currency  thus offsetting the exposure 
we have performed a company wide var analysis of all of our material financial assets  liabilities and derivative instruments 
the var calculation incorporates numerous variables that could impact the fair value of our instruments  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices  as well as correlation within and across these variables 
we express analytic var herein as a dollar amount of the potential loss in the fair value of our portfolio based on a confidence level and a one day holding period 
our commodity analysis is an analytic var utilizing a variance covariance analysis within the commodity transaction management system 
during the year ended december   our average daily var for interest rate sensitive instruments was million 
the daily var for interest rate sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the second quarter  and equaled million 
the daily var for interest rate sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the first quarter  and equaled million 
these amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and the underlying hedged items 
during the year ended december   our average daily var for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was million 
the daily var for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the second quarter  and equaled million

during the year ended december   our average daily var for commodity price sensitive instruments was million 
the daily var for commodity price sensitive instruments was highest at the end of the third quarter  and equaled million 
the daily var for commodity price sensitive instruments was lowest at the end of the first quarter  and equaled million 
these amounts include the financial instruments that serve as hedges and do not include the underlying physical assets or contracts that are not permitted to be settled in cash 
trending daily var can provide insight into market volatility or consistency of a company s financial strategy
