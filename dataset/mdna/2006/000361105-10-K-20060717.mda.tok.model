general overview we report our activities in four business segments aviation supply chain  maintenance  repair and overhaul  structures and systems  and aircraft sales and leasing 
in connection with filing our fiscal year form k  we re named our reportable segments and changed the composition of some of the businesses within these segments 
the changes to our reportable segments were necessary to align our reportable segments consistent with the way our chief executive officer evaluates performance and the way we are internally organized 
we believe these changes provide enhanced transparency to our airframe maintenance activities  which are becoming a more significant part of our business as a result of our occupancy of an airframe maintenance facility in indianapolis  indiana 
further  it combines the performance of our aircraft component repair business with our parts distribution  program and logistics businesses  which is consistent with how we present these products and services to the marketplace 
we changed the name of our manufacturing segment to structures and systems  which better defines the products and services offered by this segment of our company 
all prior segment information has been restated to conform with the current composition of our reportable segments  which was adopted effective may  sales in the aviation supply chain segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new  overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to the commercial aviation and defense markets  as well as the repair and overhaul of a wide range of commercial and military aircraft airframe parts 
we also provide customized inventory supply and management programs and performance based logistics programs for engine and airframe parts and components 
sales also include the sale and lease of commercial jet engines 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product primarily aircraft and engine parts  direct labor and overhead primarily indirect labor  facility cost and insurance 
sales in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment are principally derived from aircraft maintenance and storage and the repair and overhaul of most commercial landing gear types 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product primarily replacement aircraft parts  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the structures and systems segment are derived from the manufacture and sale of containers  pallets and shelters used to support the us military s tactical deployment requirements  in plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and composite products for aerospace and industrial use 
sales in this segment are also derived from the repair  overhaul and sale of parts for industrial gas and steam turbine operators and certain military engines 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product  direct labor and overhead 
sales in the aircraft sales and leasing segment are derived from the sale and lease of commercial aircraft and technical and advisory services 
cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product aircraft  labor and the cost of lease revenue primarily depreciation  lease expense and insurance 
our chief operating decision making officer chief executive officer evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure 
the tables below set forth consolidated sales and gross profit for our four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended may for the year ended may  sales aviation supply chain maintenance  repair and overhaul structures and systems aircraft sales and leasing for the year ended may  gross profit aviation supply chain maintenance  repair and overhaul structures and systems aircraft sales and leasing business environment and trends during and  the worldwide airline industry continued to experience improvement in air traffic as available seat miles  revenue passenger miles and load factors all consistently improved 
the increase in air traffic has been driven by the recovery in the airline industry from the depressed levels experienced during fiscal and  and worldwide economic growth 
the worldwide airline industry however  continues to be negatively affected by historically high crude oil prices 
many large carriers  particularly in the united states  continue to report substantial operating losses as the surge in jet fuel prices has out paced fair hikes and the favorable impact of cost reductions 
we expect that many carriers will continue to aggressively seek ways to reduce their cost structure  including outsourcing more of their maintenance and support functions to third parties 
further  low cost carriers continue to expand their presence around the world 
many of these low cost carriers are flying newer aircraft which will result in increasing demand for maintenance and parts support in future years 
we believe we remain well positioned to respond to the market with our broad range of products and services if these trends continue to develop 
sales to the us department of defense and its contractors increased to  in fiscal  from  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in sales was driven by growing demand for performance based logistic services and increased shipments of specialized mobility products supporting our defense customers deployment activities 
although it remains difficult for us to predict future demand levels for these types of products and services  we believe we remain well positioned with our current products and services and growth plans to benefit from longer term us military deployment and program management strategies 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal increased  or over the prior year 
the increase in sales over the prior year was attributable to sales increases in the aviation supply chain  maintenance  repair and overhaul and structures and systems segments due to a increase in sales to commercial airline customers and a increase in sales to defense customers 
the increase in sales to commercial airline customers principally reflects improved demand for engine and airframe parts support due to increased passenger traffic  improved sourcing and program execution 
sales to commercial customers also increased as a result of a full year of revenue during fiscal at the indianapolis airframe maintenance facility  compared to only four full months during fiscal  as that facility commenced operations in january the increase in sales to defense customers was principally driven by continued strong demand for specialized mobility products and new performance based logistics programs 
consolidated gross profit increased  or over the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was attributable to the consolidated sales increase  as well as an improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage to from in the prior year 
sales in the aviation supply chain segment increased  or compared to the prior year 
the sales increase reflects increased demand for engine and airframe parts to commercial customers as well as an increase in sales to program customers using our supply chain management programs 
the increase in sales to defense customers served by this segment was driven by continued strong demand for parts support from existing and new performance based logistics programs 
gross profit in the aviation supply chain segment increased  or over the prior year primarily due to increased sales volume as well as an improvement in the gross profit margin percentage to from in the prior year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin percentage was attributable to effective purchasing and favorable mix of products sold 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  sales increased  or over the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to a full year of revenue at our indianapolis airframe maintenance facility during fiscal  compared with only four full months of sales during fiscal  as that facility commenced operations in january sales also increased over the prior year at our oklahoma city airframe maintenance facility and landing gear overhaul center reflecting stronger demand 
gross profit in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment increased  or over the prior year and the gross profit margin percentage improved from to  primarily due to improvements at our oklahoma city based airframe maintenance facility and the favorable impact of a full year of operations at the indianapolis airframe maintenance facility 
in the structures and systems segment  sales increased  or over the prior year as we experienced increased sales at all of our business units within the segment 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of products supporting our defense customers deployment activities due to continued strong demand and new product development  and increased demand for cargo systems and composite structure products primarily due to successful sales and marketing efforts 
gross profit in the structures and systems segment declined or compared to the prior year as the gross profit margin percentage decreased from to primarily due to the unfavorable mix of products sold 
in the aircraft sales and leasing segment  sales decreased  or compared with the prior year 
the decrease in sales is principally due to the fact that the majority of current year aircraft activity is conducted through unconsolidated joint ventures  which excludes revenues from consolidated net sales 
since september   most of the aircraft transactions we have entered into have been with joint venture partners who provide equity capital equal to our equity capital contribution 
debt is provided on a limited recourse basis by various financial institutions 
during fiscal  our joint ventures purchased aircraft bringing the total number of aircraft held in joint ventures to see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also own seven aircraft directly outside of the joint ventures 
of the seven aircraft owned by us outside the aircraft joint ventures  six were acquired prior to september  all of these aircraft are on lease at lease rates lower than pre september levels 
gross profit in the aircraft sales and leasing segment increased  or compared to the prior year 
operating income increased  or compared with the prior year due to increased gross profit  partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or primarily due to increased resources to support our growth 
net interest expense declined compared to the prior year primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher average invested cash balances during fiscal compared with the prior year 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired  aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due  or approximately of the previously outstanding principal amount  in exchange for an aggregate  newly issued shares of common stock plus  in cash  in privately negotiated transactions exempt from the registration requirements under the securities act of  as amended 
the number of shares issued was equivalent to the number into which the notes were convertible under the original terms of the notes 
we recorded  of pre tax expense on the exchange of the notes into stock in advance of the call date which was comprised of interest that the note holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive as well as an incentive payment made as part of the exchange 
also during the third quarter of fiscal  upon completion of our fiscal federal income tax return  we determined that the company qualified for additional tax benefits of  related to higher than estimated margin on fiscal export activities 
we recorded a benefit of related to fiscal export activity in the third quarter of last year 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to in the prior year 
in october of  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law and included a number of federal income tax reforms  including the phase out of tax benefits on earnings from export sales 
although increases in earnings from export sales has offset the on going phase out of this benefit for fiscal and fiscal  the benefit is eliminated effective december  and as a result  we expect our effective income tax rate will increase in fiscal income from continuing operations increased to  compared to  in the prior year due to the factors discussed above 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our engine component repair business located in windsor  connecticut  and have classified its results as discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year ended may   the loss from discontinued operations was  or per diluted share  and is comprised of the operating loss  net of tax  of and the loss on disposal  net of tax  of  net income increased to  for fiscal compared to  in the prior year due to the factors discussed above 
legal matters aar manufacturing  inc  a subsidiary of the company subsidiary received an administrative order for response activity order dated august   from the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq relating to environmental conditions at and in the vicinity of the subsidiary s cadillac  michigan plant 
the order requires the subsidiary to perform environmental investigatory work  prepare a feasibility study and a remedial action plan  and perform interim response actions 
the interim response actions include continuation of the response activities the subsidiary is performing under a consent decree  operation of a soil vapor extraction system the subsidiary had previously installed and operated  determination of the need to provide alternate water supplies to off site properties and if it is so determined then to actually provide them  removal of any free phase liquids encountered in the ground  providing notices of groundwater contamination migration to off site property owners  and other actions determined by the mdeq or the subsidiary to be appropriate 
a letter dated june  from the mdeq further demands payment of environmental response costs already incurred by the mdeq in the amount of plus interest  and reimbursement of unspecified costs to be incurred in the future by the mdeq 
the order and the letter accompanying it threaten the imposition of civil fines up to for each day of violation of the order  plus exemplary damages up to three times the costs incurred by the mdeq if the subsidiary does not comply with the order 
the order may require the implementation of the remedial action plan  although it is not clear on that point 
the order requires the implementation of emergency response action if a release of hazardous substances  threat of a release  or exacerbation of existing contamination occurs during the pendency of the order 
the subsidiary advised the mdeq that it would perform the requirements of the order to the extent those requirements apply to the allegation by the mdeq that a release of hazardous substances occurred after the execution of the consent decree 
the subsidiary declined to perform certain work required by the order that the subsidiary believes is based on claims resolved in the consent decree 
the mdeq responded to the subsidiary by saying that the mdeq will be taking appropriate action to protect public health  safety and welfare and the environment  and gain aar s compliance with part the michigan cleanup law 
the work performed under the order is in addition to the work requested to be performed as outlined above 
the subsidiary has received funds from an insurance carrier to reimburse it for a portion of the cost of work done under the consent decree 
the subsidiary sought further coverage for the matters in the june  mdeq letter and the order 
the insurance carrier denied coverage and refused to provide a defense on the basis that the work being performed is with respect to an alleged release that occurred after the execution of the consent decree 
the subsidiary has filed suit against that insurance carrier for breach of contract and other relief 
prior to the issuance of the order  the subsidiary sought a court order to enforce the consent decree  but that relief was denied by the court  primarily on the basis that the action was premature since the state was not pursuing an enforcement action at the time 
the subsidiary sought leave to appeal that decision to the michigan court of appeals  but leave was denied 
the subsidiary placed another insurance carrier on notice and that carrier is currently paying defense costs 
the work performed and data gathered by the subsidiary since the issuance of the order appears to support the positions previously taken by the subsidiary regarding the movement of groundwater in the vicinity of the subsidiary s plant and the ongoing capture of groundwater for treatment by the subsidiary 
there is disagreement with the mdeq regarding the conclusions to be drawn from the data developed from that work 
the mdeq has retained contractors to perform environmental investigations in the vicinity of the plant 
on march   a complaint was filed by the mdeq in cadillac  michigan with the wexford county circuit court 
the case is michigan department of environmental quality v aar cadillac manufacturing  a division of aar manufacturing group  inc  an illinois corporation  and aar corp  a delaware corporation  file no 
ce 
in its complaint  the mdeq seeks to enforce the order against the subsidiary and to have the court impose civil fines and exemplary damages upon the subsidiary for the alleged failure to comply with the order 
the mdeq seeks to recover its costs incurred in performing response activities approximately  from both the subsidiary and the company and seeks a declaratory judgment that both are liable for all future costs incurred by the state at the facility 
the mdeq also seeks civil fines from the subsidiary for alleged violations of a particular section of a michigan environmental law 
the subsidiary and the company are engaged with the state in mediation regarding these matters 
the company and the subsidiary filed their answer  including affirmative defenses  and intend on vigorously defending the complaint filed by the mdeq 
on june   the subsidiary also filed a petition for reimbursement of its costs in the amount of incurred in complying with the order from the state of michigan cleanup and redevelopment fund established under michigan law  plus costs and attorney fees 
as of may   the subsidiary has charged to operations approximately  related to this matter 
on january   the mdeq issued a letter of violation to the subsidiary alleging that the subsidiary failed to timely complete testing of capture and destruction efficiency of emissions at its cadillac  michigan plant 
the subsidiary negotiated a proposed administrative consent order with the mdeq air quality division to resolve the matter 
additional testing data was subsequently obtained by the subsidiary and the mdeq indicating possible additional violations 
because of that newly discovered additional data  the mdeq withdrew the proposed administrative consent order 
the mdeq has stated that it will demand that the subsidiary pay a larger settlement amount than the under the proposed administrative consent order but has not yet specified how much larger that amount will be 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales for fiscal were  which represents an increase of  or compared to fiscal in the aviation supply chain segment  fiscal sales increased  or compared to fiscal the sales increase reflects increased demand for engine and airframe parts support as a result of improved conditions in the worldwide commercial aviation industry as well as increased market penetration in europe and asia 
gross profit in the aviation supply chain segment increased  or over the prior year due to increased sales volume as well as an improvement in the gross profit margin percentage to from in the prior year 
the improvement in the gross profit margin percentage was attributable to the favorable mix of products sold 
in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment  sales increased  or compared to fiscal the sales increase is attributable to our indianapolis airframe maintenance facility which commenced operations in january gross profit in the maintenance  repair and overhaul segment was essentially flat compared with the prior year 
the gross profit margin percentage declined slightly from the prior year primarily due to start up activities at the indianapolis airframe maintenance facility 
in the structures and systems segment  sales increased  or compared to fiscal we experienced strong sales to the us department of defense for products supporting deployment activities 
we also experienced increased demand for cargo systems and composite structures primarily due to successful sales and marketing efforts 
gross profit in the structures and systems segment increased  or over the prior year due to increased sales volume 
the gross profit margin percentage declined slightly primarily as a result of mix of products sold 
in the aircraft sales and leasing segment  sales increased  or compared to fiscal the increase in sales was principally driven by the sale of our interest in certain aircraft for approximately  which was essentially equal to their book value 
gross profit in the aircraft sales and leasing segment decreased  or over the prior year primarily as a result of a pre tax charge recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the write down of an aircraft as a result of a renegotiated lease with an airline customer operating under bankruptcy protection 
operating income increased  or compared with the prior fiscal year due to the increase in gross profit  partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or primarily due to increased resources to support our growth and a pension curtailment expense recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of a change to our cash balance pension plan 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from to 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we retired  of notes payable due in december and  of convertible notes due in february the notes were repurchased for  and we charged off of related capitalized financing costs  resulting in a net gain of during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the term of a non recourse note payable was extended to november  and the outstanding principal balance was reduced by the lender in the amount of  the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of  and the net gain on the early extinguishment of the and notes are reflected in gain loss on extinguishment of debt 
interest expense declined  or due to lower overall outstanding borrowings  partially offset by of additional interest expense recorded during the first quarter of fiscal associated with a litigation settlement 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a favorable federal income tax adjustment of  as a result of the act  which included an extension of the foreign tax credit carryforward period from five years to ten years 
in previous fiscal years  we had established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  against foreign tax credits expiring in fiscal year as a result of the new ten year carryforward period established by the act  we now expect to utilize the foreign tax credits and recorded a  credit to the provision for income taxes during the second quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  upon completion of our fiscal federal income tax return  we determined the company qualified for additional tax benefits of related to higher than estimated margin on fiscal export activities 
similarly  we recorded a benefit during the third quarter of fiscal which primarily related to additional tax benefits from fiscal export activities 
income from continuing operations was  for fiscal or an increase of  over the prior year due to the factors discussed above 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our engine component repair business located in windsor  connecticut  and have classified its results as discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year ended may   the loss from discontinued operations was  or per diluted share and is comprised of the operating loss  net of tax  of and the loss on disposal  net of tax  of  net income increased to  for fiscal compared to  in the prior year due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through the generation of cash from operations  augmented by the periodic issuance of common stock and debt in the public and private markets 
in addition to these cash sources  our capital resources include secured credit arrangements  including a secured revolving credit facility and an accounts receivable securitization program 
our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the future may be negatively affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  airline and aviation industry conditions  geo political events  including the war on terrorism  and our operating performance 
our ability to use our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facility also may be negatively affected by these factors 
our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and changes in working capital 
we have a universal shelf registration on file with the securities and exchange commission under which  subject to market conditions  up to  of common stock  preferred stock or medium or long term debt securities may be issued or sold 
at may   our liquidity and capital resources included cash of  and working capital of  at may  we had  available under our accounts receivable securitization program  no accounts receivable were sold under this program as of that date 
the amount available under this agreement is based on a formula of qualifying accounts receivable 
at may   we had  available under our secured revolving credit facility  no amounts were outstanding as of this date 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility is also based on a formula of qualifying assets as well as outstanding letters of credit 
in addition to our domestic facilities  we also have  available under a foreign line of credit 
as of may   the total amount of our cash and amounts available to us under our secured credit arrangements and accounts receivable securitization program totaled  we continually evaluate various financing arrangements  including the issuance of common stock or debt  that would allow us to improve our liquidity position and finance future growth on commercially reasonable terms 
our ability to obtain additional financing is dependent upon a number of factors  including the geo political environment  general economic conditions  airline industry conditions  our operating performance and market conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets 
during the year ended may   we used  of cash from operations primarily due to an increase in our investment in equipment on long term lease of  which reflects investments made to support a new supply chain management program see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the purchase of aviation equipment that was previously subject to an operating lease 
during fiscal  there was a use of cash from inventories of  and equipment on or available for short term lease of  as we made substantial investments to support other supply chain management programs in the aviation supply chain segment and to meet growing demand for our products and services 
there also was a use of cash for accounts receivable of  primarily due to the increase in fiscal sales 
during fiscal  cash flow from operations benefited from an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and long term liabilities of  primarily as a result of increased inventory levels and long term payables associated with purchases to support a new supply chain management program  as well as net income and depreciation and amortization of  during the year ended may   our investing activities used  of cash principally reflecting capital expenditures of  and investments made in aircraft joint ventures of  we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be  to  principally reflecting increased investments across our aviation supply chain  maintenance repair and overhaul and structures and systems segments to support our growth initiatives 
we also expect to make additional investments in joint ventures during fiscal during the year ended may   our financing activities provided  of cash as a result of proceeds from the issuance of the  convertible notes and  of proceeds on the new note payable secured by a mortgage on our wood dale  illinois building see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities also benefited from the receipt of  of cash received upon the exercise of employee stock options 
during fiscal  we reduced borrowings by  which includes the  payoff of the note payable secured by a mortgage  the early retirement of notes due december  for  and other scheduled principal reductions  as well as the payment of financing costs of  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements a summary of contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of may  is as follows payments due by period due in due in due in due in due in after fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal total on balance sheet debt non recourse debt bank borrowings interest off balance sheet aviation equipment operating leases facilities and equipment operating leases garden city operating lease purchase obligations purchase obligations arise in the ordinary course of business and represent a binding commitment to acquire inventory  including raw materials  parts and components  as well as equipment to support the operations of our business 
we routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of business 
these instruments are typically issued in conjunction with insurance contracts or other business requirements 
the total of these instruments outstanding at may  was approximately critical accounting policies and significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant estimates made by management include adjustments to reduce the value of inventories and equipment on or available for lease  allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases and assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be collected 
in determining the required allowance  we consider factors such as general and industry specific economic conditions  customer credit history  and the customer s current and expected future financial performance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the specific identification  average cost or first in  first out methods 
provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions 
we have utilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories  such as historical sales of inventory  current and expected future aviation usage trends  replacement values and expected future demand 
principally as a result of the terrorist attacks of september  and its anticipated impact on the global airline industry s financial condition  fleet size and aircraft utilization  we recorded a significant charge for impaired inventories during the second quarter of fiscal utilizing those assumptions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional charge as a result of a further decline in market value for these inventories 
reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values  as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the market value of our inventories  could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
revenue recognition certain supply chain management programs that we provide to our customers contain multiple elements or deliverables  such as program and warehouse management  parts distribution and maintenance and repair services 
we recognize revenue for each element or deliverable that can be identified as a separate unit of accounting at the time of delivery based upon the relative fair value of the products and services 
in connection with these programs  we are required to make certain judgments and estimates concerning the overall profitability of the program and the relative fair value of each element of the arrangement 
differences may occur between the judgments and estimates made by management and actual program results 
equipment on or available for lease the cost of assets under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated service life of the equipment  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we are required to test for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
when applying the provisions of sfas no 
to equipment on or available for lease  we have utilized certain assumptions to estimate future undiscounted cash flows  including current and future lease rates  lease terms  residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand 
differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of aircraft and engines which are currently being leased or are available for lease 
pension plans the liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension plans are determined utilizing several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
our discount rate is determined based on a review of long term  high quality corporate bonds as of may  and models that match projected benefit payments to coupons and maturities from the high quality bonds 
the assumption for the expected long term return on plan assets is developed through analysis of historical asset returns by investment category  our fund s actual return experience and current market conditions 
changes in the discount rate and differences between expected and actual return on plan assets will impact the amount of net periodic pension expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements  foreign exchange rates and accounts receivable 
see part ii  item for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure 
during fiscal and  we did not utilize derivative financial instruments to offset these risks 
at may    was available under our secured revolving credit facility with merrill lynch capital 
interest on amounts borrowed under this credit facility is libor based 
as of may   the outstanding balance under this agreement was a hypothetical percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance during fiscal would not have had a material impact on our results of operations 
revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year  and balance sheet accounts are translated at year end exchange rates 
balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the us dollar would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
