table of contents net loss before interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as ebitda 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
consistent with regulatory requirements  ebitda includes loss from de leveraging transactions and other income 
we believe ebitda is often a useful measure of a company s operating performance and is a significant basis used by our management to measure the operating performance of our business

ebitda loss see definition and further discussion under ebitda on page subscribers subscribers subscribers are those who are receiving and have agreed to pay for our satellite audio service and or data services  either by credit card or by invoice  including those who are currently in promotional periods paid for by vehicle manufacturers  as well as xm activated radios in vehicles for which we have a contractual right to receive payment for the use of our satellite audio service and or data services 
radios that are revenue generating are counted individually as subscribers 
subscribers are the primary source of our revenues 
our target market is the over million registered vehicles and over million households in the united states 
we lead the broad market adoption of satellite radio with over million subscribers at the end of the rate of growth of our aftermarket subscriber base increases during the retail holiday seasons and with our promotional activities 
oem subscriber growth is driven primarily by the number of xm enabled vehicles manufactured and fluctuates with oem promotional activity 
oem promotional subscribers oem promotional subscribers are subscribers who have either a portion or their entire subscription fee paid for by an oem for a fixed period following the initial purchase or lease of the vehicle 
currently  at the time of sale  vehicle owners generally receive a three month prepaid trial subscription 
xm generally receives two months of the three month trial subscription from the vehicle manufacturer 
promotional periods generally include the period of trial service plus days to handle the receipt and processing of payments 
the automated activation program provides activated xm radios on dealer lots for test drives 
gm and honda generally indicate the inclusion of three months free of xm service on the window sticker of xm enabled vehicles 
under the auto activation programs  subscribers are included in our oem promotional subscriber count from the time of vehicle purchase or lease  through the period of trial service plus an additional days 
we measure the success of these promotional programs based on the percentage that elect to receive the xm service and convert to self paying subscribers after the initial promotion period 
we refer to this as the conversion rate 
we measure conversion rate three months after the period in which the trial service ends 
based on our experience it may take up to days after the trial service ends for subscribers to respond to our marketing communications 
we expect subscribers in oem promotional periods to continue to grow as a result of planned production increases of xm enabled vehicle models under existing oem partner agreements to include more models offering our service 

table of contents ending subscribers at december  increased percent compared to december  net subscriber additions include  retail includes data services   oem  and  rental cars 
retail subscribers retail ending subscribers grew percent during compared to we attribute this growth primarily to consumer appeal for the quality and diversity of our programming  our innovative radios delivered to market at attractive price points  as well as strategically increasing our points of presence in the retail channels 
we leveraged these factors with increased strategic marketing to drive our growth 
oem subscribers oem ending subscribers grew percent during compared to during  xm was available on over vehicle models  with approximately of those offered as oem factory installed options 
these figures represented an increase of over models with xm as a factory installed option from during  general motors produced its millionth vehicle with a factory installed xm radio and announced plans to manufacture million vehicles factory installed with xm in the calendar year 
in october  honda announced its plans to factory install over  of its models with xm radio  compared to the target of  xm s oem partners at the end of represented approximately percent of the us auto market 
the conversion rate for decreased slightly to percent compared to percent for primarily as a result of the april percent rate increase 
ending subscribers at december  increased percent compared to december  net subscriber additions include  retail   oem  and  rental cars

during  general motors achieved a major milestone in signing up its millionth xm subscriber 
xm s oem partners at the end of represented approximately percent of the us auto market 
the conversion rate for was percent compared to percent for the decrease in the conversion rate is due to the implementation of an automated factory activation process during the first quarter of that streamlined the radio activation process for the dealers 
the implementation of the fully automated factory activation program increased the number of subscribers originating from our oem distribution channel  but resulted in a decline in our overall conversion rate 
revenue subscription revenue subscription revenue consists primarily of our monthly subscription fees for our satellite audio service and data services charged to consumers  commercial establishments and fleets  which are recognized as the service is provided 
revenues received from vehicle manufacturers for promotional service programs are included in subscription revenue 
at the time of sale  vehicle owners generally receive a three month trial subscription and are included in oem promotional subscribers 
we generally receive payment for two months of the three month trial subscription period from the vehicle manufacturer 
our subscriber arrangements are generally cancelable without penalty 
promotions and discounts are treated as a reduction to revenue during the period of the promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of rebates to subscribers  offset subscription revenue 
discounts on equipment sold with service are allocated to equipment and service based on the relative fair values of delivered items 
subscription revenue growth is predominantly driven by the growth in our subscriber base but is affected by fluctuations in the percentage of subscribers in our various discount plans and rate changes 
additionally  the timing of subscriber additions affects comparability between years 
subscription revenue growth during was percent  due primarily to our april  percent rate increase and percent increase in subscribers  partially offset by an increase in subscribers on discount plans 
in february  we announced that effective april  we were expanding our basic service package and increasing our monthly subscription price to from 
existing customers were able to lock in a discounted rate by signing up for a pre paid plan of up to five years prior to mid april the expanded basic service now includes the internet service xm radio online previously per month and the high voltage channel previously per month  both of which were premium services prior to this change 
during  subscription revenue included million from related parties for subscription fees paid under oem promotional agreements  compared with million in 
table of contents subscription revenue growth during was primarily driven by the growth in our subscriber base 
for  subscription revenue included million from related parties for subscription fees paid under oem promotional agreements  compared with million in average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber arpu average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber is derived from the total of earned subscription revenue net of promotions and rebates divided by the monthly weighted average number of subscribers for the period reported 
average monthly revenue per subscriber is a measure of operational performance and not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber will fluctuate based on promotions  changes in our rates  as well as the adoption rate of annual and multi year prepayment plans  multi radio discount plans such as the family plan and premium services 
we expect that arpu will continue to slowly increase into as more subscribers are added and existing subscribers are converted to the new rate 
arpu increased as a result of the addition of new subscribers at the new rates as well as the transition of existing subscribers to the new rate 
the increase in the monthly subscription price is effective for all billing cycles on or after april   and therefore  will be implemented over time 
ending subscribers include  family plan subscriptions at a multi unit rate of per radio per month

revenue share royalties revenue share royalties includes performance rights obligations to composers  artists  and copyright owners for public performances of their creative works broadcast on xm  and royalties paid to radio technology providers and revenue share expenses associated with manufacturing and distribution partners and content providers 
these costs are driven by our subscriber base and broadcast content 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenue have continued to decrease from through  despite increasing in dollars 
we expect these costs to continue to increase with the growth in revenues and subscribers  and will fluctuate based on future agreements that include entering into new contracts and the renegotiation of existing contracts 
for a further discussion of license fees for music rights see above under the heading risk factors we must maintain and pay license fees for music rights  and we may have disputes with copyright holders

cost of merchandise consists primarily of the cost of radios and accessories  including hardware manufacturer subsidies  and related fulfillment costs associated with the direct sale of this merchandise 
these costs are primarily driven by the volume of radios sales  which is affected by promotional programs 
these cost increased million or percent  which was primarily the result of our fourth quarter promotional programs to compete with the launch of howard stern by our competitor 
these costs increased only slightly during as compared to satellite terrestrial satellite terrestrial includes costs related to telemetry  tracking and control of our three satellites  in orbit satellite insurance and incentive payments  satellite uplink  and all costs associated with operating our terrestrial repeater network such as power  maintenance and operating lease payments 
we expect these expenses to continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue and on an average cost per subscriber basis despite an expected increase in total costs due to the planned launch and operation of our fourth satellite as well as the expansion of our terrestrial repeater network during these costs increased million or percent  which was primarily the result of an increase in in orbit satellite insurance expense and performance incentives related to xm  which was launched in the first quarter of these costs decreased only slightly during as compared to broadcast operations broadcast and operations includes costs associated with the management and maintenance of systems and facilities as well as information technology expense

operations expenses increased million mainly due to an increase in the general operating costs associated with the newly expanded corporate facility and accompanying infrastructure 
these costs increased only slightly during as compared to programming content programming content include the creative  production and licensing costs associated with our over channels of xm original and third party content 
we view programming and content expenses as a cost of attracting and retaining subscribers 
this includes costs of programming staff and fixed payments for third party content 
these costs are primarily driven by programming initiatives 
these expenses have increased from to  and although our expenses for programming and content are not tied to subscriber counts  these expenses have varied as a percentage of revenue due to the fact that our revenue growth has surpassed our growth in expenses for programming and content 
we expect these expenses to increase in future periods as a result of programming initiatives  such as launch of oprah friends in  as well as incurring the full year of expense from other programming initiatives launched in  but to remain relatively flat on a per subscriber basis 
these costs increased million or percent and were driven primarily by costs in support of new or full year impact of programming initiatives  including major league baseball  pga tour network  xm deportivo  fox news  fox news talk  the take five women s programming channel  and the

marketing total marketing expenses consist of the direct cost to acquire a subscriber  which include subsidization to drive retail price points  distribution commissions and discretionary costs consisting of advertising and brand development 
included in total marketing expenses is the amortization of gm liability  which is relatively fixed and is not expected to change in the near future 
we expect total marketing expense to continue to increase  however  we expect the average cost to acquire a new subscriber will decrease 
subsidies distribution these direct costs include the subsidization of radios manufactured  commissions for the sale and activation of radios and certain promotional costs 
these costs are primarily driven by the volume of xm enabled vehicles manufactured  sales and activations of radios through our retail channel  and promotional activity 
we expect these costs to increase with planned production increases of xm enabled vehicles and as we increase sales of radios through our retail channels  however  we expect these costs to decrease on an average cost per new subscriber in these costs increased million or percent and were driven primarily by the percent increase in subscribers 
these costs increased million or percent and were driven primarily by the increase in subscribers  new activations  and gm vehicles equipped with xm radios 
subscriber acquisition costs subscriber acquisition costs include subsidies and distribution costs  excluding on going loyalty payments to distribution partners  and negative margins from direct sales of merchandise 
subscriber acquisition costs are divided by the appropriate per unit gross additions or units manufactured to calculate what we refer to as sac 
we expect sac to decrease in primarily as a result of a return to normal levels of subsidization and promotional activities as compared to the fourth quarter of during and  we incurred subscriber acquisition costs of million and million  respectively 
sac for and was and  respectively 
the increase in sac for as compared to is primarily the result of the increase in negative margins on direct hardware sales  subsidies and promotions during the fourth quarter of as a result of our response to control retail hardware price points to compete with the launch of howard stern by our competitor  as well as the mix of radios sold and distribution channels during the quarter 
during and  we incurred subscriber acquisition costs of million and million  respectively 
sac for and was and  respectively 
the decline in sac for as compared to is due primarily to the decline in manufacturer subsidies as a result of research and development efforts to reduce chipset costs

we achieve success in these areas through coordinated marketing campaigns that include retail advertising through various media  cooperative advertising with our retail and oem partners  sponsorships  and ongoing market research 
these costs fluctuate based on the timing of these activities 
historically  we have significant 
table of contents advertising and marketing campaigns geared towards the holiday season 
we do not expect these costs to increase substantially in the future in total dollars and expect that they will decrease as an incremental component of cpga

these costs increased million or percent and were primarily driven by increases in retail marketing and media advertising expenses 
cost per gross addition cpga cpga costs include the amounts in sac  as well as advertising and marketing  which includes advertising  media and other discretionary marketing expenses 
cpga costs do not include marketing staff included in retention support or the amortization of the gm guaranteed payments included in amortization of gm liability 
in our financial statements  sac costs are captured in subsidies distribution and the negative margins from equipment sales  while cpga costs are primarily captured by the combination of subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  plus the negative margins from equipment sales 
these costs are divided by the gross additions for the period to calculate average cpga 
we expect cpga to decrease in primarily as a result of a return to normal levels of subsidization and promotional activities as compared to the fourth quarter of during and  we incurred cpga expenses of million  and million  respectively 
average cpga for and was and  respectively 
the increase in cpga is due primarily to the fourth quarter of increase in sac  and the substantial one time increase in discretionary advertising and marketing expenses  primarily media  in response to our competitor s launch of howard stern

depreciation amortization depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenue is continuing to decrease and has decreased in dollars as well 
we expect these expenses to increase in due to the inclusion of a full year of depreciation related to xm and the addition of a partial year of depreciation based on the expected launch of xm in the second half of these costs decreased slightly primarily due to lower depreciation on xm and xm as a result of recording approximately million of insurance proceeds as a reduction to the carrying values of our satellites in august offset partially by increased depreciation related to xm which was placed into service in april as well as other additional capital expenditures 
these costs decreased million or percent and were primarily driven by decreases due to lower depreciation on xm and xm as a result of the august insurance proceeds of approximately million reducing the carrying values of our satellites in august net non operating expenses other income expense other income expense consists primarily of net costs associated with financing activities

net costs associated with financing activity costs associated with financing activities include interest income  interest expense  and de leveraging costs 
interest expense increased million  which was offset by a million increase in interest income and a million decrease in de leveraging charges 
the increase in interest expense during was primarily the result of million increase in de leveraging related costs recognized as interest expense in  million reduction in interest costs capitalized in  and the increase in interest expense associated with the million convertible senior notes due aggregate issuance in november and january the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents during for the years ended december  and  we recorded de leveraging charges of million and million to retire debt with carrying values including accrued interest of 
table of contents million and million  respectively

for the years ended december  and  we recorded de leveraging charges of million and million to retire debt with carrying values including accrued interest of million and million  respectively 
provision for deferred income taxes in  we recorded a deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived assets that are amortized and deducted for tax purposes but are not amortized under generally accepted accounting principles

our business plan is based on estimates regarding expected future costs and expected future revenue 
our costs may exceed or our revenues may fall short of our estimates  our estimates may change  and future developments may affect our estimates 
any of these factors may increase our need for funds  which would require us to seek additional financing to continue implementing our current business plan 
in addition  we may seek additional financing to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our current business plan 
we may pursue a range of different sizes or types of financing as opportunities arise  such as the sale of additional equity and debt securities 
we have and may continue to take advantage of opportunities to reduce our level of indebtedness and preferred stock in exchange for issuing common or other equity securities  if these transactions can be completed on favorable terms 
we may also take advantage of market conditions and our improving credit profile to refinance higher rate bonds and may continue de leveraging activities if we can do so on favorable terms 
in particular  we are actively considering replacing our existing  more expensive debt instruments with new lower coupon instruments to lower our overall cost of capital  and or establishing a bank revolver to provide standby liquidity  without bearing the full costs of carrying cash on our balance sheet 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the refinancing  in whole or in part 
in the event of unfavorable future developments we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in developing  implementing and marketing our satellite audio service and data services  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders 
additional financing activities could increase our level 
table of contents of indebtedness or result in further dilution to our equity holders 
if we fail to obtain necessary financing on a timely basis  a number of adverse effects could occur  or we may have to revise our business plan

table of contents increased 
we have significant annual  fixed payment obligations to gm 
as a result of the june amendment  we commenced recognizing these fixed payment obligations for the period ending through november  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
however  due to the january amendment to the distribution agreement and gm s current roll out plans which demonstrates a likelihood that gm will exceed minimum installation targets  beginning in we began recognizing these fixed payments  which approximate million  on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the contract september

we must also share with gm a percentage of the subscription revenue attributable to gm vehicles with installed xm radios  which percentage increases until there are more than million gm vehicles with installed xm radios at which point the percentage remains constant 
during the second quarter of  a clarification was agreed to by us and onstar relating to the implementation of certain aspects of revenue sharing contained within the distribution agreement 
accordingly  the revenue share expense is recognized as the related subscription revenue is earned

table of contents critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
critical accounting estimates are those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 
senior management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of estimates and assumptions for the following useful life of satellites and spacecraft control facilities following the launches of xm and xm  we extended their expected useful lives from the initial design life years to years based upon updated technical estimates from our satellite provider 
subsequently  based on degradation trends  we adjusted the estimated useful life of xm and xm down through the first quarter of or to approximately years from launch 
we continue to monitor the situation and may need to re adjust the estimated useful lives of xm and xm based on future information 
we are not recording an impairment at this time  due to our forecasted cash flows which are sufficient to recover the system assets  however  should we reduce or not meet our forecasted cash flows or reduce further the estimated useful lives of the satellites  we may be required to record an impairment which may be substantial at that time 
impairment  if any  would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows 
prior to the completion of its construction  xm was modified to correct the solar array degradation issues experienced by xm and xm  was launched in february  and is being depreciated over a useful life of years 
at december   the combined carrying value of xm  xm  and xm is million 
we have not adjusted the estimated useful lives of our spacecraft control facilities  as we believe that these facilities will continue to be used in our xm system 
a significant decrease in the estimated useful life of our satellites and spacecraft control facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period in which the estimate is revised and in subsequent periods 
dars license we determined that our dars license was an intangible asset having an indefinite useful life 
while the dars license has a renewable eight year term  we believe that the administrative fees necessary to renew the license are expected to be de minimis compared to the initial fee to obtain the license  and we have met all of the established milestones specified in the dars license agreement 
we also anticipate no difficulties in renewing the license as long as we continue to adhere to the various regulatory requirements established in the license grant 
although we face competition from a variety of sources  we do not believe that the risk of the technology becoming obsolete or that a decrease in demand for the dars service is significant 
further  we believe that our license is comparable with the licenses granted to other broadcasters  which are also classified as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we understand that there continues to be deliberations concerning the application of this standard regarding the effect of the costs to renew fcc licenses 
our application of this standard could change depending upon the results of these deliberations 
rebates we estimate and record reserves related to various promotional activities that include rebates to retailer and end users related to xm radios and accessories 
an incentive given to a retailer or end user related to the sale of an xm radio or accessory for which there is no direct revenue to xm or contingency attached to subscribe to our service is accounted for as an expense 
our reserves for retailer and end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our expenses for any period presented

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
we do not hold or issue any free standing derivatives 
we invest our cash in commercial paper  short term investment grade corporate and government obligations and money market funds 
we have existing obligations related to our long term debt agreements 
as of december   we did not have significant cash flow exposure to changing interest rates on our long term debt because the interest rates of the majority of those securities are fixed 
however  the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt is subject to market risk 
as of december   we had approximately million in fixed rate debt  which is approximately percent of total debt 
we run the risk that market rates will decline and the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
presented below is an analysis of our financial instruments as of december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables demonstrate the change in market value of the instruments calculated for an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates  plus or minus basis points bp  bp and bp 
with respect to our fixed rate debt  the sensitivity table below illustrates estimated market values  or the estimated price at which the debt would trade should interest rates fall or rise in the range indicated  assuming similar terms and similar assessment of risk by our lenders 
estimated market values are determined using quoted market prices or market rates on comparable instruments as of december  interest rate sensitivity at december  estimated market value fair value estimated market value in millions bp bp bp bp bp bp senior secured discount notes due senior secured notes due convertible senior notes due mortgages this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of our financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate changes on our financial instruments may differ significantly from the impact shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the senior secured convertible discount notes due  with an estimated fair value of approximately billion at december  are not included in the above analysis as the fair value of the notes is not significantly exposed to interest rate changes 
the holders of the notes may convert their notes into class a common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time prior to maturity 
due to the conversion feature of the instrument  coupled with the current price of our class a common stock  the fair value of the notes is linked largely to the price of class a common stock 
included in our fixed rate debt are million of capital leases and notes payable that are not included in the analysis as the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of their short maturity 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of variable rate debt 
a change of basis points in the interest rate applicable to the million of variable rate debt at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in our annual interest expense 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our results of operations
