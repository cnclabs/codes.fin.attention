wild oats markets  inc is one of the largest natural food supermarket chains in north america  with stores in states and british columbia  canada  as of february  our revenues are primarily derived from the retail sale of grocery products at our stores 
we operate in the retail grocery industry with two store formats the natural foods supermarket  under the wild oats natural marketplace name nationwide and capers community market name in canada  and the farmers market format  under the henry s farmers market name in southern california and phoenix  arizona  and the sun harvest name in texas 
both formats emphasize natural and organic products with a wide selection of products in a full service environment 
the formats share a core demographic customer profile 
we manage support services provided to the stores centrally from our boulder  colorado headquarters 
all of our stores  regardless of format  purchase from the same primary distributor based on centralized negotiations  merchandising and marketing strategies 
our riverside  california dc  opened in february  primarily supplies produce  private label groceries  and selected other items for the majority of our stores west of the mississippi river 
we continue to identify additional procurement opportunities to maximize efficiencies of the dc 
in  we opened eight new stores in existing markets and completed four major remodels 
we grew gross margins to by introducing new programs  addressing underperforming stores and reducing product costs 
we reduced direct store expenses by basis points through labor scheduling  operating initiatives and the leveraging of fixed expenses 
we continued to build our brand through private label growth and nontraditional alliances with peapod  a grocery delivery service in metropolitan chicago  illinois  and stop and shop supermarkets in the northeastern united states 
as of february   we had stores located in states and canada  as compared to stores in states and canada as of the end of fiscal a summary of store openings  acquisitions  closures and sales is as follows total store count fiscal year ending period ending feb  store count at beginning of period stores opened stores closed stores sold store count at end of period includes the closure of one store in phoenix  arizona that was converted to a new format and reopened in as has been our practice in the past  we will continue to evaluate the profitability  strategic positioning  impact of potential competition  and sales growth potential of all of our stores on an ongoing basis 
we may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  disposals  relocations or remodels in accordance with such evaluations 
in fiscal and through the date of this report  we have closed five stores  two pursuant to relocations to larger facilities  two that were smaller  older  under performing stores  and one when we exited the market area 
of the five stores  two leases have terminated 
outlook we expect to continue to grow top line sales through new stores  of which we intend to open approximately ten and continued comparable store sales growth of approximately four to five percent in we will continue to add new products to our shelves to provide more unique  specialty and gourmet items for our customers 
we plan to continue to grow our private label line of products and will add an additional new items under the wild oats and henry s product lines 
we continue to focus on strengthening our perishable products categories by adding more local and seasonal items to our mix in the produce and meat and seafood departments 
we introduced a number of new innovations to our prepared foods department in and will continue this development throughout we plan on leveraging the momentum we gained through in the merchandising or procurement of our products to get our gross margin to approximately percent for the fiscal year 
with increasing sales  we intend to further leverage our direct store expenses  particularly payroll  to keep costs controlled 
ebitda  as adjusted  in should fall in the million to million range  and will exclude non cash compensation charges as a result of sfas r  which requires the expensing of stock option value given to the employee 
earnings per share should be in the range of to for the full year 
both metrics include the impacts of the store closure estimates announced shortly after year end during  we intend to continue our real estate expansion strategy by opening stores in high demand areas where we do not already have a presence  as well as in locations that will allow us to relocate smaller  older stores 
for our wild oats natural marketplace stores  we also intend to expand into new markets with a focus on major metropolitan areas with higher density that index well for natural and organic foods shoppers 
we currently have leases or letters of intent signed for sites we plan to open this year and next  with an estimated stores opening in we will also complete up to six major remodels in  investing more than million per store to bring older stores up to date and expanding the size of our existing stores 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in both existing and new markets 
results of operations our net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of sales and in dollars percentages may not add due to rounding fiscal year sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses store contribution selling  general and administrative expenses loss on disposal of assets  net pre opening expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges income  net income loss from operations loss on early extinguishment of debt interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss year over year v 
comparisons of certain selected income statement data the following narrative compares those selected income statement data with material changes from year to year 
aggregate dollar amounts for fiscal reflect a week fiscal year  as compared to week fiscal sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended december   were billion  an increase of  compared with billion in fiscal excluding the rd week of sales of million during  sales were up over fiscal increases were attributable to comparable store sales growth of and the net increase of five stores in fiscal we ended the year with total square footage of million square feet  which is an increase of compared with million square feet at the end of comparable store sales for fiscal increased  as compared to in fiscal our comparable store sales started the year flat compared to results and have increased throughout due to new promotional plans and marketing and merchandising initiatives 
we have experienced continual growth of our private label brand throughout with private label sales growing over and faster than overall company sales growth 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales less costs of goods sold and store occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include store related depreciation  rent and utilities 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million as compared to million in fiscal  while gross profit margins increased to  compared to in fiscal  largely due to more strategic marketing and merchandising programs which have benefited our gross margin 
in addition  our stores opened in have generated higher gross margins than the stores we opened during direct store expenses 
direct store expenses include the following store payroll  taxes and benefits  store supplies and maintenance  in store community marketing  and other store specific costs 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased as a percent of sales to as compared to in fiscal direct store expenses decreased as a result of leveraging payroll and the related taxes against higher sales  along with benefit savings from our self insured workers compensation plan and the stabilization of healthcare costs 
additionally  payroll in our new stores as a percent of sales improved over performance 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the following corporate and regional administrative support services  and purchasing and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to of sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease as a percent of sales is attributable to greater operating efficiencies created by our third quarter home office restructuring and to leveraging against higher sales 
the increase of million in costs are due primarily to incremental accounting and legal fees incurred in the first quarter of related to our restatement  with regards to lease accounting and corporate and regional level bonuses 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  advertising  utilities  supplies  and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of eight new store openings in fiscal as compared to in fiscal restructuring and asset impairment charges income 
restructuring and asset impairment expense in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal and income of million in fiscal the following table summarizes the components of restructuring and asset impairment charges and income for fiscal years   and  respectively  in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal components of charge change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale includes accretion estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites identified to be closed or sold during the period severance for employees terminated during the period asset impairment charges write off of goodwill insurance proceeds received for impaired assets previously written off during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and asset impairment expense of million 
management decides to close or relocate stores in circumstances where the existing store is under performing and or a more desirable location in the same market becomes available 
warehouses and support facilities will be closed  consolidated  or relocated when opportunities arise to reduce overall costs of operations in those facilities 
details of the significant components are as follows in thousands changes in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites identified in previous years for closure  in restructuring expense 
during  we adjusted our estimates of remaining lease liabilities for locations closed in years before fiscal due to changes in marketability  subtenancy  or agreements reached with landlords that differed from the original estimated lease obligation 
in addition to the changes cited above  we incurred accretion expense of  during the year  for known changes in the net present value of future minimum lease payments 
estimate for sites identified for closure that were closed during the year million of restructuring expense 
during the year  we closed one store in oregon  one commissary kitchen in arizona  a regional office in california  and we relocated two stores  one in oregon and one in arizona 
related to these closures and relocations  we accrued for the period of time that best estimates our remaining lease liabilities and closure costs 
severance for employees notified of termination during the year  of restructuring expense 
during the year  employees were terminated in conjunction with the closing of one store  a commissary kitchen and regional office  and the relocation of two stores 
as of december   all  of involuntary termination benefits had been paid to terminated employees 
in addition   was also paid to terminated employees related to accruals from the prior year 
asset impairment charges 
million of restructuring expense 
during  we reviewed the undiscounted cash flows of all locations 
two locations had future cash flows that were less than the carrying value of their associated assets 
we impaired the fixed assets at these locations to their net realizable value 
also  during the year  we wrote off assets related to sites identified for future store locations that were subsequently determined insuitable 
other assets originally designated to be transferred from closed stores were deemed no longer useful and written off 
write off of goodwill 
 of restructuring expense 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company closed its remaining store in eugene  oregon and exited the market area 
the goodwill  net of accumulated amortization associated with this market area  was written off 
during the fiscal year ended  the company incurred  of charges for accelerated depreciation related to planned store closures 
these costs are included in the cost of goods sold and occupancy costs line of the consolidated statements of operations 
interest income 
interest income for the fiscal year ended december  was million compared to million in fiscal the increase is directly attributable to a full year of cash investments from the proceeds from our debenture issuance in fiscal as compared to a partial year in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  increased to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase over is due to a full year of interest from the debenture offering completed in june as compared to a partial year in fiscal income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the effective rate is due to a number of factors  including a much smaller change in the tax valuation allowance during  an adjustment of the deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from the restatement  and the expiration of certain tax attributes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of  compared to a net deferred tax asset of  for the fiscal year ending january  the net deferred tax asset is related to the temporary differences on the canadian fixed assets 
the company anticipates continuing to report taxable income in canada and  therefore  no valuation allowance was established against this asset 
the amount has decreased during the current year for two reasons 
first  a true up related to the fiscal income tax return reduced the asset and second  the asset was further reduced due to an excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation in canada for the current fiscal year 
net income loss 
in fiscal  we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with net loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  loss on early extinguishment of debt  loss gain on asset disposals  net  restructuring and asset impairment charges income  net  as adjusted ebitda  as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  was million  or of sales for the fiscal year ended december   an increase as compared to million  or of sales in the fiscal year ended we believe that the reconciliation of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  provides meaningful non gaap financial measures to help management and investors understand and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis  independently of regularly reported non cash charges and infrequent or unusual events as determined by management 
readers are cautioned not to view ebitda or ebitda  as adjusted  as an alternative to gaap results or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies  and should refer to the reconciliation of gaap net income loss results to ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  for the years ended and  respectively 
for an explanation of ebitda  and ebitda  as adjusted  see non gaap financial information 
year over year v 
the following narrative compares those selected income statement data with material changes from year to year 
aggregate dollar amounts for fiscal reflect a week fiscal year  as compared to week fiscal sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended january   were billion  an increase of  compared with million in fiscal excluding the rd week of sales of million during  sales were up over fiscal increases were attributable to the addition of new stores in fiscal  despite the closure of seven stores during the fiscal year  as we ended the year with total square footage of million square feet  which is an increase of compared with million square feet at the end of comparable store sales for fiscal increased  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in comparable store sales over results from the greater benefit of the southern california conventional grocery strike in the fourth quarter of as compared to the smaller impact in the first quarter of in the second half of  we increased our promotional activity to drive customer count to retain some of the customers that came to us during the strike 
the positive impact to sales year over year was offset by the decrease in gross profit percentage 
total sales increased in despite supply chain disruptions experienced in the first quarter of with our former primary distributor  and issues of quality and consistency throughout in produce distributions from our new california warehouse 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales less costs of goods sold and store occupancy costs 
occupancy costs include store related depreciation  rent and utilities 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended january  increased to million as compared to million in fiscal  while gross profit margins declined to  compared to in fiscal  largely due to promotional activity  such as our thanksgiving promotion  in selected regions of the country in the second half of to attract new customers and retain customers gained during the southern california conventional grocery strike and changes to our distribution processes 
the impact of the combined promotional activity and distribution changes is estimated at basis points of the reduction from prior year 
margins  or gross profit percentage  declined basis points over last year due to the effect of newer stores defined as stores open less than months being a larger percent of our total store base 
traditionally  our newer stores carry lower margins due to higher shrink and heavy promotional activity 
the impact of accelerated depreciation was approximately  more during than  and amounted to a million of a decrease to gross profit during direct store expenses 
direct store expenses include the following store payroll  taxes and benefits  store supplies and maintenance  in store community marketing  and other store specific contract costs 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased as a percent of sales to as compared to in fiscal direct store expenses increased as a result of the addition of five new stores net of closed stores and an overall increase in sales and same store customer traffic 
our new stores typically have a higher payroll as a percentage of sales for up to the first months of operation 
in addition to the higher new store payroll percentages  we incurred benefit cost increases in the self insured areas of health and workers compensation of over million  along with a million charge for the expected cost of remediating our k plan  for which we have filed a voluntary compliance plan with the internal revenue service 
we have also changed some of our marketing efforts to store level versus national level  and the related costs have been reflected as direct store expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the following corporate and regional administrative support services  and purchasing and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended january   decreased to as a percent of sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decreases of million and are attributable to consolidation of work functions at our headquarters  continued control and monitoring of administrative costs and a small shift of marketing emphasis from the national to the store level 
these decreases were offset by increased professional fees related to the sarbanes oxley act of and audit costs related to our audit of past administrative practices in the company s k plan 
loss on disposal of assets 
during  as a result of the significant store closings  remodels and resets  we undertook a review of all fixtures and equipment in our stores  offices  and support facilities  including a physical inventory in conjunction with an asset tagging exercise 
we completed the review and recorded in fiscal a million loss on disposal of fixtures and equipment 
losses on disposal amounts for and years prior to relate to assets disposed of in the normal course of business and were not material 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  advertising  utilities  supplies  and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended january   increased as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of new store openings in fiscal as compared to eight in fiscal our average pre opening expense per store increased as we focused efforts on increasing the knowledge base of the consumer  training our employees  and changes in our leasing terms 
the timing of the store openings in also has contributed to the amounts expensed during  as certain pre opening expense for the two stores opened at the end of january were incurred and expensed in restructuring and asset impairment charges income 
restructuring and asset impairment expense in fiscal was million  as compared to income of million in fiscal the table on page summarizes the components of restructuring and asset impairment charges and income for fiscal years   and  respectively 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges for details of the significant components of the expense income 
interest income 
interest income for the fiscal year ended january  was million compared to  in fiscal the increase is directly attributable to cash and short term investment increases relating to proceeds from our debenture issuance 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended january  increased to million or as compared to fiscal the increase over is due to average borrowings increasing from the debenture offering completed in june income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended january  was as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the effective rate is due to the company s conclusion that a valuation allowance was needed in against its net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was recorded as a result of the company s analysis of the facts and circumstances  including an evaluation of its pre tax income and losses for the historical periods  which led the company to conclude that it could no longer forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
net income loss 
in fiscal  we generated a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per share in fiscal aside from the tax valuation allowance described above  the loss resulted from disruptions caused by our prior distributor arrangement  which was terminated at the end of the first quarter  additional disruptions throughout the year resulting from the transition of stores produce distribution to our new distribution facility  lower projected performance by certain new stores opened in  and increased merchandising and marketing expenditures to combat increased competition in selected regions and drive customer traffic 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we transitioned our perishables distribution in the western region of the country to our new distribution center  completed the consolidation of a third warehouse facility in the first half of fiscal in southern california  and transitioned to a new primary distributor 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements to disclose 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion no 
the new standard establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  including stock option and restricted stock grants 
under sfas no 
r  we will be required to select a valuation technique  or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard 
allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the black scholes model 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal year using the modified prospective application and the black scholes valuation model 
we currently anticipate expensing million during as a result of the adoption of fas no 
r and changes we have made to our stock compensation incentives 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will require us to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of sfas no 
r under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock option s remaining vesting period 
in addition  sfas no 
r will require us to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow  which will impact our future reported cash flows from operating activities 
we intend to keep our broad based stock option program in place  however  in response to sfas no 
r  we have amended our employee stock purchase program espp to decrease the discount on the price of shares to and to apply the discount to the price on the date in which the buy period closes each quarter 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
requires restatement of prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp no 
fas 
fsp no 
fas requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
fsp fas no 
is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the transition provisions of fsp no 
fas permit early adoption and retrospective application of the guidance 
we currently and have historically recognized these costs as rental expense and therefore  the adoption of fsp no 
fas will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations and bank indebtedness 
primary uses of cash have been the financing of new store development through leases  capital expenditures  and remodels 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal the generation of cash from operations consisted of the net income of million with adjustments for depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  non cash restructuring charges and other items that reconcile net income to cash  as well as increases in inventories offset by decreases to receivables and other assets  and increases to accounts payable  and accrued liabilities and other liabilities 
we expect the closure and or relocation of three stores in to ultimately result in improved store contributions and cash flows for the company 
the short term cash flow effects of these closures and or relocations usually involve some severance costs 
costs for removal of furniture  fixtures  and inventory for these closures are expected to be minimal  however  the net present value of the lease payments and the impairment of related fixed assets on these stores is expected to be material 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  which consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment for our new stores and remodeled locations  and purchases of short term investments 
these expenditures were offset slightly by cash proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment 
we spent approximately million during for new store construction  development  remodels and other capital expenditures 
our average capital expenditures to open a leased store  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures  have ranged from approximately million to million historically  excluding inventory costs and initial operating losses 
we anticipate that the average capital expenditures to open a natural foods supermarket format store will be million to million in the future  on a turnkey lease basis 
under turnkey leases  the landlord constructs the building to our specifications  up to a cost cap per foot  and installs equipment we purchase 
average capital expenditures for non turnkey leases are expected between million and million 
our average capital expenditures to open a farmers market format store are estimated at million to million in the future 
delays in opening new stores may result in increased capital expenditures and increased pre opening costs for the site  as well as lower than planned sales for the company 
the cost of initial inventory for a new store is approximately  to  depending on the store format  however  we obtain vendor financing for most of this cost 
the amounts and timing of such pre opening costs will depend upon the availability of new store sites and other factors  including the location of the store and whether it is in a new or existing market for us  the size of the store  and the required build out at the site 
costs to acquire future stores  if any  are impossible to predict and could vary materially from the cost to open new stores 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal attributable primarily to proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
ebitda 
ebitda was million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in ebitda as compared to is primarily attributable to the increase in pre tax income of million 
for an explanation and reconciliation of ebitda  see non gaap financial information 
debt to ebitda  as adjusted  a measure of the company s ability service it s debt  has improved over three times from contingent convertible senior debentures 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due may  in a private placement 
the debentures bear regular interest at the annual rate of  payable semiannually on may and november of each year until may   after which date  no regular interest will be due 
commencing may  and ending november   and for any six month period thereafter  contingent interest will be due and payable in the amount of of the average trading price of the debentures during a specified period  if the average trading price of the debentures equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
during the second quarter of  we made an irrevocable election to pay the principal amount of debentures in cash upon conversion  however  the company retains the ability to satisfy the remainder of any conversion payment  in cash or any combination of cash and common stock 
according to their terms  the debentures are callable and convertible into our common stock prior to maturity at the option of the holders under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter commencing after june  and before march   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the conversion price of per share for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the proceeding calendar quarter  at any time on or after april  if the last reported sale price of our common stock on any date on or after march  is greater than or equal to of the conversion price  subject to certain limitations  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per debenture for each day of that period was less than of the product of the conversion rate and the last reported sale price of our common stock  if we call the debentures for redemption  upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  or if we obtain credit ratings for the debentures  at any time when the credit ratings assigned to the debentures are below specified levels 
while a credit rating has been issued for the debentures  the rating was not requested by us  but initiated by the ratings agency 
therefore  a change in the current rating will not trigger a call provision 
the debentures were initially convertible into shares of our common stock per  principal amount  which is equivalent to per share  for total initial underlying shares of  the conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
upon conversion  the company has made an irrevocable election to pay the principal amount of the debentures in cash and may satisfy the remainder of any conversion payment in common stock  cash or any combination of cash and common stock 
pursuant to the underwriting agreement and within days of issuance  we filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the debentures and the common stock issuable upon conversion thereof 
the registration statement was declared effective august  on or after may   we may redeem for cash some or all of the debentures at any time and from time to time  for a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid contingent interest  if any 
holders have the right to require us to repurchase any or all debentures for cash  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued and unpaid interest on may   may   and may   and upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the debenture indenture 
in the case of a fundamental change in which all of the consideration for the common stock in the transaction or transactions constituting the fundamental change consists of cash  we also will pay to the holders a make whole premium as defined in the debenture indenture  the amount of which could be significant but would not be determinable unless and until there were to be a public announcement of such a fundamental change 
any make whole premium would be payable to all holders regardless of whether the holder elects to require us to repurchase the debentures or elects to surrender the debentures for conversion 
the debentures are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations  and rank equal in priority with all of our existing and future unsecured and un subordinated indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all of its subordinated indebtedness 
the debentures will effectively rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness and any of its indebtedness that is guaranteed by its subsidiaries 
payment of principal and interest on the debentures will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries 
there are no financial covenants within the debenture agreement  however  we paid penalty interest of for the first days of and thereafter until the debentures were publicly registered on august  as of december   all  in accrued additional interest to debenture holders due to not having an effective registration statement within the specified timeframe had been paid 
credit facility 
on march   we entered into a five year revolving secured credit facility with bank of america  na the b of a facility 
concurrent with the execution of the b of a facility  we terminated our existing million credit facility with wells fargo bank na as administrative agent 
the b of a facility allows borrowings and letters of credit up to a maximum of million  with an option to increase borrowings up to million  subject to a borrowing base determined by the value of certain inventory  credit card receivables  invested cash and  at our discretion  mortgaged leaseholds 
the b of a facility is secured by certain of our assets including  but not limited to  cash  inventory and fixed assets 
borrowings under the b of a facility bear interest  at our election  at the prime rate or at the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin ranging from to  depending on the excess borrowing availability over amounts borrowed 
interest rates are determined quarterly 
we are charged a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility 
there are no financial covenants  other than the obligation to maintain a certain percentage of minimum excess availability as defined in the agreement at all times 
the b of a facility requires compliance on a monthly basis with certain non financial covenants  including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and making investments  the use and disposition of collateral  changes of control  as well as cash management provisions 
in conjunction with the debt refinancing  we wrote off approximately  of the remaining unamortized debt issuance cost from the wells facility and capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately  as of december   to be amortized over the life of the agreement using the effective interest method 
as of december   the company had letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which reduces our availability to approximately million 
our prior credit facility was entered into in february of and terminated march   with wells fargo bank na acting as lead bank and administrative agent the wells facility 
the wells facility had a million limit and a three year term with a one year renewal option 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  unconsolidated subsidiaries  commitments or guarantees  except as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity at december  of million represented of total assets 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million as compared to million in the increase in working capital was primarily attritributed to an increase in cash  short term investments and inventories over prior year of million  million  and million  respectively  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  and other of  we believe that cash generated from operations  and available under our credit facility  in addition to our existing short term investments  will be sufficient to satisfy our budgeted cash requirements through fiscal in the past  we have primarily used cash flows generated from operations  improvements in working capital and equity proceeds to fund store growth 
as our store development plan accelerates  we expect that a greater proportion of our capital will be funded through borrowings on the b of a facility than we have utilized in the past 
we will continually evaluate other sources of capital and will seek those considered appropriate for future acquisition or accelerated store growth opportunities 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  to provide adequate working capital  and to expand as planned for the foreseeable future the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  when required 
if additional funds were to be raised through the sale of equity securities or additional convertible debt instruments  additional dilution to existing shareholders would likely result 
the following is a summary of our lease and debt obligations  construction commitments and outstanding letters of credit as of december  aggregate contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands expected future cash payments total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt  capital lease and financing lease obligations operating leases construction commitments amount of commitment expiration per period total thereafter commercial commitments letters of credit  long term debt 
during june of  we completed the issuance of million in convertible debt  at a fixed interest rate of  payable semi annually  and we have included this interest in the table above 
in addition to the convertible debentures  our credit facility  carries a commitment fee for the unused portion of the facility and a fee for outstanding letters of credit

capital lease and financing lease obligations 
the number and dollar amount of capital leases and financing leases are limited by our bank agreements and as a business practice 
certain store locations meet the criteria of capital leases and financing leases  while other capital leases are for computer software 
operating leases

as we prepare to open new stores  capital assets are ordered yet not delivered as of the year end 
other obligations 
we do not have minimum purchase requirements or other contractual obligations in our business 
letters of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit for million from the b of a facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates  including those related to goodwill valuation  asset impairment charges  restructuring charges and store closing costs  inventory valuation and reserves  self insurance reserves  and tax valuation allowances we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
there have been no changes in in the application of these policies goodwill 
goodwill consists of the excess cost of acquired companies over the sum of the fair market value of their underlying tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually at a reporting unit level  or more frequently if certain indicators of impairment exist 
we have one reporting unit at the enterprise level to which goodwill is allocated 
we estimate fair value utilizing a combination of three different methods  consisting of market capitalization  discounted future cash flows  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar multiples  and compare it to the carrying value of the enterprise for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
the annual review for impairment relies heavily on our ability to accurately project future cash flows  which in itself  requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial assumptions and estimates 
these projections can be affected by many items that are interdependent on one another and are outside of our control and ability to predict except at the time of evaluation  such as changes in the economy  trends affecting the natural and organic food industry  and changing competitive pressures 
application of alternative assumptions such as evaluating for impairment at a level of the organization other than enterprise could produce significantly different results 
two of the most significant assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets are the ebitdar multiples and the growth rate on our free cash flow projections 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment measurement  we determined that a reduction in our estimated ebitdar multiple would have decreased the valuation by million 
a reduction in our estimated free cash flow projection percentage would have resulted in a decrease of million 
taking into consideration these two calculated decreases  our lowest valuation still exceeds book value  and therefore  no impairment is indicated 
impairment of long lived assets 
we monitor the carrying value of our long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  for potential impairment whenever changes in circumstance indicate a potential for impairment may exist 
the triggering events for evaluations of finite lived intangible assets include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  acquisition and construction costs in excess of budget  or current store operating losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses 
if impairment is identified  based on undiscounted future cash flows  management compares the asset s future cash flows  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate  to its current carrying value and records a provision for impairment as appropriate 
with respect to equipment and leasehold improvements associated with closed stores  the value of these assets is adjusted to reflect recoverable values estimated based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets  with consideration for current economic conditions 
our review for impairment relies heavily on our ability to accurately project future cash flows related to our stores and support facilities 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions about sales growth and cost trends that could be significantly impacted by changes in the local and national economy  trends in the natural and organic food industry  local competitive pressures  as well as the effectiveness of various operational initiatives underway in our stores 
a increase in our sales growth assumption utilized in the cash flow projection would have resulted in no stores identified for impairment and no related asset impairment charges 
a decrease in our sales growth assumption would have resulted in the impairment of an additional two stores held for use and approximately million of additional asset impairment charges 
restructuring and store closure costs 
we reserve for the present value of lease related costs associated with store and support facility closures  relocations  and sales when the store or facility is closed 
the calculation of the lease related liabilities involves applying a discount rate to the estimation of our remaining lease obligations  taxes and common area maintenance  net of future estimated subtenant income 
the lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which have had remaining terms ranging from one month to years 
store closing liabilities are reviewed each reporting period to ensure that the amounts recorded reasonably reflect our future obligations associated with closed stores and facilities based on the most current information available 
adjustments to existing lease related liabilities are primarily a result of changes in the expected timing or amount of subtenant income  and are made in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances  as well as their related impacts  become known and estimatable 
lease related closure costs and associated severance costs are made in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities 
severance costs incurred in connection with store closings are recorded when the employees have been identified and notified of the termination benefits to be made to the employees 
in evaluating the reserves for lease related liabilities  management considers a number of variables that would affect the marketability of the space such as recent demand for similar space in the market area  the number of potential subtenants expressing interest  specific characteristics of the property  any limitations in the use of the space imposed by the landlord  as well as the creditworthiness of actual subtenants 
the above factors are continuously reevaluated and have a significant impact on management s assumptions used in estimating the timing and amount of any subtenant income  and thus the amount of required reserves 
in calculating the lease related liabilities  we apply a discount rate to the estimation of our remaining lease obligations 
by decreasing the discount rate by  we determined that our estimate for lease related restructuring expense for sites identified for closure in fiscal would have increased by approximately  an increase of in the discount rate would have decreased our estimate for lease related restructuring expense for sites identified for closure in fiscal by approximately inventory 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis using the retail method of accounting to determine cost of sales and inventory for approximately of inventories and using the item cost method for highly perishable products representing approximately of inventories in our stores 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various categories of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
physical inventory counts are taken at each location at least quarterly to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated as of the end of each reporting period 
we maintain allowances for excess or unsaleable inventory as a percentage of its gross inventory balance based on historical experience and assumptions about market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if we expand our forward buying of inventory  which will increase our inventory levels  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
relative to the above  a hypothetical increase of to our cost to retail ratio would result in a decrease of approximately  to our inventory valuation 
conversely  a hypothetical decrease of would result in an increase of approximately  to our inventory balance as of the end of fiscal with regards to our allowance for inventory  an increase or decrease of as a percentage of gross inventory would cause our allowance to fluctuate by about  self insurance 
we use a combination of stop loss insurance and are self insured for losses relating to worker s compensation claims  general liability and employee medical and dental benefits 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit exposure to any significant claim or levels of claims that would be catastrophic to our company 
self insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate uninsured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry which are based on our industry s experience as well as our historical claims experience 
while we believe that the assumptions and methodology used are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if actual loss development and payment patterns vary significantly from the assumptions and historical trends utilized 
tax valuation allowances 
we utilize the concepts and guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes in assessing the ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
the company establishes valuation allowances based on historical taxable income  projected future income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
based on our analysis  in we retained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets generated from our us operations because we believe we could not meet the more likely than not realizability guidance under sfas no 
when we are able to show a profitable trend generally cumulative book income over the previous quarters  we will re evaluate the need for a valuation allowance using all factors available to us at that time

non gaap financial information the following is a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  to net income in thousands fiscal year net income loss interest expense  net of interest income income tax expense depreciation and amortization ebitda loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on asset disposals  net restructuring and asset impairment charges income  net ebitda  as adjusted ebitda  as a percentage of sales ebitda  as adjusted  as a percentage of sales ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  are measures used by management to measure operating performance 
ebitda is defined as net income before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
ebitda  as adjusted  excludes certain non cash charges and other items that management does not utilize in assessing operating performance or for purposes of corporate and regional level bonuses 
the items included in the reconciliation from ebitda to ebitda  as adjusted  are either a non cash items eg asset impairments  gain loss on early extinguishment of debt or b items that management does not consider to be relevant to assessing operating performance eg  gain loss on sale of assets  net 
regarding the non cash items  management believes that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without such items 
in the case of the items that management does not consider relevant to assessing operating performance  management believes that investors can better assess ongoing operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact has no continuing relevance to our ongoing business 
the above table reconciles net income to ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted 
management believes that ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  are useful to investors because securities analysts  lenders and other interested parties frequently utilize them to evaluate our peer companies and us 
neither ebitda nor ebitda  as adjusted  are recognized terms under gaap and do not purport to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or any other gaap measure 
not all companies utilize identical calculations  therefore  the presentation of ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  may not be comparable to other identically titled measures of other companies 
in addition  ebitda and ebitda  as adjusted  are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management s discretionary use since they do not consider certain cash requirements  such as interest payments  tax payments and capital expenditures 
beginning in the first quarter of  due to the implementation of sfas r  we will also exclude stock based compensation expense from our ebitda  as adjusted  calculation 
comparable stores sales 
we deem sales of a new or acquired stores comparable commencing in the thirteenth full month of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in fossil fuel commodity prices  interest rates and the value of foreign currency 
fossil fuel commodity prices directly impact the costs the company pays for utilities and distribution  and are subject to flucuation due to availability and other natural causes 
the company attempts to balance retail price increases against lost profits without losing customer loyalty 
we employ various financial instruments to manage certain exposures when practical 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we own and operate three natural foods supermarkets and a commissary kitchen in british columbia  canada 
the commissary supports the three canadian stores and does not independently generate sales revenue 
sales made from the canadian stores are made in exchange for canadian dollars 
to the extent that those revenues are repatriated to the united states  the amounts repatriated are subject to the exchange rate fluctuations between the two currencies 
we do not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk 
should we begin drawing on the b of a facility for additional capital  our exposure to interest rate changes would be primarily related to our variable rate debt issued under the b of a facility 
the total commitment available is million under a revolving line of credit  with a five year term expiring march  because the interest rate on the facility is variable  based upon the prime rate or libor  our interest expense and net income would be affected by interest rate fluctuations 
in september  as required by our former credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure on variable rate debt positions 
variable rates were predominantly linked to libor as determined by one month intervals 
the interest rate provided by the swap fixed one month libor at 
at december   the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement was million  and expired in august there was no obligation to renew the swap under the refinanced facility 
the notional amount is the amount used for the calculation of interest payments that are exchanged over the life of the swap transaction on the amortized principal balance 
in fiscal through its expiration in august of  the loss of  was reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income for this cash flow hedge
