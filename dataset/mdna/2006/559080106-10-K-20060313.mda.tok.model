item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in march  the board of directors of our general partner approved a two for one split of our limited partner units 
according to the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  we have retroactively changed the number of our limited partner units and the net income and distribution per limited partner unit amounts to give effect to this two for one split for all periods presented in this report 
we define ebitda  which is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  in the following schedules as net income plus provision for income taxes  debt prepayment premiums  write off of unamortized debt placement fees  debt placement fee amortization  interest expense net of interest income and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash flow from operations or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda excludes some items that affect net income and these items may vary among other companies  the ebitda data presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
our management uses ebitda as a performance measure to assess the viability of projects and to determine overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income  the nearest comparable gaap measure  is included in the following schedules 
in addition to ebitda  the non gaap measure of operating margin in the aggregate and by segment is presented in the following table 
we compute the components of operating margin by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  is included in the following tables see note segment disclosures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating margin to segment operating profit 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin is an important measure of the economic performance of our core operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our management in deciding how to allocate capital resources between segments 
operating profit  alternatively  includes expense items  such as depreciation and amortization and g a expenses  which management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation

prior to our acquisition of magellan pipeline on april   magellan pipeline was also subject to income taxes 
because we are a partnership  the petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system were no longer subject to income taxes after our initial public offering  and magellan pipeline was no longer subject to income taxes following our acquisition of it 
b at the time of our initial public offering  the affiliate note payable associated with the petroleum products terminals operations was contributed to us as a capital contribution by a former affiliate 
c cash distributions declared represent distributions declared associated with each respective calendar year 
distributions were declared and paid within days following the close of each quarter 
cash distributions declared for include a pro rated distribution for the first quarter  which included the period from february  through march  cash distributions paid represent cash payments for distributions for each of the periods presented

prior to all property  plant and equipment was recorded at the segment level 
the associated depreciation expense was allocated to our various business segments  which in turn  recognized these allocated costs as operating expense 
consequently  segment operating margins were reduced by these costs

f the increase in our marine terminal throughput from to was primarily due to a full year of activity at our east houston facility  which was acquired in october item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a publicly traded limited partnership formed to own  operate and acquire a diversified portfolio of complementary energy assets 
we are principally engaged in the transportation  storage and distribution of refined petroleum products 
our three operating segments include petroleum products pipeline system  which is primarily comprised of our  mile petroleum products pipeline system  including terminals  petroleum products terminals  which principally includes our seven marine terminal facilities and inland terminals  and ammonia pipeline system  representing our  mile ammonia pipeline and six associated terminals 
the following discussion provides an analysis of the results for each of our operating segments  an overview of our liquidity and capital resources and other items related to our company 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  significant events two for one split 
during march  the board of directors of our general partner approved a two for one split of our limited partner units 
on april   holders of record at the close of business on april  received one additional limited partner unit for each limited partner unit owned on that date 
in this report  we have retroactively changed the number of our units and our per unit distribution amounts to give effect to this unit split for all periods presented 
recent developments on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the period of october through december  including this declaration  we paid distributions equal to per unit related to compared to per unit related to  an increase in excess of 
in addition  the per unit distribution represented a increase compared to our per unit distribution at the time of our initial public offering in february the per unit distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record on january  during february  magellan midstream holdings  lp mgg  the owner of our general partner interest  sold of its mgg common units in an initial public offering 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from mgg s initial public offering and do not expect our ownership structure or operations to be materially impacted by this transaction 
in connection with the closing of this offering  we amended our partnership agreement to remove the requirement for our general partner to maintain its interest in any future offering of our limited partner units 
in addition  we amended our partnership agreement to restore the incentive distribution rights to the same level as before an amendment made in connection with our october pipeline system acquisition  which reduced the incentive distributions paid to our general partner by million for  million for and million for in return  mgg made a capital contribution to us on february  equal to the present value of the remaining reductions in incentive distributions  or million 
overview our petroleum products pipeline system and petroleum products terminals generate substantially all of our cash flows 
the revenues generated from these petroleum products businesses are significantly influenced by demand for refined petroleum products  which has been growing in the markets we serve 
operating expenses are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on our pipeline and stored in our terminals 
expenses resulting from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
for further discussion of indemnified environmental matters  see business environmental under item of this annual report on form k 
a prolonged period of high refined product prices could lead to a reduction in demand and result in lower shipments on our pipeline system and reduced demand for our terminal services 
in addition  fluctuations in the prices of refined petroleum products impact the amount of cash our petroleum products pipeline system generates from its third party supply agreement and its petroleum products blending and fractionation operations 
also  increased maintenance regulations  higher power costs and higher interest rates could decrease the amount of cash we generate 
see item a risk factors for other risk factors which could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
petroleum products pipeline system 
our petroleum products pipeline system is comprised of a common carrier pipeline that provides transportation  storage and distribution services for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gases in states from texas through the midwest to colorado  north dakota  minnesota  wisconsin and illinois 
through direct refinery connections and interconnections with other interstate pipelines  our petroleum products pipeline system can access more than of the refinery capacity in the continental united states 
the pipeline generates approximately of its revenues  excluding the sale of petroleum products  through transportation tariffs for volumes of petroleum products it ships 
these tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates  where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts 
all interstate transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the pipeline also earns revenues from non tariff based activities  including leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers on a long term basis and by providing data services and product services such as ethanol unloading and loading  additive injection  custom blending and laboratory testing 
in general  we do not take title to the products that we transport 
however  we do take title to products related to our petroleum products blending and fractionation operations and third party supply agreement  both of which are included in our petroleum products pipeline system segment 
we assumed the third party supply agreement in october as part of a pipeline system acquisition  and this agreement requires us to buy and sell significant quantities of petroleum products  to which we routinely take title 
although our petroleum products blending and fractionation operations and third party supply agreement generate significant revenues  we believe the gross margin from these activities  which takes into account the related product purchases  better represents its importance to our results of operations 
petroleum products terminals 
our petroleum products terminals segment is comprised of marine and inland terminals  which store and distribute gasoline and other petroleum products throughout states 
our marine terminals are large storage and distribution terminals that are strategically located near major refining hubs along the us gulf and east coasts and principally serve refiners and large end users of petroleum products 
we earn revenues at our marine facilities primarily from storage fees we charge and from throughput fees 
our inland terminals are part of a distribution network located principally throughout the southeastern united states 
these inland terminals are connected to large  third party interstate pipelines and are utilized by retail suppliers  wholesalers and marketers to transfer gasoline and other petroleum products from these pipelines to trucks  railcars or barges for delivery to their final destination 
we earn revenues at our inland terminals primarily from fees we charge based on the volumes of refined petroleum products distributed from these locations and from ancillary services such as additive injections 
ammonia pipeline system 
our ammonia pipeline system transports and distributes ammonia from production facilities in texas and oklahoma to various distribution points in the midwest for use as an agricultural fertilizer 
we generate revenues principally from volume based fees for the transportation of ammonia on our pipeline system 
effective february  we entered into an agreement with a third party pipeline company to operate our ammonia pipeline system 
operating costs and expenses charged to us are principally fixed costs related to maintenance and field personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported on the pipeline 
acquisition history we have significantly increased our operations over the past three years  including the following acquisitions in november and december  the acquisition of two terminals on our petroleum products pipeline system  located in wichita  kansas and aledo  texas  in september  the acquisition of a marine terminal near wilmington  delaware  in october  the acquisition of a  mile petroleum products pipeline system  in march  the acquisition of a ownership interest in a crude oil pipeline company  in january  the acquisition of six inland terminals and the remaining ownership interest in eight terminals  and in july  the acquisition of a petroleum products blending operation 
results of operations we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management 
operating margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate the economic performance of our core operations 
this measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by management in deciding how to allocate capital resources between segments 
operating margin is not a generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure  but the components of operating margin are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of operating margin to operating profit  which is its nearest comparable gaap financial measure  is included in the tables below 
operating profit includes expense items  such as depreciation and amortization and general and administrative g a expenses  which management does not consider when evaluating the core profitability of an operation

for the year ended december   represents the average storage capacity utilized for the three months we owned our east houston  texas facility million barrels and the average storage capacity utilized for the full year at our other marine terminals million barrels 
b the increase in our marine terminal throughput from to was primarily due to a full year of activity at our east houston facility  which was acquired in october transportation and terminals revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was a result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily attributable to revenues from our october pipeline system acquisition 
in addition  our existing pipeline system experienced higher revenues because of increased diesel fuel shipments 
further  we earned more ancillary revenues related to services such as additives  ethanol blending  terminal services and management fee income  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or 
the period benefited from our east houston marine terminal  which was acquired as part of our pipeline system acquisition in october  and our wilmington marine facility  which we acquired in september revenues at our other marine terminals increased as well due to higher storage capacities  utilization and rates 
increased throughput and higher additive injection fees at our inland terminals further benefited the period  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or 
higher tariffs associated with new transportation agreements  which became effective july   more than offset reduced volumes 
the lower volumes primarily reflect customers continued maintenance of tight inventory levels due to increased production costs as a result of higher natural gas prices in operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements combined were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
by business segment  this increase was principally the result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily attributable to operating costs associated with the pipeline system we acquired in october increased expenses related to higher environmental accruals associated with historical incidents  power costs and system integrity spending for tank maintenance and pipeline testing also impacted the period  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or 
expenses increased due to operating costs associated with the acquisitions of our east houston and wilmington marine facilities 
in addition  expenses were higher because of environmental accruals associated with historical incidents  asset retirements and property taxes  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily attributable to increased system integrity costs and higher property taxes due to an adjustment that positively impacted the period 
revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in gross margin from these transactions of million 
the gross margin resulting from product sales and purchases for the period increased million compared to gross margin for the period of million  resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the gross margin increase in primarily resulted from the impact of very high and increasing gasoline prices on our petroleum products blending and fractionation operations and the third party supply agreement we assumed as part of the pipeline assets we acquired in october we expect the annual amount of product sales and purchases to remain at a higher level than historically reported prior to october as a result of this agreement 
however  we expect the gross margin related to this agreement to be substantially lower on an annual basis once refined product prices stabilize 
equity earnings were million during the year ended december  and million for the period 
the increase is due primarily to increased shipments on our owned crude oil pipeline company that we acquired in march and a full year ownership in compared to months in operating margin increased million  or  primarily due to incremental operating results associated with recent acquisitions  higher gross margin from product sales and improved utilization of our other assets 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  primarily related to our october pipeline system acquisition and terminal acquisitions and capital improvements over the past year 
affiliate g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to additional g a personnel and costs resulting from our october pipeline system acquisition 
higher equity based incentive compensation expense during the period was partially offset by transition costs associated with our separation from the former owner of our general partner during the period 
excluding non cash incentive compensation expense  our actual cash outlay for g a costs  as determined by our agreement with the owner of our general partner  was million for the year ended and million for based on this agreement  the amount of g a costs we pay increases by annually and by incremental g a expenses related to completed acquisitions 
based on our current asset portfolio  we expect to pay g a costs  net of reimbursements  of million during interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
our average debt outstanding  excluding fair value adjustments for interest rate hedges  increased to million during from million during primarily due to the financing associated with our october pipeline system acquisition 
further  the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings  after giving effect to the impact of associated fair value hedges  increased to for the period from for the period primarily due to rising interest rates 
while we had no refinancing costs in  net refinancing costs were million during these costs included a million debt prepayment premium related to the early extinguishment of a portion of our previously outstanding magellan pipeline notes in may and a million write off for unamortized debt placement fees associated with the retired debt 
partially offsetting these charges was a million gain on an interest rate hedge related to the refinancing

transportation and terminals revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was a result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily attributable to additional revenues from our october pipeline system acquisition and significantly higher diesel and aviation fuel volumes on our existing pipeline system during resulting from increased market demand due to the improving us economy 
further  management fee income associated with our operation of the longhorn pipeline beginning in and higher additive and tank lease revenues also contributed to the revenue increase  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily due to additional revenues from our acquisition of ownership interests in inland terminals during january and our marine terminal in east houston  texas  which was acquired as part of the pipeline system acquisition in october further  higher utilization and rates at our marine terminals and increased throughput at our other inland terminals benefited the period  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily due to significantly increased transportation volumes during volumes increased primarily due to the implementation of a new incentive tariff program during late and higher farm commodity prices which increased demand for ammonia fertilizer 
operating expenses  environmental expenses and environmental reimbursements combined were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
by business segment  this increase was principally the result of an increase in petroleum products pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily attributable to operating costs associated with the pipeline system acquired in october  unfavorable product loss allowances  asset retirements  higher allocated depreciation that is charged as an operating expense since third quarter  increased asset integrity costs and higher insurance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower employee costs due to a benefits accrual recorded during associated with the june change in control of our general partner  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  primarily due to operating costs associated with acquisition of the ownership interests in inland terminals and the east houston marine terminal 
these increases were partially offset by reduced asset retirements and lower employee costs due to a benefits accrual recorded during associated with the change in control of our general partner  an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily attributable to higher system integrity costs and environmental accruals  partially offset by lower property taxes due to a favorable adjustment during the period  and an increase in intersegment eliminations of million primarily due to higher allocations of corporate depreciation to the business segments as an operating expense 
we did not have depreciable assets recorded at the partnership level until third quarter revenues from product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in gross margin from these transactions of million 
the gross margin resulting from product sales and purchases for the period increased million compared to gross margin for the period of million  resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the gross margin increase in primarily reflects increased product sales from our acquisition of the petroleum products blending operation in july the amount of product sales and product purchases increased substantially during primarily as a result of the third party supply agreement we assumed as part of our october pipeline system acquisition 
while we had no equity earnings in  equity earnings were million during the year ended december  as a result of our acquisition of a interest in a crude oil pipeline company in march operating margin increased by million  or  primarily due to incremental operating results associated with acquisitions and improved utilization of our other assets 
operating margin also improved due to lower transition expenses during associated with the change in control of our general partner in june depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  primarily related to the additional depreciation expense associated with assets acquired during affiliate g a expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decline of million  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the following items million lower incentive compensation expense during  primarily because of the early vesting of restricted units in under our equity based compensation plan as a result of the change in control of our general partner  and million lower transition costs associated with the separation of our g a functions from the former owner of our general partner 
during  the transition costs were million  which principally related to a benefits accrual and creation of our stand alone information technology functions 
comparatively  the period included million of transition costs 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the amount of affiliate g a expense we record 
excluding non cash incentive compensation expense  our actual cash outlay for g a costs is determined by an agreement with the owner of our general partner 
the owner of our general partner reimburses us for any g a expenses in excess of this amount up to a certain limit 
we record total g a costs  including the amount that is reimbursed by the owner of our general partner  as an expense  and we record the excess amount for which we are reimbursed as a capital contribution by our general partner 
prior to the change in control of our general partner during june  we were unable to identify specific costs required to support our operations 
as a result  we recorded only our actual cash g a costs and non cash expenses for our equity based incentive plan as expense in our financial results 
due to the change in our organizational structure following the change in control of our general partner in june  we could clearly identify all of our g a expenses 
for and  our actual cash outlay for g a costs was million and million  respectively  based on the agreement with our general partner 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings decreased slightly from for the period to in the period due in part to our may debt refinancing 
our average debt outstanding increased from million during to million during primarily due to the financing associated with our october pipeline system acquisition 
net refinancing costs associated with our may debt placement were million 
these costs included a million debt prepayment premium related to the early extinguishment of a portion of our previously outstanding magellan pipeline notes and a million non cash write off for unamortized debt placement fees associated with the retired debt 
partially offsetting these charges was a million gain on an interest rate hedge related to the refinancing 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures during  net cash provided by operating activities exceeded distributions paid and net maintenance capital requirements by million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for and million for the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from the third party supply agreement we assumed in connection with our october pipeline system acquisition  a decrease in accrued product shortages of million in compared to an increase in of million  and a decrease in cash collateral associated with our third party supply agreement of million in compared to an increase in cash collateral in of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased net income of million largely resulting from our october pipeline system acquisition  acquisitions over the past year  higher gross margin from product sales and improved utilization of our other assets  and an increase in accrued product purchases of million primarily due to the increase in inventory described above 
the million increase from to was primarily attributable to increased net income of million including results from our operations associated with the pipeline system we acquired in october  a million prepayment premium during on a portion of our magellan pipeline notes  which reduced net income but was classified as cash from financing activities  collection of million during related to our indemnification settlement agreement  an increase in our equity based incentive compensation liability in versus of million primarily due to the settlement of awards during related to the change in control of our general partner  and million lower cash payments in as compared to payments made during associated with our separation from the former owner of our general partner 
net cash used by investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  we acquired a marine terminal in wilmington  delaware for million and petroleum products pipeline system terminals in wichita  kansas and aledo  texas for million on a combined basis 
in addition  we spent million to buy out of obligations related to a portion of our third party supply agreement and million for capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
these cash expenditures were partially offset by our sales of marketable securities which  net of purchases  generated million of cash 
during  our net investments in marketable securities used million of cash 
in addition  we acquired the following assets during i ownership in petroleum products terminals located in the southeastern united states for million  ii a ownership in a crude oil pipeline company for million  and iii petroleum products pipeline system assets for million plus million of incurred transaction costs and million for inventory 
during  we acquired our petroleum products blending operation and related inventory for million 
total maintenance capital expenditures before indemnifications and reimbursements were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided used by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash was used during primarily to pay cash distributions to our unitholders 
cash provided during principally included the debt and equity financings that were completed in conjunction with our pipeline system acquisition in october  partially offset by the repayment of debt in connection with our may refinancing and cash distributions paid 
cash was used during primarily to pay cash distributions to our unitholders 
during  we paid million in cash distributions to our unitholders 
the quarterly distribution amount associated with the fourth quarter of was per unit 
if we continue to pay cash distributions at this current level and the number of outstanding units remains the same  total cash distributions of million will be paid to our unitholders in  of which million  or  would be related to our general partner s ownership interest and incentive distribution rights 
capital requirements our businesses require continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations 
capital spending for our businesses consists primarily of maintenance capital expenditures  such as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and expansion capital expenditures to acquire additional complementary assets to grow our business and to expand or upgrade our existing facilities  referred to as organic growth projects 
organic growth projects include capital expenditures that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources 
during  our maintenance capital spending was million  excluding the following million for environmental projects that would have been covered by indemnifications settled in may by our indemnification settlement agreement 
we have received million through december  pursuant to this agreement  and million for security enhancements at our marine terminal facilities for which we were reimbursed by the us government 
for  we expect to incur maintenance capital expenditures for our existing businesses of approximately million  excluding million of maintenance capital that would have been covered by the indemnification discussed above 
in addition to maintenance capital expenditures  we also incur expansion capital expenditures at our existing facilities 
during  we spent cash of approximately million for organic growth opportunities and million for acquisitions 
based on projects currently underway or in advanced stages of development  we plan to spend at least million on organic growth capital spending in  exclusive of amounts associated with future acquisitions 
liquidity cash generated from operations is our primary source of liquidity for funding debt service  maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions 
additional liquidity for purposes other than quarterly distributions is available through borrowings under our revolving credit facility discussed below  as well as from other borrowings or issuances of debt or limited partner units 
if capital markets do not permit us to issue additional debt and equity  our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses 
as of december   total debt reported on our consolidated balance sheet was million  as described below 
the difference between this amount and the million face value of our outstanding debt is due to adjustments associated with the fair value hedges we have in place for a portion of our outstanding senior notes and unamortized discounts on debt issuances 
in may  we completed a refinancing plan that improved our financial flexibility by providing for the release of the collateral previously securing our debt 
this refinancing plan further served to reduce the weighted average interest rate we incur and lowered our outstanding debt 
in october  we borrowed million under a short term acquisition facility and million under our revolving credit facility to partially finance the pipeline system we acquired 
we repaid these borrowings in october using proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
our short term acquisition facility was cancelled at that time 
senior notes due on october   we sold million of senior notes due in an underwritten public offering as part of the long term financing of the pipeline system assets we acquired in october the notes were issued at of par  and we received proceeds after underwriters fees and expenses of approximately million 
including the impact of pre issuance hedges associated with these notes and the swap of million of the notes from fixed rate to floating rate  the weighted average interest rate on the notes at december  was 
senior notes due on may   we sold million of senior notes due in an underwritten public offering at of par 
we received proceeds after underwriters fees and expenses of approximately million 
including the impact of pre issuance hedges associated with these notes  the effective interest rate on these notes at december  was 
the indentures under which both the and notes were issued do not limit our ability to incur additional unsecured debt 
the indentures contain covenants limiting  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness secured by certain liens  engage in certain sale leaseback transactions  and consolidate  merge or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
we are in compliance with these covenants 
magellan pipeline notes 
in connection with the long term financing of our acquisition of magellan pipeline  we and magellan pipeline entered into a note purchase agreement on october  the million borrowed under this agreement included series a and series b senior notes 
the series a senior notes included million of borrowings that incurred interest based on the six month eurodollar rate plus 
the series b senior notes included million of borrowings that incur interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
our membership interests in and the assets of magellan pipeline initially secured this debt 
as a result of our may refinancing  we repaid the million outstanding balance of the series a senior notes and we incurred million of associated prepayment premiums 
further  in exchange for a million payment  the series b noteholders released the collateral that secured these notes  except for cash deposited monthly by magellan pipeline into a cash escrow account in anticipation of semi annual interest payments 
the weighted average interest rate for the series b senior notes  including the impact of the swap of million of the notes from fixed rate to floating rate  was approximately at december  the maturity date of these notes is october   with scheduled prepayments equal to of the outstanding balance on october  and october  magellan pipeline repaid million of these notes on october  in connection with the first scheduled prepayment 
we guarantee payment of interest and principal by magellan pipeline 
the note purchase agreement under which these notes were issued  as amended during our may refinancing  requires magellan pipeline to maintain specified ratios of i consolidated debt to ebitda of no greater than to  and ii consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least to 
it also requires us to maintain specified ratios of i consolidated debt to ebitda of no greater than to  and ii consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least to 
in addition  the note purchase agreement contains additional covenants that limit magellan pipeline s ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  encumber its assets  make debt or equity investments  make loans or advances  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate  liquidate or dissolve  sell or lease a material portion of its assets  engage in sale and leaseback transactions and change the nature of its business 
we are in compliance with these covenants 
revolving credit facility 
in connection with our may refinancing  we entered into a five year million revolving credit facility  which we subsequently increased to million in september borrowings under this facility are unsecured and bear interest at libor plus a spread ranging from to based upon our credit ratings 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility  and million of the facility was obligated for letters of credit 
the obligations for letters of credit are not reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this facility was 
the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt to ebitda of no greater than to  and consolidated ebitda to interest expense of at least to in addition  the facility contains other covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  encumber our assets  make certain investments  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  merge  consolidate  liquidate  dissolve or dispose of all of our assets or change the nature of our business 
we are in compliance with these covenants 
interest rate derivatives 
we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
in conjunction with our existing debt instruments  we were engaged in the following derivative transactions as of december  in october  we entered into a million interest rate swap agreement to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our senior notes due this agreement effectively changes the interest rate on million of those notes to a floating rate of six month libor plus  with libor set in arrears 
this swap agreement expires on october   the maturity date of the senior notes  and in may  we entered into million of interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the magellan pipeline series b senior notes 
these agreements effectively change the interest rate on million of the series b senior notes from a fixed rate of to a floating rate of six month libor plus  with libor set in arrears 
these swap agreements expire on october   the maturity date of the magellan pipeline series b senior notes 
debt to total capitalization 
the ratio of debt to total capitalization is a measure frequently used by the financial community to assess the reasonableness of a company s debt levels compared to its total capitalization  which is calculated by adding total debt and total partners capital 
based on the figures shown in our balance sheet  debt to total capitalization was at december  because accounting rules required the acquisition of a portion of magellan pipeline to be recorded at historical book values due to the then affiliate nature of the transaction  the million difference between the purchase price and book value at the time of the acquisition was recorded as a decrease to our general partner s capital account  thus lowering our overall partners capital by that amount 
credit ratings 
our current corporate credit ratings are bbb by standard and poor s and baa by moody s investor services 
off balance sheet arrangements none contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions total years long term and current debt obligations interest obligations operating lease obligations pension and post retirement medical obligations purchase commitments affiliate operating and g a petroleum product purchases derivative financial instruments equity based incentive awards environmental remediation capital project purchase obligations other purchase obligations other total excludes market value adjustments to long term debt associated with qualifying hedges 
for purposes of this table  we have assumed that the borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december  million will not be repaid until the maturity date of the facility 
we have an agreement with affiliates of our general partner to provide our direct operating and g a services 
this agreement has provisions for termination upon day notice by either party 
as a result of the termination provisions of this agreement and the requirement to pay only actual costs as they are incurred  we are unable to determine the actual amount of these commitments 
the amount we paid for operating and g a costs during was million 
we have an agreement to supply a customer with approximately  barrels of petroleum products per month until the agreement expires in related to this supply agreement  we have entered into certain forward contracts to purchase various petroleum products based on future product prices 
this amount is an estimated value of our product purchase commitments at december   based on projected product prices 
on december   we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the fair value of million of our long term debt 
because future cash outflows under these agreements  if any  are uncertain  they have been excluded from this table 
represents amounts we have accrued for equity based incentive compensation through december  based on when those existing liabilities will be settled 
we expect the amounts that will ultimately vest to our employees will exceed these amounts due to anticipated compensation liabilities that will be recognized over the remainder of the vesting periods and changes in our unit prices between december  and the date the unit awards actually vest 
on december   we entered into a year agreement to reach contractual endpoint as defined in the agreement for remediation sites 
this contract obligates us to pay the remediation costs incurred by the contract counterparty associated with these sites up to a maximum of million 
the amounts included in the table above represent our accrued environmental liabilities  as of december   associated with these sites 
for purposes of this table  we have assumed that these costs will be incurred ratably over the year contract term 
environmental various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations subject us to environmental laws and regulations 
we have accrued liabilities for estimated known site restoration costs to be incurred in the future at our facilities and properties  including liabilities for environmental remediation obligations at various sites where we have been identified as a possible responsible party 
under our accounting policies  we record liabilities when site restoration and environmental remediation obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
prior to may  the williams companies  inc williams provided indemnifications to us for assets we previously acquired from it 
the indemnifications primarily related to environmental items for periods during which williams was the owner of those assets 
in may  we entered into an agreement with williams under which williams agreed to pay us million to release it from those indemnification obligations 
to date  we have received million from williams and expect to receive the remaining balance in installments of million and million on july of and  respectively 
as of december   known liabilities that would have been covered by these indemnifications were million 
in addition  we have spent million through december  that would have been covered by these indemnifications  including million of capital costs 
at the time of mgg s purchase of our general partner interest in june  mgg assumed obligations to indemnify us for million of known environmental liabilities 
through december   we have incurred million of costs associated with this indemnification obligation  leaving a remaining liability of million 
our receivable balance with mgg on december  was million 
in july  the environmental protection agency epa  pursuant to section of the clean water act the act served an information request to williams based on a preliminary determination that williams may have systematic problems with petroleum discharges from pipeline operations 
that inquiry primarily focused on magellan pipeline  which we subsequently acquired in april the response to the epa s information request was submitted during november in march  we received an additional information request from the epa and notice from the us department of justice doj that the epa had requested the doj to initiate a lawsuit alleging violations of section b of the act in regards to releases 
the doj stated that the maximum statutory penalty for the releases was in excess of million  which assumes that all releases are violations of the act and that the epa would impose the maximum penalty 
the epa further indicated that some of those spills also may have violated the spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of section j of the act and that additional penalties may be assessed 
in addition  we may incur additional costs associated with these spills if the epa were to successfully seek and obtain injunctive relief 
we have submitted all information requested to date 
we have met with the epa and the doj and anticipate negotiating a final settlement with both agencies in we have accrued an amount that is less than million associated with this matter 
due to the uncertainties described above  it is reasonably possible that the amounts we have recorded for this environmental liability could change in the near term 
management is unable to determine with any accuracy what those amounts could be and they could be material to our results of operations and cash flows 
other items ownership changes 
during  mgg sold its remaining limited partner interests in us 
mgg continues to own our general partner interest  representing a ownership in us 
due to the trading activity of our limited partner units  we believe that more than of the total interests in our capital and profits had been sold or exchanged over the month period ending april because of this  we were terminated for federal income tax purposes and immediately reconstituted as a new partnership  causing a significant reduction in the amount of depreciation deductions allocable to our unitholders in as a result  we estimate that for only the tax year our unitholders as of april were allocated an increased amount of federal taxable income as a percentage of cash distributed to them 
new board member 
during may  our general partner s board of directors appointed john p 
desbarres as an independent board member  replacing mark g 
papa who resigned from this position due to conflicting time commitments 
variable rate terminalling agreement 
we had a terminalling agreement with a third party customer under which we provided storage rental and throughput fees based on discounted rates plus a variable fee  which was based on a percentage of the net profits from certain trading activities conducted by our customer 
under this agreement which expired on january   we recognized the storage rental and throughput fees as the services were performed  however  we would not receive revenue from the variable fee if the net trading profits fell below a specified amount or were negative 
we earned approximately million related to the shared trading profits which was not determinable until the end of the contract term 
we elected to defer the recognition of this revenue until the end of the contract term 
as a result of settling this agreement  our terminals revenues  operating profit and net income will be favorably impacted by approximately million during the first quarter of while we expect to continue to negotiate similar terminalling arrangements in the future  we cannot predict what future revenues  if any  will be recognized from such arrangements 
hurricane impact 
hurricanes katrina and rita struck the gulf coast area of the united states during third quarter  resulting in damage to the petroleum industry s infrastructure in that region 
many refineries in the houston  texas area shut down operations in preparation for the pending storms 
our assets sustained only minor damage from these hurricanes  including two docks at our marrero  louisiana marine terminal 
although this terminal remains operational  we are in the process of replacing the damaged docks 
supply disruptions of petroleum products occurred following the hurricanes because of delays in the return of gulf coast refineries to historical operating levels 
although we did experience lower transportation volumes on our petroleum products pipeline system and reduced throughput at our inland terminals during fourth quarter  our financial results were not materially impacted 
galena park marine terminal expansion 
during late and early  we executed a series of long term terminalling agreements with several customers  which will require us to construct new storage tanks at our galena park  texas marine terminal 
tank construction has begun and we expect the new tanks to be placed into service during and we believe these new agreements will significantly contribute to our results of operations and cash flows once construction is complete and the new tanks have been placed into service 
line break and product release 
on january   we experienced a line break and product release of approximately  barrels from our petroleum products pipeline near independence  kansas 
we are in the process of estimating the repair and remediation costs associated with the release 
we have insurance coverage for this incident with a deductible of million 
we are unable to estimate with any degree of certainty what penalties  if any  might be assessed by the epa or other governmental agency  associated with this release  which would not be covered by our insurance policy 
our net cost for repair and remediation plus any penalties that may be assessed could be material to our results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation inflation is a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass through increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees 
critical accounting estimates our management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed and approved these disclosures 
environmental liabilities we estimate the liabilities associated with environmental expenditures based on site specific project plans for remediation  taking into account prior remediation experience 
remediation project managers evaluate each known case of environmental liability to determine what associated costs can be reasonably estimated and to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements 
we believe the accounting estimate relative to environmental remediation costs to be a critical accounting estimate because estimated expenditures  which will generally be made over the next one to ten years  are subject to cost fluctuations and could change materially  unanticipated third party liabilities may arise and changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations could significantly increase the amount of the liability 
the estimate for environmental liabilities is a critical accounting estimate for all three of our operating segments 
a defined process for project reviews is integrated into our system integrity plan 
specifically  our remediation project managers meet once a year with accounting  operations  legal and other personnel to evaluate  in detail  the known environmental liabilities associated with each of our operating units 
the purpose of the annual project review is to assess all aspects of each project  evaluating what actions will be required to achieve regulatory compliance  estimating the costs associated with executing the regulatory phases that can be reasonably estimated and estimating the timing for those expenditures 
during the site specific evaluations  all known information is utilized in conjunction with professional judgment and experience to determine the appropriate approach to remediation and to assess liabilities 
the general remediation process to achieve regulatory compliance consists of site investigation delineation  site remediation and long term monitoring 
each of these phases can  and often does  include unknown variables that complicate the task of evaluating the estimated costs to completion 
each quarter  we re evaluate our environmental estimates taking into account any new incidents that have occurred since the last annual meeting of the remediation project managers  any changes in the site situation and additional findings or changes in federal or state regulations 
the estimated environmental liability accruals are adjusted as necessary 
changes in our environmental liabilities since december  are as follows in millions balance balance balance accruals expenditures accruals expenditures in may  we entered into an agreement with williams under which williams agreed to pay us million to release williams from its environmental and certain other indemnification obligations to us 
from the effective date of our environmental indemnification settlement with williams  all accrual adjustments associated with amounts that would have been previously indemnified by williams are no longer reimbursed and therefore reduce our net income 
during  we increased our environmental liability accruals by million as a result of a million of environmental liabilities assumed through acquisitions completed during the year  b an increase of million associated with a product release in the kansas city area  c a notification we received during from the epa of its intent to assess penalties against us related to certain specified pipeline releases  and d the quarterly and annual site assessments by our remediation project managers 
during  we increased our environmental liability accruals by million  of which million related to pipeline product releases  million related to acquisitions and the remainder was primarily attributable to our annual site assessment process 
our known environmental liabilities at december  are based on estimates that are subject to change  and any changes to these estimates would impact our results of operations and financial position 
for example  if our environmental liabilities increased by as much as and assuming that none of this increase was covered by indemnifications or insurance  our expenses would increase by million 
because we pay no income taxes  operating profit and net income would decrease by the same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and of our net income for assuming our current distribution levels for the entire year  this additional expense would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would increase our liabilities and decrease equity by approximately 
the impact of such an increase in environmental costs would likely not affect our liquidity because  even with the increased costs  we would still comply with the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
depreciation methods and estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the asset s estimated useful life 
depreciation is the systematic and rational allocation of an asset s cost  less its residual value if any  to the periods it benefits 
straight line depreciation results in depreciation expense being incurred evenly over the life of the asset 
at december  and  the net book value of our property  plant and equipment was billion and billion  respectively  and we recorded depreciation expense of million and million during and  respectively 
the determination of an asset s estimated useful life takes a number of factors into consideration  including technological change  normal depreciation and actual physical usage 
if any of these assumptions subsequently change  the estimated useful life of the asset could change and result in an increase or decrease in depreciation expense 
our terminals  pipelines and related equipment have estimated useful lives of three to years  with a weighted average asset life of approximately years 
if the estimates of our asset lives changed such that the average estimated asset life was years  our depreciation expense for would increase by million 
because we pay no income taxes  operating profit and net income would decrease by the same amount  which represents a decrease of of our operating profit and of our net income for assuming our current distribution levels for the entire year  this additional expense would reduce both basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit by approximately 
such a change would decrease total assets by less than and equity by approximately 
the impact of such an increase in depreciation costs would likely not have affected our liquidity because  even with the increased costs  we would still comply with the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity

 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this fsp requires entities who incur rental costs associated with operating leases to expense such costs as a continuing operating expense 
this fsp is required to be implemented beginning january   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the fsp on january   and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
in eitf no 
 the fasb reached a tentative conclusion that inventory purchases and sales transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined for purposes of applying apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the tentative conclusions reached by the fasb are required to be applied to transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after march  the adoption of this eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb published statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in nondiscretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
we adopted this sfas no 
in january  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as amended 
this interpretation clarified that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin no

in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 share based payment  referred to as sfas no 
r 
additionally  in october  the fasb issued fsp r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
this statement and subsequent revisions establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this sfas requires that all equity based compensation awards to employees be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values  eliminating the alternative to use apb no 
s intrinsic value method 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that begins after december  sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date but is not to be applied to awards granted in periods before the required effective date except to the extent that awards from prior periods are modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective method  we were required to account for all of our equity based incentive awards granted prior to january   using the fair value method as defined in sfas no 
instead of our current methodology of using the intrinsic value method as defined in apb no 
due to the structure of our awards  we recognize compensation expense under apb no 
in much the same manner as that required under sfas no 
consequently  for the awards granted prior to january   the initial adoption and application of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb no 
the guidance in apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this sfas amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the initial adoption and application of sfas no

 earnings per share 
eitf addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by entities that have issued securities other than common units that contractually entitle the holder to participate in distributions and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares distributions on its common units 
eitf no 
also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share  clarifying what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing earnings per share once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
eitf no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not have foreign exchange risks 
we have established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
we also enter into derivative agreements to help manage our exposure to commodity price and interest rate risks 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no variable interest debt outstanding  however  because of certain interest rate swap agreements discussed below  we are exposed to million of interest rate market risk 
if interest rates change by  our annual interest expense would change by million 
during may  we entered into four separate interest rate swap agreements to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the magellan pipeline series b senior notes 
we have accounted for these interest rate hedges as fair value hedges 
the notional amounts of the interest rate swap agreements total million 
under the terms of the agreements  we receive the interest rate of the magellan pipeline series b senior notes and pay libor plus
