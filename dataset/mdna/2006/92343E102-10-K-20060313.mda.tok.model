overview verisign  inc is a leading provider of intelligent infrastructure services that enable and protect billions of interactions everyday across the world s voice and data networks 
in and  our business consisted of two reportable segments the internet services group and the communications services group 
prior to  our business included an additional reportable segment  the network solutions domain name registrar business  which was sold in november improving economic conditions during in the us  europe and japan led to improved it spending for security services and e commerce activity in those markets 
we also saw continued growth in domain name registrations and domain name renewals  with active domain names ending in 
com and 
net increasing by during communication services group revenues increased significantly primarily due to increases in content services revenues during the year 
this increase was due primarily to recognizing a full year of revenue coupled with significant growth in our content business for the year 
our content business grew in the second  third and fourth quarters of compared to the comparable periods in  however  revenues decreased sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of due to increased competition  pricing pressures and a decline in the number of subscribers 
we derive the majority of our revenues and cash flows from a relatively small number of services sold primarily in the united states  europe and japan 
in the internet services group  more than of the revenues during were derived from the sale of registry services  managed authentication and security services and web certificates 
in the communications services group  approximately of the revenues were derived from the sale of content services  signaling services  ss connectivity  billing services and calling name services during the same period 
for the communications services group  we expect content services revenues to decline in the first quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  and expect connectivity  clearing and settlement  and billing related revenues to be unchanged 
increased competition and continued consolidation in the telecommunications sector has increased pricing pressures and will continue to have the potential to adversely impact the communications services group s results 
for the internet services group  we expect continued growth in the levels of it spending for security services by our customers in the us  europe and japan and continued growth in domain name registrations and renewals that we believe will result in revenue and deferred revenue growth for the first quarter of

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  long lived assets  restructuring  stock based compensation  royalty liabilities  and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition requirements are complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to the products and services to be provided 
our assumptions and judgments regarding products and services could differ from actual events 
revenues from our consulting services are recognized using either the proportional performance method or on a time and materials basis as work is performed 
proportional performance is based upon the ratio of hours incurred to total hours estimated to be incurred for the project 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the hours required to complete projects 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
revenues from time and materials contracts are recognized as services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors described above 
in addition  we maintain a general reserve for certain invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
we require all acquired companies to adopt our credit policies 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or approximately million 
a change of in our estimate would amount to approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles our long lived assets consist primarily of goodwill  other intangible assets and property and equipment 
we review  at least annually  goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 

table of contents we review long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of long lived assets other than goodwill is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled approximately billion at december   which was comprised of billion of goodwill and billion of other intangible assets 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  technology in place  carrier relationships  non compete agreements  trade names  and other 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of our acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of an intangible asset may be impaired  an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this assessment indicates that an intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations  of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
it is our policy to engage third party valuation consultants to assist us in the measurement of the fair value of our long lived intangible assets including goodwill 
restructuring and other charges in november  we initiated a restructuring plan related to the sale of our network solutions business and the realignment of other business units 
in april  we initiated plans to restructure our operations to fully rationalize  integrate and align our resources 
both plans resulted in reductions in workforce  abandonment of excess facilities  disposal of property and equipment and other charges 
we expect these restructuring plans to be completed in upon the expiration of our lease obligations for abandoned facilities 
restructuring charges take into account the fair value of lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
during  we recorded net restructuring reversals of approximately million related to excess facilities as a result of reductions in lease obligations 
such estimates will likely be revised in the future 
if sublease rates continue to change in these markets  or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the actual lease expense could exceed this estimate by an additional million over the next nine years relating to our restructuring plans 
accounting for stock based incentive programs through december   we measured compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  we did not record compensation expense when 
table of contents stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted 
we also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
to determine the pro forma impact of applying sfas  we estimated the fair value of our options using the black scholes option valuation model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price 
the assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  sfas r  share based payment  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in their consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of operations and net income per share 
provision for royalty liabilities for intellectual property rights certain of our content services utilize intellectual property owned or held under license by others 
where we have not yet entered into a license agreement with the owner or license holder  we record a provision for royalty payments that we estimate will be due once a license agreement is concluded 
we estimate the royalty payments based on the prevailing royalty rate for the type of intellectual property being utilized 
our estimates could differ materially from the actual royalties to be paid under any definitive license agreements that may be reached due to changes in the market for such intellectual property  such as a change in demand for a particular type of content  in which case we would record a royalty expense materially different than our estimate 
income taxes we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded 

table of contents in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value of an asset 
there was no impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets from the annual impairment tests conducted in june and the annual impairment test conducted in june resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets of million during the second quarter of we recorded an additional impairment of goodwill of million in the third quarter of as a result of entering into an agreement to sell our network solutions business 
the event triggered an evaluation of the carrying value of the goodwill assigned to network solutions 
after considering the sales price of the assets and liabilities to be sold and the expenses associated with the divestiture  we determined that the carrying value exceeded the implied fair value of network solutions goodwill

minority interest minority interest represents the portion of net income belonging to minority shareholders of our consolidated subsidiaries 

table of contents a comparison of minority interest for the years ended december  and is presented below change change dollars in thousands minority interest fiscal compared to fiscal minority interest increased primarily from increased net income from our verisign japan subsidiary primarily due to an increase in the installed base of website security certificates and increased demand for managed security services in japan

other income expense  net other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and investments  gains and losses on the sale or impairment of equity investments  and the net effect of foreign currency gains and losses 
the following table presents the components of other income  net for years ended december   and change change interest income net gain impairment on sale of investments  net of impairments gains gain on sale of verisign japan stock other  net total other income  net fiscal compared to fiscal other income decreased approximately million primarily due to the gain on sale of verisign japan of approximately million recorded in  partially offset by an increase in realized gains on investments  net of losses and impairments  in  of approximately million

income tax expense in the years ended december   and  we recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of million  or of pretax income  million  or of pretax income  and million  or of pretax loss  respectively 
our effective tax rates differ from the united states federal statutory rate of primarily due to state taxes  acquisition related expenses  the realization of domestic net operating loss  capital loss  and research credit carryforwards  and the impact of foreign operations 

table of contents in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors  including our past earnings and the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities 
management does not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to us federal and state operations are realizable 
however  depending on our continued ability to achieve profitability  and on the potential impact of sfas r  we may have sufficient evidence in to conclude that realization of additional deferred tax assets is more likely than not and thus realize a tax benefit in that period from a reduction of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
if the valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets were released as of december   approximately million would be credited to the statement of operations  and million would be credited to additional paid in capital 
management would continue to apply a valuation allowance of million to the deferred tax asset relating to the write down of investments  due to the limited carryover life and character of such tax attributes 
management does not believe it is more likely than not that million of deferred tax assets relating to certain foreign operations are realizable  therefore  a valuation allowance is applied to the deferred tax asset 
on the remaining foreign operations  management believes it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized  accordingly  a valuation allowance was not applied on these assets 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
if we are not able to use them  the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through most of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire  but could be subject to future restrictions based on changes in the business or ownership of the foreign subsidiary 
we had research and experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately million available for carryover to future years  and for state income tax purposes of approximately million available for carryover to future years 
the federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire  if not utilized  in through state research and experimentation tax credits carry forward indefinitely until utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
we experienced cumulative changes in ownership of greater than percent in and these changes in ownership resulted in the imposition of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize us federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
losses not utilized due to these limitations can be carried forward  but are subject to the expiration dates described in the prior paragraph 
in the consolidated balance sheets  we have not included deferred tax assets of million for a capital loss carryforward  and million for a net operating loss generated by stock options 
the capital loss and the net operating loss generated by the stock options are each subject to a ruling request currently on file with the irs and will be allowed if and when we receive a favorable ruling 
if the irs issues favorable rulings to us  the deferred tax assets could be recognized and  if recognized  the million will be credited to income tax expense and the million will be credited to additional paid in capital 
the outcome of these ruling requests is uncertain as the rulings are solely dependent on the irs discretion

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk equity investments we invest in debt and equity securities of technology companies for investment purposes 
in most instances  we invest in the equity and debt securities of private companies for which there is no public market  and therefore  carry a high level of risk 
these companies are typically in the early stage of development and are expected to incur substantial losses in the near term 
therefore  these companies may never become publicly traded 
even if they do  an active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never realize any return on these investments 
in  and  we determined the decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary and we recognized impairments totaling million  million  and million  respectively 
due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  we may incur future losses on the sale or impairment of our investments 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our cash management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and driving after tax returns 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize interest rate risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate bonds and notes  us government and agency securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our investments subject to interest rate risk mature in less than one year 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   this would not materially change the fair market value of our portfolio 

table of contents the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to interest rate risk 
maturing in total estimated fair value six months or less six months to one year more than one year dollars in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in restricted cash and investments weighted average interest rate foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
as we continue to expand our international operations we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate risks 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a foreign currency risk management program designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
at december   we held forward contracts in notional amounts totaling approximately million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
all forward contracts are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with high quality financial institutions
