discontinued operations during the third quarter of  we approved a plan to sell our wholly owned subsidiary bisys education services  inc accordingly  results of operations of the education services business have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in connection with the approval of the plan to sell the education services business  we determined that circumstances warranted that a recoverability assessment also be conducted of the tangible and intangible assets of the education services business 
we performed an impairment analysis and calculated the estimated fair value of the education services business using a combination of discounted cash flows and market based information  including the range of expected values of the business in a sale transaction 
based on that assessment  we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a pretax impairment charge to goodwill in the third quarter of of million

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about debt and related matters 
included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment operating leases  and software license agreements 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment 
the majority of lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
certain leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices 
future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or enter into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations primarily relate to maintenance agreements on software  equipment and other assets 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we entered into a four year senior unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the facility was created to support working capital requirements  repurchases of our common stock  and the funding of acquisitions and initially contained a million revolving line of credit facility and a million term loan 
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at prime or  at our option  libor plus a margin 
the credit agreement required us to pay an annual facility fee of on the total revolving credit commitment 
the facility was guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the bisys group  inc at june   we had outstanding borrowings of million against the term loan portion of the facility  which was repaid in full in december our debt ratio total debt total debt plus equity was at june   and the company s maximum debt ratio was not to exceed under the terms of the revolving credit facility 
at june   the weighted average interest rate of the credit facility borrowings was 
the credit agreement required us to maintain certain financial covenants and limited our ability to incur future indebtedness and to pay dividends 
as of june   no amounts were permitted for the payment of cash dividends 
as of june   a default existed under the facility resulting from our failure to timely file our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  and our failure to deliver the related compliance certificate for such fiscal quarter 
on june   we obtained a consent and waiver from the lenders under the facility  which extended the cure period arising from these defaults to august  after obtaining additional consents and waivers from the lenders subsequent to june   the facility was eventually terminated by us in january and replaced with a new interim credit facility see note establishment of new credit facility 
as a condition of the waivers  additional borrowings under the revolving line of credit were not permitted until the default was cured 
in january  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders  providing for i an interim revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to million the revolver and ii an interim term loan in an aggregate amount of up to million the term loan  together with the revolver  the interim facility 
the maturity date of the interim facility is january  the proceeds of the revolver may be used for working capital and other corporate purposes 
the term loan commitment was subsequently cancelled since the proceeds were no longer required to repay the million of notes 
borrowings at june  also included million of convertible subordinated notes due march in march  we used the net proceeds from the sale of the information services segment for the repayment of these notes see note acquisitions and dispositions 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
while changes in the interest rates could decrease our interest income or increase our interest expense  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates based on the relative size of our interest bearing assets and liabilities 
we do not undertake any specific actions concerning exposure to interest rate risk  and we are not party to any interest rate derivative transactions 
we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to manage our foreign exchange risk 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and are recognized as earnings in the same period as the items that they generally offset 
our strategy includes the acquisition of complementary businesses financed by a combination of internally generated funds  borrowings from the revolving credit facility  long term debt  and common stock 
our policy is to retain earnings to support future business opportunities  rather than pay dividends 
we have historically used a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures with any remainder used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility or repurchase our own common stock 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the million revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our funding requirements 
in the event that we make significant future acquisitions  we may raise funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of securities 
accounts receivable represented and days sales outstanding dso at june  and  respectively  based on quarterly revenues 
the calculation of dso for accounts receivable excludes insurance premiums and commissions receivable arising from our insurance related business 
dso is less relevant for this type of receivable because it includes premiums that are ultimately remitted to the insurer and not recognized as revenue 
additionally  certain life insurance commissions due from insurance carriers have customary collection terms of up to twelve months 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers in conjunction with our new business development processes 
the customers are assessed for credit worthiness based on their financial position  and payment terms are generally negotiated at the time contracts are signed 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable position relative to our revenues and monitor our accounts receivable aging as part of managing our receivable portfolio 
credit risk is generally mitigated by reasonably short payment terms  the nature of our customers ie  commercial banks  mutual funds  and insurance carriers and our large and diverse customer base 
we generally do not require collateral for accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at june  and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates in the near term 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimate and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
goodwill we have recorded goodwill that was initially recognized as a result of business combinations 
in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we periodically evaluate goodwill for impairment no less than annually by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our process for estimating a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
assumed growth rates generally ranged from to and varied by reporting unit based upon near and medium term growth opportunities 
the assumed weighted average cost of capital approximated in the most recent analyses 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimate of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
we have approximately million of goodwill as of june   none of which is considered impaired  based on impairment testing 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to the financial statements 
acquired intangible assets we have recorded intangible assets that were initially recognized as a result of business combinations or acquired customer relationships 
the intangible assets are amortized on either a pattern of consumption or a straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we assess the likelihood of recovering the cost of acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate  for impairment  the carrying value of acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value to the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the intangible asset 
if an intangible asset is impaired  the asset is written down to fair value 
intangible assets resulting from acquired customer relationships are evaluated in light of actual customer attrition rates and related cash flows to ensure that the carrying value of these intangibles assets is recoverable 
significant changes in these customer relationships could result in an impairment charge 
we have approximately million of acquired intangible assets as of june  given the significance of intangibles  adverse changes to these relationships could result in an impairment charge that could be material to the financial statements 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the financial statements 
we also record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
legal and regulatory contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including securities class action lawsuits  a shareholder derivative lawsuit  and regulatory investigations 
gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance 
we analyze our litigation exposure and determine estimates for anticipated regulatory settlements based on available information  including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters  to assess probable liability 
revenue recognition except as noted for software and related revenues described below  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements  is supplemented by the specific guidance provided for the specialized revenue recognition types addressed below 
our principal sources of service revenues include information processing and software services  administration and distribution of mutual funds  hedge funds and private equity funds  brokerage and consulting services  administration and record keeping of retirement plans  and commissions from insurance brokerage and distribution activities 
revenues from these services are recognized in the periods in which the services are performed or over the life of the customer contract 
we recognize revenues from certain services on either a gross or net basis based upon consideration of various factors or indicators as set forth in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
cash received by us in advance of the performance of services or the revenue being recognized is deferred 
we defer recognition of up front implementation and conversion fees that are not the culmination of a separate earnings process and recognize them ratably over the estimated customer life  generally between five and eight years 
data processing revenues revenues are recognized in accordance with sab and eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
data center information processing revenues are recognized based on monthly contractual minimum amounts or actual monthly usage by the customer 
implementation fees for ancillary products are generally recognized over six years  consistent with the amortization of related purchased software licenses 
in connection with our outsourcing arrangements  we often perform implementations  including the installation and customization of our proprietary software or third party software in our centers 
under these arrangements  a client does not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
we recognize all internal and contracted costs associated with information processing  implementation and conversion revenues as incurred 
termination fees are charged when customers cancel their outsourcing contract and are recognized ratably as revenue over the period from customer notification to the deconversion date 
we have agreements with third party vendors to resell the services of those third party vendors to our customers 
we are obligated to provide these services to certain of our customers  which include internet banking  telecommunication and other resold services  and we are considered the primary obligor 
in addition  we price these services independent of the amounts billed by the third party vendors  and we bear all collection risk for the amounts billed to our customers 
in accordance with eitf no 
 amounts earned from the resale of these services are recorded as revenue on a gross basis and the costs incurred from the third party service providers are recorded as service and operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
administration  distribution and record keeping revenues revenues earned from administration and distribution of mutual funds  hedge funds and private equity funds are  in some cases  based on the average net asset value or invested capital of the fund  subject to minimum charges  and in some cases consist of or include account based fees and other fixed charges 
revenues earned from record keeping services for retirement plans are generally based upon the number of eligible employees or participants in a plan subject to certain minimums  as well as fees based on assets held in the retirement plans  and transaction fees 
revenues from these services are recognized in the periods in which the services are performed 
insurance commission revenues commission revenue from insurance distribution operations is recognized when all placement services have been provided  protection is afforded under the insurance policy  and the premium is known or can be reasonably estimated and is billable  or when the policy renews or when incentive based targets are achieved 
commission revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated commission adjustments due to lapses  policy cancellations  and revisions in coverage 
in the life insurance division  insurance commissions earned from carriers are recorded net of amounts due to agents 
commission revenue from carriers and commissions payable to agents are generally recognized based on a percentage of the premium that the policyholder pays to the insurance carrier 
first year commissions are calculated based on a contractual percentage of the first year s premium 
renewal commissions relate to the periods following the first year and are paid at a contractual rate if the policy remains in force 
bonus commissions are paid by the insurance carrier in situations in which certain volume  persistency or profitability targets are met 
software and related revenues we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the aicpa 
revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been executed  fees are fixed or determinable  the software has been delivered and installed  accepted by the customer if acceptance is required by the contract and is other than perfunctory  and collection is considered probable 
we sell software licenses in conjunction with hardware and professional services for installation and maintenance 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable using the fair value of each of the deliverables determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe of fair value is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
in software arrangements in which we have fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element  the residual method is used to record revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element s and is recognized as revenue 
in software arrangements in which we do not have vsoe of fair value of all undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until fair value is determined  or until all elements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value have been delivered 
our software license agreements do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  and accordingly  installation and training services are not considered essential to functionality 
however  we do not have vsoe for our installation services so all hardware and software revenues are deferred until installation is complete 
revenues from training and other services are recognized as services are performed 
maintenance revenue consists of fees generated by providing software maintenance  unspecified upgrades and support to customers  such as telephone support and new releases of software and updated user documentation on a when and if available basis 
a customer typically prepays maintenance and support fees for an initial period  and the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of such initial period 
maintenance is renewable by the customer  and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the related support period  generally twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have material exposure to market risk from derivative or non derivative financial instruments 
we do not utilize such instruments to manage market risk exposures or for trading or speculative purposes 
we do  however  invest available cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
as of june   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents invested in highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less  including million of overnight repurchase agreements 
we believe that potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in the market rates for such instruments are not material to us 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
while changes in interest rates could decrease our interest income or increase our interest expense  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates based on the relative size of our interest bearing assets and liabilities 
we do not undertake any specific actions concerning exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate derivative transactions 
we conduct a portion of our business internationally exposing earnings  cash flows and financial position to foreign currency risks 
the majority of these risks are associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency 
our policy on foreign currency risk is to minimize these risks whenever possible  supplemented with foreign currency forward contracts 
during  the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to specifically identified operating expenses 
the contracts  totaling million in notional value  require the company to purchase currencies at specified rates over the next seven months million outstanding at june  
the instruments are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges of specifically identified euro denominated operating expenses
