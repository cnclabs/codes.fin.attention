item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we underwrite insurance and reinsurance on a global basis 
our business currently consists of two distinct global underwriting platforms axis insurance and axis re 
we have three reportable operating segments insurance  reinsurance and corporate 
our insurance segment is further sub divided into two sub segments global insurance and us insurance 
the markets in which we operate have historically been cyclical 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers and reinsurers 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers 
historically  underwriting capacity has been impacted by several factors  including industry losses  catastrophes  changes in legal and regulatory guidelines  investment results and the ratings and financial strength of competitors 
we believe that we are currently operating in a marketplace that  with appropriate risk selection  can offer favorable pricing and or terms and conditions in our business segments 
following the wake of record catastrophe losses incurred by the industry in  caused by hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  we have experienced significantly improved pricing terms and conditions in our short tail lines of business 
the most dramatic hardening  including major revisions of terms  conditions and structure  has occurred for business exposed to us wind perils 
this reflects the recalibration of catastrophe models and more disciplined underwriting  addressing assumptions regarding the potential for the frequency and severity of losses and increased capital requirements against loss scenarios 
despite the catastrophic events of the third and fourth quarters of  the aviation line of business continues to experience severe pricing competition 
this competition has resulted in our declining a substantial amount of aviation renewal business 
this business is largely incepted in the fourth quarter of each year and subsequently earned over the course of the following year 
for other short tail insurance and reinsurance business outside of the us  and for casualty insurance and reinsurance lines of business globally  pricing  terms and conditions are broadly stable and at or above the level required to produce target returns 
we expect that the aforementioned hardening in short tail lines will continue throughout and impact the insurance and reinsurance markets more broadly due to the incorporation of catastrophe modeling changes in the industry  the impact of greater reinsurance costs on the competitive behavior of insurance companies  wider recognition of increased capital requirements and continued contraction of capacity for catastrophe exposed business  despite new capital entering the industry 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the number and type of contracts we write  as well as prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for our business segments depend upon the underlying line of business 
for the majority of business in our insurance segment  gross premiums are written throughout the year 
an exception to this is the business written in our aviation and aviation war accounts  which is predominantly written in the last quarter of the calendar year  and our property accounts for which two significant renewal dates are april and july for our reinsurance segment  a significant portion of our gross premiums is written in the first quarter of the calendar year  with the remainder primarily split between the second and third quarters 
our premium income is supplemented by the income we generate from our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income investments that are held as available for sale 
under us gaap  these investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the investments are not included in our statement of operations 
rather  these unrealized gains and losses are included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
our investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize investment return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
the volatility of claims and the interest rate environment can affect the returns we generate on our investment portfolio 
our expenses primarily consist of net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
net losses and loss expenses are management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred during a reporting period 
many of our lines of business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity  which may cause volatility in our results of operations from period to period 
also  we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events 
the incidence and occurrence of such catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events across the organization in a variety of ways  including transfer of risk to other reinsurers  a single catastrophic event could affect all of our business segments and the frequency or severity of a catastrophic event could exceed our estimates 
acquisition costs relate to the fees  commissions and taxes paid to obtain business 
we offset commissions received on ceded premiums against acquisition costs 
typically  acquisition costs are based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary by each line of business that we underwrite 
our commissions have included amounts accrued under incentive commission arrangements 
however  we have not entered into any such arrangements with brokers for  or thereafter 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and general operating expenses 
with effect from january   we allocated all of our general and administrative costs  except for corporate expenses  to our underwriting segments 
our corporate costs include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect the full allocation of general and administrative costs as our business segments were not fully operational throughout and we do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate the underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio 
interest expense consists of interest due on outstanding debt  the amortization of debt offering expenses and offering discounts and fees paid in respect of our credit facility 
prior to december   fees paid in respect of our credit facility were included in general and administrative expenses 
consequently  disclosures relating to prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
financial measures our objective as an insurance and reinsurance company is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward us for the risks we assume and to grow revenue only when we deem the returns meet or exceed our requirements 
to achieve this objective  we must be able to accurately assess the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure  to manage our investment portfolio risk appropriately  and to control acquisition costs and infrastructure throughout the organization 
four financial measures that are meaningful in analyzing our performance are return on common equity  book value per common share  combined ratio and underwriting income 
our return on common equity calculation is based on the level of net income available to common shareholders generated from the average of the opening and closing common shareholders equity during the period 
the combined ratio is a formula used by insurance and reinsurance companies to relate net premiums earned during a period to net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses during a period 
book value per common share is calculated by dividing common shareholders equity by the number of outstanding common shares at any period end 
we consider return on common equity and book value per common share appropriate indicators of our returns to common shareholders 
a combined ratio above indicates that a company is incurring more in net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses than it is earning in net premiums 
we consider the combined ratio an appropriate indicator of our underwriting performance  particularly given the relatively short tail orientation of our overall portfolio of risks 
underwriting income on a segment basis is a measure of underwriting profitability that takes into account net premiums earned and other insurance related income as revenue and net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and underwriting related general and administrative expenses as expenses 
underwriting income is the difference between these revenue and expense items 
the following table details our key performance indicators year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands  except share and per share amounts gross premiums written net premiums earned net income available to common shareholders net loss and loss expense ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative expense ratio combined ratio return on average common equity book value per common share because we have a limited operating history and are exposed to volatility in our results of operations  period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
in addition  the amount of premiums written with respect to any particular segment or line of business may vary from year to year as a result of changes in market conditions and our view of the long term profit potential of individual lines of business 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes presented under item included in this report 
acquisition history on february   we completed the acquisition of sheffield insurance corporation for million and subsequently renamed it axis surplus insurance company 
at the time of purchase  sheffield insurance corporation was licensed to write insurance in illinois and alabama and eligible to write surplus lines insurance in states and the district of columbia 
in addition  we added a team of insurance professionals from combined specialty group  inc in the first half of  we acquired the renewal rights to a book of directors and officers liability insurance and related lines business written by the financial insurance solutions fis group of kemper in exchange for an agreement to make an override payment 
the override payment was based on a percentage of gross written premiums of all fis accounts that we renewed 
we purchased this company and agreed to acquire these rights as the foundation for commencing our us insurance operations 
on august   we completed the purchase of fireman s fund insurance company of wisconsin for million and subsequently renamed it axis insurance company axis insurance us 
at the time of purchase  fireman s fund insurance company of wisconsin was licensed in states of the united states and the district of columbia 
the purchase of axis insurance us was made to expand our ability to write insurance on an admitted basis within the us critical accounting policies there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of those policies 
in calculating financial statement estimates  the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss expenses 
for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss expenses  which we also refer to as loss reserves 
our loss reserves are established based upon our estimate of the total cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid  or case reserves  the costs of additional case reserves on claims reported to us but not considered to be adequately reserved  or acr  and the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
for reported losses  we establish case reserves within the parameters of the coverage provided in our insurance or reinsurance contracts 
with respect to our insurance operations  we are notified of insured losses by brokers and insureds and record a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate expected liability arising from the claim 
the estimate reflects the judgment of our claims personnel based on general reserving practices  the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
our reinsurance business is predominantly short to medium tail in nature  which typically allows us to determine the ultimate loss experience within a relatively short period after a contract has expired 
however  the reserving process for our reinsurance operations is more complicated than for our insurance operations 
for reported losses  we generally establish case reserves based on reports received primarily from brokers and also from ceding companies 
with respect to contracts written on an excess of loss basis  we typically are notified of insured losses on specific contracts and record a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate expected liability arising from the claim 
with respect to contracts written on a pro rata basis  we typically receive aggregated claims information and record a case reserve based on this information 
following the occurrence of a reinsured loss  an insured notifies its insurance company which then reports the information to its reinsurer  generally via a broker 
the period of time that elapses between the notification to the insurance company and the reinsurance company varies depending upon a number of factors such as the type of business  whether the reinsurance is written on an excess of loss or proportional basis  the size of the loss  and whether the loss information is provided by brokers or cedants 
typically  the delay can vary from a few weeks to several months 
in addition  as reinsurers  we do not separately evaluate each of the underlying risks assumed and  therefore  we rely upon our cedants underwriting  risk management and claims administration practices 
these factors necessarily create a higher degree of uncertainty in establishing our estimate of loss reserves for our reinsurance operations than for our insurance operations 
in order to reflect this increased level of uncertainty in establishing our loss reserves  some of our underwriting  claims and reserving practices have been modified for our reinsurance business 
in deciding whether to provide treaty reinsurance  we carefully review and analyze the cedant s underwriting and risk management practices to ensure appropriate underwriting  data capture and reporting procedures 
we also utilize an outsourced claims audit program that allows us to review a cedant s claims administration to ensure that its claim reserves are consistent with reinsured exposures  are adequately established and are properly reported in a timely manner  and to verify that claims are being handled appropriately 
for those losses where we receive contract specific loss notifications  our claims department evaluates each notification and may record acrs if claims are not considered to be adequately reserved 
where claims information is received in an aggregated form  our reinsurance contracts typically require that pre defined large losses must be separately notified so that these losses can be adequately evaluated 
as our independent actuaries reserve on a line of business basis  their actuarial methodology allows for reporting time lags when establishing ultimate loss and loss expenses for reinsurance business 
in addition  because we have limited loss experience and insufficient claims development data to calculate credible trends  our independent actuaries use industry data when establishing ultimate loss and loss expenses for our reinsurance business 
loss reserving for catastrophe events in our insurance and reinsurance businesses is an inherently uncertain process 
when a catastrophe occurs  we review our exposures to determine which exposures will be impacted by the event 
we contact brokers and clients to determine their estimate of involvement and the extent to which their programs are affected 
we may also use computer modeling to estimate loss exposures under the actual event scenario 
we currently use risklink version licensed by rms  classic and catrader version licensed by air and worldcat enterprise licensed by eqecat 
as part of the underwriting process  we obtain exposure data from our clients  so that when an event occurs we can run our models to produce an estimate of the losses incurred by clients on programs that we insure or reinsure 
typically  we derive our estimate for the losses from a catastrophic event by blending all of the sources of loss information available to us 
this estimate is derived by the claims team and  where there are no reported case reserves  is known as case ibnr 
for catastrophic events  there generally is considerable uncertainty underlying the assumptions and associated estimated reserves for losses and loss expenses 
reserves are reviewed quarterly and as experience develops and additional information is known  the reserves are adjusted as necessary 
adjustments are reflected in the period in which they become known 
our estimate of our ultimate loss and loss expenses is determined in consultation with ernst young  who acts as our independent reserving actuary  and is based on generally accepted actuarial principles 
the independent actuaries utilize various actuarial methodologies to arrive at a single point estimate for baseline ultimate loss and loss expenses 
the selection of an actuarial methodology and the associated loss ratio is applied at a line of business level to determine the ultimate loss and loss expenses by line of business 
the actuarial method is dependent upon characteristics specific to each line of business  including the extent of company specific loss experience  the maturity of the line of business and the type of coverage 
the actuarial methods utilized include the bornhuetter ferguson method  the initial expected loss ratio method and the chain ladder loss emergence method 
the bornhuetter ferguson method takes as a starting point an assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratio developed by the actuaries and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by the experience to date 
the chain ladder method uses the historical development profile of incurred claims experience to project the more recent  less developed profile of claims experience and to generate ultimate loss and loss expenses 
the initial expected loss ratio method estimates ultimate loss and loss expenses based on pricing information 
due to our limited loss experience  for most lines of business the independent actuaries utilize the bornhuetter ferguson method to derive a single point estimate of baseline ultimate loss and loss expenses 
for our insurance segment  the assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratios developed by the independent actuaries are based on benchmarks derived from the independent actuaries wider market experience together with our limited historical data 
these benchmarks are then adjusted for rating increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed by the market and by us 
for our reinsurance segment  the assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratios are based on contract by contract initial expected loss ratios derived during pricing  together with benchmarks derived from the independent actuaries wider market experience 
under us gaap  we are not permitted to establish loss reserves until an event that gives rise to a loss occurs 
consequently  on some contracts that respond to highly visible  major loss events  we do not establish general ibnr  although in certain cases we are holding case ibnr where potential exposure has been identified 
our independent actuaries apply loss and loss expense ratios to our earned premium to generate estimated baseline ultimate costs of the losses 
from the estimated baseline ultimate costs of losses  we deduct paid losses and reported case reserves to generate our baseline ibnr 
the estimated baseline ultimate costs of losses will almost certainly differ from our actual losses and loss expenses 
the uncertainty surrounding our actual losses and loss expenses is greater for a company like ours that has a limited operating history and claims loss development patterns 
in addition  our limited operating history and claims loss development patterns have necessitated the use of benchmarks in deriving our ibnr 
these benchmarks could differ materially from our actual experience despite management s and the independent actuaries care in selecting them 
to reduce some of this uncertainty  our independent actuaries perform  in conjunction with management  an analysis of additional factors to be considered when establishing our ibnr 
these uncertainties are intended to compensate for our limited operating history and claims loss development patterns  which require the use of industry information that may not be indicative of our actual loss experience 
as at december   we recorded additional ibnr for uncertainties relating to the timing of the emergence of claims 
we anticipate that these uncertainties may vary over time 
a combination of the baseline estimate of ibnr and the reserves for the additional uncertainties produces a single point estimate that constitutes management s and the actuaries best estimate of ibnr 
the following table provides a breakdown of reserves for losses and loss expenses by segment by type of exposure as of december   and as of december  as of december  as of december  in millions property  marine  aviation and aerospace terror  war risk and political risk professional lines and other specialty total global insurance property liability and other specialty professional lines total us insurance catastrophe  property and other professional lines credit and bond  motor and liability total reinsurance total reserves for losses and loss expenses at december   our loss and loss expense reserves of  million included loss and loss expense reserves relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which struck in september and october of these hurricanes produced record industry catastrophe losses and due to the extent of damage  the delay in adjusting losses in affected areas and the interpretation of coverage under insurance contracts  there is considerable uncertainty surrounding our net loss estimates 
if our net loss and loss expense estimate of  million for these events was inaccurate by a factor of  this would equate to a million change in net loss reserves  which change would represent of net income available to common shareholders and of shareholders equity 
in estimating our non hurricane related ultimate loss and loss expenses  our independent actuaries utilize actuarial methodologies that rely on the use of various assumptions 
as of december   the key assumptions used by our actuaries were the establishment of initial expected loss ratios and the establishment of development factors 
both of these assumptions are largely based upon loss information  which may not be indicative of our actual loss experience 
a change in either of these loss assumptions would equate to of our total loss reserves  which change would represent of net income and of shareholders equity 
as of december   a change in these assumptions would equate to in our total loss reserves  which change would represent of net income and of shareholders equity 
the methodology of estimating loss reserves is reviewed each quarter to evaluate whether the assumptions made continue to be appropriate 
any adjustments that result from this review are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified 
our reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflect management s judgment concerning sound financial practice and do not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claims made against us 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
reinsurance recoverable balances 
reinsurance recoverable balances include amounts owed to us in respect of paid and unpaid ceded losses and loss expenses and are presented net of a reserve for non recoverability 
as at december  and  reinsurance recoverable balances were  million and million  respectively 
in establishing our reinsurance recoverable balances  significant judgment is exercised by management in determining the amount of unpaid losses and loss expenses to be ceded as well as our ability to cede losses and loss expenses under our reinsurance contracts 
our ceded unpaid losses and loss expenses consist of two elements  those for reported losses and those for ibnr 
ceded amounts for ibnr are developed as part of our loss reserving process 
consequently  the estimation of ceded unpaid losses and loss expenses is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr see reserve for losses and loss expenses 
as of december  and  ceded ibnr recoverable balances were million and million  respectively 
although our reinsurance recoverable balances are derived from our determination of contractual provisions  the recoverability of such amounts may ultimately differ due to the potential for a reinsurer to become financially impaired or insolvent or for a contractual dispute over contract language or coverage 
consequently  we review our reinsurance recoverable balances on a quarterly basis to determine if there is a need to provide against non recoverability 
in performing this review  we use judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of our reinsurers and the contractual provisions of our reinsurance agreements 
as at december  and  we had a reserve for non recoverability of million and million  respectively 
in the event that the credit worthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our reserve for non recoverability 
premiums 
our revenue is generated primarily by gross premiums written from our underwriting operations 
the basis for the amount of gross premiums recognized varies by the type of contract we write 
for the majority of our insurance business  we receive a flat premium which is identified in the policy and which is recorded as unearned premium on the inception date of the contract 
this premium will adjust only if the underlying insured values adjust 
we actively monitor underlying insured values and record adjustment premiums in the period in which amounts are reasonably determinable 
we also write business on a line slip basis  under which we assume a fixed percentage of the premiums and losses on a particular risk or group of risks along with numerous other unrelated insurers 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises requires that if the ultimate premium is reasonably estimable  the estimated ultimate premium should be recognized as revenue over the period of the contract 
although a premium estimate is not contractually stated for business written on a line slip basis  we believe that the premium is reasonably estimable because we receive an initial estimate of the expected premium written from the client via the broker 
this estimate has been derived by reference to one or more of the following the historical premium volume experienced by the line slip  historical premium volume of similar line slips  and industry information on the underlying business 
we may  if we believe appropriate  adjust the initial estimates provided by the broker to reflect management s best judgments and expectations 
this is most likely where the underwriter believes that the estimate is not prudent 
under these circumstances  we will generally recognize as revenue a lower than advised premium written estimate 
we actively monitor the development of actual reported premium to the estimates made  where actual reported premium deviates from the estimate  we carry out an analysis to determine the cause and may  if necessary  adjust the estimated premium in the period in which the determination was made 
during the years ended december   and  line slip premiums accounted for  and  respectively  of total gross premiums written 
for our reinsurance business  we write contracts on both an excess of loss basis and a proportional basis 
for excess of loss contracts  the amount of premium is usually contractually documented at inception and no management judgment is necessary 
for most such contracts  a deposit premium is generally contractually specified and is payable during the contract period 
after the contract has expired  a premium adjustment is calculated  which is based on the underlying exposure of the ceded business 
we record the deposit premium at the inception of the contract and record adjustments in the periods in which they are reasonably determinable 
for business written under a proportional contract  similar to our line slip business  we are able to reasonably estimate the premium written by reference to an initial estimate of expected ceded premium received from our clients 
in most cases  the treaties are not new and the client can use historical experience to estimate the amount of premium 
we may adjust the initial estimate of premium  and any adjustment is usually a result of the underwriter s prior experience with a client 
we actively monitor the development of actual premium data and  if an adjustment in the premium estimate is warranted  it will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment is determined 
during the years ended december   and  proportional premiums accounted for  and  respectively  of total gross premiums written 
our premiums are earned over the period during which we are exposed to the insured or reinsured risk 
generally  this period equates to the contract period  except for contracts written on a line slip or proportional basis 
for line slip and proportional business  the earning period is generally twice the contract period due to the fact that some of the underlying exposures may attach towards the end of our contracts  and such underlying exposures generally have a one year coverage period 
derivative contracts 
we have underwritten certain contracts that have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under fas  and are therefore recorded at their fair value 
we generally determine fair value using a cash flow model developed by us that is dependent upon several factors  including estimated future default rates  credit spreads  changes in credit quality and future recovery rates 
installment premiums are also considered in the determination of discounted net cash flows 
the change resulting from a movement in the fair value of such contracts is included in the statement of operations in other insurance related income 
during the year ended december   all contracts that had been determined to meet the definition of a derivative expired 
results of operations years ended december  and premiums 
our gross written premiums increased million  which was primarily generated by an increase in gross premiums written of million by our reinsurance segment 
this was largely due to new opportunities within our property book  an increase in reinstatement premiums following incurred losses from hurricane katrina and greater market penetration in continental europe 
the million increase in premium ceded was largely due to an increase in the level of reinsurance purchased by our insurance segment 
this was primarily a result of an increase in premiums written by us insurance 
the million increase in net premiums earned resulted primarily from our reinsurance segment  which reported an increase in net premiums earned of million 
premiums are earned over the term of the policies in proportion to the risks to which they relate 
as the level of net premiums written increases  the level of net premiums earned also increases 
given net premiums written increased for  our net premiums earned also increased 
net investment income 
net investment income increased by million due to a combination of higher investment balances and higher investment yields 
net investment income consisted of million of interest on cash and fixed maturity investments and million of income from other investments  offset by million of net investment expenses 
included in net investment income was million of unrealized gains from other investments 
net investment income for the year ended december  consisted of million of interest on cash and fixed maturity investments and million of income from other investments  offset by million of net investment expenses 
the annualized effective yield calculated by dividing the net investment income generated from invested assets by the average balance of the assets managed by our portfolio managers increased by to 
the increase in the effective yield was primarily due to higher us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve 
the yield may vary significantly from period to period due primarily to the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
net realized losses gains 
net realized losses increased by million 
the increase was generated by a movement in net realized losses of million offset by net realized and unrealized gains of million from investment derivatives that we use to hedge foreign exchange risk in our investment portfolio 
we invest our portfolio to produce a total return 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include investment income  realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses generated by the investment portfolio 
as a result  there can be significant changes in the levels of our net realized gains losses from year to year 
some of our mortgage backed securities are required to be classified as derivatives  and as such  included within net realized losses was million in realized losses from these securities 
the total return for our invested assets for the year ended december  calculated using beginning and ending market portfolio values  adjusted for external cash flows was versus for the year ended december  the total return for an investment portfolio consists of price and income return 
these components are primarily affected by the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
the decrease in total return was due to an increase in intermediate us interest rates that negatively impacted the price of fixed income securities 
for example  the generic year treasury started the year with a yield of and finished the year with a yield of 
this negative price return was  however  offset by a higher income return due to the rising interest rates 
other insurance related income loss 
the decrease of million in other insurance related income loss was primarily due to the movement in the fair value of insurance contracts that meet the definition of derivatives 
during the year ended december   all contracts accounted for as derivatives expired 
net losses and loss expenses 
the increase of million in net losses and loss expenses was primarily generated by an increase in the level of hurricane related net losses and loss expenses 
we incurred net loss and loss expenses of  million in the year ended december  relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma compared to net losses and loss expenses of million in the year ended december  relating to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our loss ratio increased by percentage points in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in late august  hurricane katrina caused widespread damage to homes and businesses in the six us states of louisiana  mississippi  alabama  florida  tennessee and georgia 
the following month hurricane rita struck texas and louisiana causing significant destruction in those areas 
both storms also passed through the oil and gas producing sector of the gulf of mexico causing extensive damage to fixed and mobile structures as well as significant disruption throughout the gulf coast region 
in late october  hurricane wilma made several landfalls  with the most destructive effects felt in the yucat n peninsula of mexico and the us state of florida 
the combination of the three hurricanes resulted in a record level of insured catastrophe losses for a given year  with hurricane katrina the largest insured event in history 
the industry losses estimated by risk management solutions  a risk modeling agency  currently stand at billion to billion for hurricane katrina  billion to billion for hurricane rita and billion to billion for hurricane wilma 
the estimates as to the size of the industry loss vary significantly due primarily to the extent of damage  the delay in adjusting losses in the affected areas and the interpretation of coverage under insurance contracts 
our total net loss and loss expenses for each hurricane within each of our operating segments was as follows year ended december  segment hurricane katrina hurricane rita hurricane wilma total in thousands global insurance us insurance total insurance reinsurance total we have an extensive process for estimating our net loss and loss expenses from these hurricanes that begins before landfall 
we run industry catastrophe models to generate a list of potentially impacted policies and determine an initial loss estimate  which is based on a combination of the output of the models as well as management s experience and knowledge of our business 
in the days and weeks following the event  we gather loss information from a numbers of sources  including our clients  brokers and loss adjustors 
we focus on key accounts that we expect to be exposed to significant insured losses and then promptly follow with a review of all remaining accounts 
during this period  we perform a detailed cross check of the modeled loss estimate with external loss information  and  where appropriate  also review these estimates against market share analyses of industry loss predictions 
after losses are appraised by loss adjustors  we receive more robust and reliable reserve estimates 
eventually  the industry model estimates and non modeled loss information are fully replaced by our own reported claims information 
all loss advices  loss adjuster reports and any letter of credit requests are reviewed by our claims management team for accuracy and adequacy 
over a period of time  our loss and loss expense reserves are then converted into paid settlements 
with respect to hurricanes katrina and rita  the majority of our estimate of loss and loss expenses is represented by actual amounts reported by our clients  brokers and loss adjustors 
for hurricane wilma  our estimate of loss and loss expenses is currently in the early stages of estimation and is based on a blend of industry model outputs  management s experience and actual reported losses 
with respect to hurricane wilma  there has been a delay in substantiating some of our initial estimates because insureds have focused on damages caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
during the year ended december   we incurred estimated net losses and loss expenses of million from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne  which swept across the caribbean and southeastern united states in august and september during the year ended december   we experienced favorable prior period development of million  or percentage points  compared with million  or percentage points  for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to favorable development on prior year loss and loss expense reserves in our global insurance sub segment 
acquisition costs 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was principally the result of a reduction of million in the amounts expensed under our incentive commission arrangements with brokers from  following agreement as to the amounts due under such arrangements 
excluding incentive commissions  the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  increased to compared to for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a change in our business mix with a higher percentage of net earned premiums generated by our reinsurance segment  which has a higher acquisition cost ratio 
for the year ended december   of our net earned premiums was generated by our reinsurance segment compared to for the year ended december  at december   we had two remaining incentive commission arrangements with brokers from that had yet to be resolved 
although we have accrued our best estimate of the amounts due under these arrangements  given the uncertainties that exist surrounding the calculation and payment of these incentive commissions  our estimates are subject to change 
any changes in the estimate are recorded during the period in which the change is identified 
we have not entered into any incentive commission arrangements with brokers for business underwritten in and  therefore  have not accrued any fees regarding these arrangements for the year ended december  the level of commissions charged in by brokers has generally remained consistent with prior periods 
general and administrative expenses 
the million increase in general and administration expenses was generated principally by an increase in compensation costs due primarily to an increase in headcount from the continued expansion of operations in the us the general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in net premiums earned 
foreign exchange 
our functional currency is the us dollar  however  some of our business is written in other currencies 
for the year ended december   we experienced a foreign exchange loss of million  compared to an exchange gain of million for the year ended december  the loss was principally attributable to the decline of the euro against the us dollar and an increase in our asset balances denominated in euros following an increase in the level of gross premiums written in this currency in our reinsurance segment 
interest expense 
the increase of million was primarily due to the issuance of our senior unsecured debt in november  which bears interest at per annum 
interest expense consists of interest due on outstanding debt  the amortization of debt offering expenses and offering discounts  and fees relating to our credit facility 
income tax 
the increase of million in the income tax expense was primarily attributable to the generation of additional taxable income in our us subsidiaries 
preferred dividends 
the increase of million was due to the dividends on our series a preferred shares that we issued in october years ended december  and premiums 
our gross premiums written increased by billion  of this increase  was generated by our reinsurance segment and by our insurance segment 
the increase in gross premiums written in our reinsurance segment was primarily driven by our expansion into continental europe in november  greater market penetration and our ability to participate fully in the first quarter s renewal season 
the increase in gross premiums written in our insurance segment was primarily driven by greater market penetration and new lines of business 
we expect the mix of business within and between our segments to change over time based on market conditions and our view of the long term profit potential of individual lines of business 
premiums ceded increased by million 
the increase was generated by our insurance segment where we purchase reinsurance to reduce our exposure to risk of loss on some lines of business 
net premiums earned increased by billion 
premiums are earned over the term of the policies in proportion to the risks to which they relate 
as the level of net premiums written increases  the level of net premiums earned also increases 
as we experienced an increase in net premiums written in all of our segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   our net premiums earned increased 
net investment income 
net investment income for the year ended december  increased by million due to a combination of higher investment balances and higher investment yields 
net investment income consisted primarily of interest on fixed income securities that was partially offset by net investment expenses of million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the higher expenses were a result of an increase in our assets managed by external portfolio managers offset by securities lending income 
the annualized effective yield calculated by dividing the net investment income generated from invested assets by the average balance of the assets managed by our portfolio managers for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the increase in the effective yield was primarily due to higher us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve 
the yield also was reduced by the additional charge for the amortization expense on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the yield may vary significantly from period to period due primarily to the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
net realized gains 
net realized gains decreased by million 
we invest our portfolios to produce a total return 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include investment income  realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses generated by the investment portfolios 
as a result  there can be significant changes in the levels of our net realized gains losses from quarter to quarter 
some of our mortgage backed securities are required to be classified as derivatives  included within net realized gains was million in realized gains associated with these securities 
the total return for our investment portfolio calculated using beginning and ending market portfolio values  adjusted for external cash flows for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the total return for an investment portfolio consists of price and income return 
these components will primarily be affected by the timing of cash flows  changes in interest rates and changes in asset allocation 
our total return for the year ended december  was similar to the previous year  however  the component returns were different 
in  we obtained a higher income return than in due to an increase in us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve  which resulted in higher portfolio yields 
this increase resulted in a negligible price return in compared to a positive price return in other insurance related income 
the decrease of million related to the movement in the fair value of our insurance and reinsurance contracts that met the definition of a derivative 
net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses increased by million 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in net losses and loss expenses and the net loss and loss expense ratio was primarily driven by an active hurricane season 
we incurred net losses and loss expenses of million from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne  which swept across the caribbean and southeastern united states in august and september our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
as at december   the company had million included within our net ibnr specifically for the hurricane losses 
during the year ended december   we did not experience a major loss as a result of hurricane activity 
the impact of the hurricane related losses was partially mitigated by favorable prior period development of million  or percentage points  compared to million  or percentage points  for the year ended december  acquisition costs 
acquisition costs increased by million  primarily a result of the increase in the volume of gross premiums earned 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the acquisition cost ratio from our insurance segment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  primarily driven by the establishment and expansion of operations in europe and the us in addition  we incurred million of fees in connection with our preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of following the adoption of financial accounting standard no 
 we began to expense stock options and stock awards over the vesting period using the fair value method 
for the year ended december   we expensed million compared to million for the year ended december  the general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the ratio was caused by an increase in the volume of net premiums earned 
foreign exchange 
our functional currency is the us dollar  however  some of our business is written in other currencies 
for the year ended december   we experienced a gain of million compared to a gain of million for the year ended december  while the euro and sterling appreciated by and  respectively  in  these increases were less than the appreciation experienced by these currencies in and  therefore  our gains were less than in interest expense 
the increase of million was due to the issuance of senior unsecured debt in november  which bears interest at a rate of per annum 
interest expense consists of interest due on outstanding debt  the amortization of debt offering expenses and offering discounts and fees relating to our credit facility 
income tax expense 
the increase of million was due to an increase in the level of taxable income generated by our european subsidiaries 
underwriting results by segment our business consists of two underwriting segments insurance and reinsurance 
our insurance segment is further divided into two sub segments global insurance and us insurance 
we evaluate the performance of each underwriting segment based on underwriting results 
we allocate all of our general and administrative costs  except our corporate expenses  to our underwriting segments 
our corporate expenses include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
we do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate the underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio 
insurance our insurance segment provides specialty lines of business on a worldwide basis 
global insurance operates from offices based in bermuda and europe and provides specialty lines coverage predominantly through the london broker network with product lines comprising property  marine  terrorism and war risk  aviation and aerospace  political risk and professional lines and other specialty risks 
us insurance operates through offices throughout the us  provides coverage through a variety of channels in the us  and covers predominantly us exposures 
the product lines are property  professional lines  liability and other specialty and are offered through wholesale brokers  retail brokers and managing general agents and underwriters 
many of our property and casualty insurance products are for nonstandard and complex risks 
us insurance has the ability to write business on an admitted basis using forms and rates as filed with state insurance regulators and on a non admitted  or surplus lines basis  with flexibility in forms and rates not filed with state insurance regulators 
having access to non admitted carriers provides the pricing flexibility needed to write non standard coverage

the decrease in gross premiums written was due to a decrease of million in gross premiums written in global insurance that was partially offset by an increase of million in gross written premiums in us insurance 
the table below shows gross premiums written in global insurance by line of business for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands property marine terrorism and war risk aviation and aerospace political risk professional lines and other specialty total the decrease in gross premiums written in global insurance was primarily due to a significant reduction in the level of aviation and aviation war renewal business written during the fourth quarter of  which is the primary renewal period for this business 
this was due to deterioration in the pricing environment  which resulted in fewer risks meeting our underwriting criteria 
consequently  gross premiums written in our aviation and aerospace line of business decreased by million compared to our aviation and aerospace line of business was also impacted by our decision to reduce our exposure to satellite business  which led to a million decrease in gross premiums written 
our terrorism and war risk line of business decreased by million  of which million was a decrease in aviation war business and of which million was a decrease in terrorism business 
the decrease in terrorism business was primarily due to a deterioration in the pricing environment  which resulted in fewer risks meeting our underwriting criteria  and also due to several contracts written in not being renewed in because of the non recurring nature of events covered by this business 
our global insurance property account experienced a decrease in the level of gross premiums written due primarily to the non renewal of a significant number of contracts where pricing did not meet our underwriting criteria 
the increase in our professional lines and other specialty business was due to the addition of a london market based professional lines underwriting team in early in addition  in mid we secured a new specialty program that generated million of gross premiums written 
the table below shows gross premiums written in us insurance by line of business for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands property professional lines liability other specialty nm total nm not meaningful the increase in gross premiums written in us insurance was driven by growth across all lines of business 
the increase in our us liability account was primarily due to additional umbrella and excess liability gross premiums written of million following our decision to target this class of business and increase the number of dedicated underwriters 
in addition  we wrote million of new specialty program liability business  which primarily covers recreational marine watercraft risk 
these increases were offset by a million decrease on our primary casualty account  principally the result of an increasingly competitive pricing environment 
the increase in our property account was largely driven by an increase of million in premiums generated by our specialty program business and an increase in our inland marine business due to an increase in the number of dedicated underwriters 
the increase in our other specialty account was due to the fact that we began to underwrite this class of business in late  consequently  the year ended december  includes a full year of gross premiums written 
the increase in gross premiums written in our professional lines business was driven primarily by an increase of million in errors and omissions insurance 
this was primarily due to the new appointment of a managing general underwriter effective january  premiums ceded increased by million 
premiums ceded for us insurance increased by million 
the ratio of premiums ceded to gross premiums written in us insurance was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  during the year ended december   however  we increased our net retention on our professional lines book  the impact of which was offset by an increase in the reinsurance ceded on our property book 
this was due to two factors first  an increase in the cost following the renewal of our reinsurance in may  and second  reinstatement premiums due on hurricane losses ceded to reinsurers 
premiums ceded in global insurance increased by million due primarily to reinstatement premiums due on hurricane losses ceded to reinsurers 
the following table shows the derivation of net premiums earned in our insurance segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands gross premiums earned ceded premiums amortized net premiums earned gross premiums are earned over the period of the insured risks  which is generally one to two years 
despite the fall in gross premiums written in  our gross premiums earned increased as we continued to earn premiums written in prior years from risk attaching or multi year policies 
ceded premiums are amortized over the contract term 
ceded premiums amortized for us insurance increased by million to million for the year ended december  due to an increase in gross premiums earned in the year 
the ratio of ceded premiums amortized to gross premiums earned was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  ceded premiums amortized in global insurance increased by million for the year primarily due to a portion of ceded premiums being fully amortized following the exhaustion of reinsurance protection on some contracts following hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
other insurance related loss income 
other insurance related loss primarily related to the movement in the fair value of our insurance contracts that meet the definition of derivatives 
these contracts typically insure a portfolio of sovereign debt securities against the risk of default 
during the year ended december   all contracts accounted for as derivatives expired 
net losses and loss expenses 
the increase in the loss and loss expense ratio was primarily due to an increase in the level of hurricane related net incurred loss and loss expenses 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for global insurance was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due to the impact of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma from which we incurred estimated net loss and loss expenses of million  or percentage points 
during the year ended december   we incurred estimated net loss and loss expenses of million  or percentage points  in respect of hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
the losses from hurricanes katrina and rita were primarily generated from our onshore property and offshore energy business within our property and marine books of business following property damage and business interruption claims 
our gross loss and loss expenses estimates were million and million for hurricanes katrina and rita  respectively  and were primarily based on loss information received from our clients  brokers and loss adjustors 
our losses with respect to hurricane wilma were primarily derived from our property book 
our gross loss and loss expenses estimate of million was primarily derived from a review of our in force contracts and preliminary loss information from our clients  brokers and loss adjustors in combination with the output of industry models 
actual losses from these hurricanes may differ materially from our estimates of loss and loss expenses 
our gross loss and loss expenses estimates were reduced by reinsurance recoveries  primarily from excess of loss reinsurance contracts  by million on hurricane katrina  million on hurricane rita and million on hurricane wilma 
during the year ended december   we experienced favorable development in prior year loss and loss expense reserves of million  or percentage points  compared to million  or percentage points  for the year ended december  in estimating the ultimate cost of losses  we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method 
this method takes as a starting point an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by our experience to date 
given our limited operating history  our initial expected loss and loss expense ratios have primarily been based on industry data  however  in  as loss experience continued to emerge from prior years  we began to utilize our own specific loss information in establishing initial net loss and loss expense ratios on short tail lines of business 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for us insurance was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due to the impact of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma from which we incurred net loss and loss expenses of million  or percentage points 
during the year ended december   we incurred net loss and loss expenses of million  or percentage points  in respect of hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
the losses from these hurricanes were generated from our property book of business 
our estimates of gross loss and loss expenses were million  million and million for hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  respectively 
our estimate of our gross loss and losses expenses on hurricanes katrina and rita were primarily based upon loss information received from our clients  brokers and loss adjustors 
our estimate on hurricane wilma was based upon a combination of the output of industry models  a review of our in force contracts and preliminary loss information from our clients  brokers and loss adjustors 
actual losses from these hurricanes may differ materially from our estimates of loss and loss expenses 
us insurance purchases significant reinsurance protection on a per risk and excess of loss basis  which reduced our gross losses by million in respect of hurricane katrina  million in respect of hurricane rita and million in respect of hurricane wilma 
during the year ended december   we experienced favorable prior year development on our property business of million  or percentage points  compared to million  or percentage points  during the year ended december  acquisition costs 
the decrease in the acquisition cost ratio was driven by a decrease in the acquisition cost ratio of global insurance 
acquisition costs in global insurance were million  or of net premiums earned  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of net premiums earned  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction of million in amounts expensed under incentive commission arrangements with brokers for and an increase in ceded amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing an additional million of ceded premium following the hurricanes 
excluding these factors  the acquisition cost ratio remained consistent at for the year ended december  compared to in the prior year 
us insurance acquisition costs were million  or of net premiums earned  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of net premiums earned  for the year ended december  the ratio was impacted by a reduction of million in the amounts expensed under incentive commission arrangements with brokers for excluding the incentive commissions  the acquisition cost ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a change of business mix with a higher percentage of premiums derived from our specialty program business  which has a higher level of acquisition costs 
we expect acquisition costs to increase as our specialty program business continues to grow 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses ratio was consistent with the prior year 
years ended december  and december  the following table summarizes the underwriting results and ratios for the insurance segment for the years ended december  and december  years ended december  december  change change in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned other insurance related income expenses net losses and loss expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income ratios net loss and loss expense ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative expense ratio combined ratio for the year ended december   we did not allocate any of our general and administrative expenses  except for the personnel expenses of our underwriters  therefore  the general and administrative amounts  expense ratios and combined ratios for the two periods are not comparable 
premiums 
the table below shows gross premiums written in global insurance by line of business for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands property marine terrorism and war risk aviation and aerospace political risk professional lines and other specialty nm total the increase in gross premiums written in global insurance was primarily generated by three lines of business professional lines and other specialty  political risk and terrorism and war risk 
the increase in our professional lines and other specialty book was due to an increase of million in directors and officers liability premium following our entry into this line of business in the second half of the increase in our political risk gross written premiums was due to an increase in the level of direct foreign investment and a strategic initiative targeting this business 
we experienced an increase in our terrorism and war risk line primarily due to an increase in our aviation war account following an increase in our renewal premium participation and also new business written 
property gross premiums written in global insurance increased by million  due primarily to the restructuring of existing participations on renewed business and some new business  which offset the effects of rate reductions 
our marine book experienced a decrease in gross premiums written of million primarily due to a reduction of million in our energy offshore business due to a combination of shifting renewal dates  rate reductions and our decision not to renew some business 
we also experienced an million reduction on our marine liability business primarily due to our decision not to renew some contracts 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase of million in our marine cargo line following the recruitment of a cargo specie underwriting team that began to underwrite premiums in the second quarter of gross premiums written on our aviation book remained constant despite our decision not to renew some major accounts  although rates declined in this book of business  gross premiums written remained at a consistent level due to an increase in the level of insured exposures 
the table below shows gross premiums written in us insurance by line of business for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands property liability professional lines other specialty total the increase in gross premium written in us insurance was primarily driven by our property and liability books of business following an increase in the level of underwriting staff and increased marketing efforts 
the increase in our us insurance property book was primarily due to three reasons first  we introduced a new product line in mid  second  we increased our maximum line sizes  which enabled our underwriters to access more business  and third  we increased the number of states in which we were able to write business on a non admitted basis 
the increase in our liability book was primarily driven by an increase in our maximum line size for our umbrella and excess coverages  which enabled our underwriters to access more business  and therefore increased market penetration 
the increase in our professional lines was primarily driven by the fact that we did not acquire the renewal rights of a book of directors and officers liability insurance and related lines of business written by the fis group of kemper until february  included within the gross premiums written for the year ended december  was million relating to the cancel rewrite process that followed the acquisition of the renewal rights 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  included million of gross premiums written on a new line of business errors and omissions insurance for professional institutions 
these premiums partially offset the effect of a reduction in rates for our directors and officers liability insurance  which caused us to decline to renew some contracts where rates did not meet our targeted levels 
the increase in our premiums ceded was primarily due to an increase in the level of reinsurance purchased in order to mitigate volatility in losses as our portfolio grows 
in us insurance  the ratio of premiums ceded to gross premiums written decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this reduction was principally driven by our decision to maintain a higher net retention on our professional lines book of business 
in addition  included in written premiums ceded for the year ended december  was million related to reinstatement premiums on coverages exhausted by losses  primarily emanating from hurricanes frances and ivan

consequently  the level of gross premiums earned increased as the level of gross premiums written increased 
ceded premiums are amortized over the contract term 
consequently  the level of amortized ceded premium increased in as premiums ceded in continued to be amortized in other insurance related income 
other insurance related income decreased by million due to the movement in the fair value of our insurance contracts that met the definition of a derivative 
net losses and loss expenses 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december   an increase of percentage points 
the increase in net loss and loss expenses and the net loss and loss expense ratio was primarily due to an increase in the level of net loss and loss expenses due to significant hurricane activity 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for global insurance was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we experienced significant net losses and loss expenses of million  or percentage points  from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne in our property  energy and marine books of business 
these losses primarily accounted for the increase in the level of reported case reserves 
our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
the increase in our reinsurance recoveries was primarily driven by recoveries of million from losses caused by hurricanes frances and ivan 
during the year ended december   we experienced favorable development on our prior accident years of million compared to million during the year ended december  this reduced the net loss ratio by percentage points for the year ended december  and percentage points for the year ended december  we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method to estimate the ultimate cost of losses  it takes as a starting point an assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by the experience to date 
if actual claims are less than expected  this generates favorable loss development 
during the year ended december   the favorable development was generated primarily on our accident year and was derived from our energy  property  terrorism and aviation war lines of business 
for the year ended december   the favorable development was generated on our accident year and was derived from our marine  aviation war  energy and property lines of business 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for us insurance was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne from which we incurred net losses and loss expenses of million  or percentage points 
our hurricane losses benefited from reinsurance recoveries of million 
our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
during the year ended december   we experienced positive prior period development of million or percentage points on our accident year property account 
we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method to estimate the ultimate cost of losses  it takes as a starting point an assumed loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by our experience to date 
during the year ended december   actual claims were less than expected for our accident year property account resulting in favorable loss development 
acquisition costs 
the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was driven by an increase in the acquisition cost ratios of both global and us insurance 
acquisition costs for global insurance for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  the increase in the acquisition cost ratio was partially caused by higher amortized reinsurance costs  which reduced the level of net premiums earned 
as a percentage of gross premiums earned  the level of acquisition costs was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase of percentage points in the level of the gross acquisition ratio was primarily due to additional commissions 
acquisition costs for us insurance for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  as a percentage of gross premiums earned  the acquisition cost ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was primarily driven by a reduction in the level of commissions received on ceded premiums  which are offset against acquisition costs 
excluding the impact of commissions received on ceded premiums  the acquisition cost ratio as a percentage of gross premiums earned was consistent at for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
the percentage point increase in our general and administrative expenses ratio for the year ended december  was due to an increase in us insurance business  which has a higher general and administrative expense ratio than global insurance 
reinsurance our reinsurance segment operates through offices based in bermuda  the us and europe and provides treaty property and casualty reinsurance to insurance companies on a worldwide basis 
treaty reinsurance contracts are contractual arrangements that provide for automatic reinsurance of any agreed upon portion of business written as specified in a reinsurance contract 
contracts can be written on an excess of loss basis or a pro rata basis  also known as proportional 
the product lines in this segment are catastrophe  property  professional liability  credit and bond  motor  liability and other

the table below shows gross premiums written by line of business in our reinsurance segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands catastrophe property professional lines credit and bond motor liability other total we experienced a significant increase in gross written premiums in our property account due to several factors 
first  our gross premiums written grew by million as a result of greater market penetration in continental europe following our expansion into this marketplace in second  excluding continental european business  we experienced an increase in the level of pro rata gross premiums written of million resulting from a combination of new business  an increase in renewal premiums and also adjustments on prior year premium estimates 
third  excluding continental european business  our property per risk gross premiums written increased due to an additional million of reinstatement premiums and our ability to increase our share on selected renewal business 
the increase in our catastrophe account was primarily due to the impact of the hurricanes 
we recorded million in reinstatement premiums on the hurricanes  compared to million on the hurricanes 
in addition  million of gross premiums written were from additional reinsurance protection written for clients following the exhaustion of their reinsurance coverage as a result of hurricane katrina 
although we experienced rate decreases in our catastrophe book during  we wrote some new business and our renewal business was focused primarily on us exposures where rate reductions were less severe than those for non us business 
in addition  we experienced rate increases on some national accounts impacted by hurricane losses in we believe that catastrophe rates will increase in  particularly on us related exposures impacted by hurricane losses in the increase in our liability account was primarily driven by new market opportunities in us general liability umbrella excess reinsurance business and our acquiring approved reinsurer status with some us clients that allowed us to write new business 
in  we began to write motor and credit and bond reinsurance business and has seen continued growth within these lines of business due to our ability to access new markets and increase our share on renewal business 
we experienced an increase in our professional lines book during the year with a significant shift in our business from directors and officers liability insurance to miscellaneous errors and omissions insurance 
premiums ceded for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
within our reinsurance segment we primarily purchase reinsurance as and when market opportunities arise to mitigate the impact from catastrophe loss events 
consequently  the level of premiums ceded can fluctuate period to period 
the decrease was primarily due to changes in the timing of the renewal of ceded reinsurance contracts 
following the losses generated by the hurricanes in september  we exhausted some of our reinsurance coverage and purchased new protections

ceded premiums are amortized over the contract term 
consequently  the level of ceded premiums amortized increased in as premiums ceded in continued to be amortized in net losses and loss expenses 
the increase in the net loss and loss expenses ratio was primarily driven by the impact of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma for which we incurred estimated net losses of million  or percentage points 
during the year ended december   we incurred estimated net losses of million  or percentage points  from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our losses were primarily generated from our catastrophe and property lines of business as we write negligible amounts of offshore energy reinsurance 
our estimates for the losses incurred from hurricanes katrina and rita were derived from a review of in force contracts and loss information from clients and brokers in combination with the output of industry models 
our estimate for hurricane wilma was derived from the output of industry models  market share analyses  a review of in force contracts and preliminary loss information from our clients and brokers 
actual losses from these hurricanes may differ materially from our estimates of loss and loss expenses 
our estimated gross losses were reduced by million of reinsurance recoveries that were triggered by the occurrence of a series of large industry loss events 
this reinsurance has predetermined industry loss triggers based on the size and number of industry losses calculated by independent third parties 
based on a combination of public information  our own assessment of each industry loss and historical industry development factors  we believe that these industry loss trigger points have been exceeded  however  these industry loss figures are only estimates and as such are subject to change 
consequently  actual reinsurance recoveries could be materially reduced 
during the year ended december   we experienced favorable prior period development of million  or percentage points  compared to million  or percentage points  for the year ended december  in estimating the ultimate cost of losses  we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method 
this method takes as a starting point an initial expected loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by our experience to date 
any change in the loss experience that causes us to change our loss ratio is reflected during the quarter in which the loss emergence is experienced 
during the year ended december   our loss experience on prior accident years was better than expected  primarily on our property catastrophe business in accident years and acquisition costs 
the decrease in the acquisition cost ratio was primarily due to a reduction of million in the amounts expensed under incentive commission arrangements with brokers for excluding incentive commissions  the acquisition cost ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a change in business mix with more business coming from product lines other than catastrophe excess of loss  which typically have higher acquisition costs

premiums 
the table below shows gross premiums written by line of business in our reinsurance segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  december  change change in thousands catastrophe property professional lines credit and bond motor liability other total our gross premiums written increased primarily due to our expansion into continental europe and an increase in property and catastrophe business 
the increase in our property gross premiums written was primarily due to an increase in the number of contracts written 
the increase in our catastrophe book of business was driven by a trend toward counterparty diversification in our target markets  which enabled us to participate on a greater number of programs than in the prior year  this offset some moderate rate reductions and instances where we declined to renew contracts because terms and conditions became unacceptable 
credit and bond was a new line of business in following the opening of a reinsurance branch in zurich 
the increases in our professional lines book and our liability book were primarily generated by our ability to quote and write contracts that came up for renewal on january  in  we were unable to take part in the january  renewal season because we did not receive regulatory approvals until mid december in addition  we increased the statutory capital of axis re us at the end of the first quarter of to in excess of million  which enabled us to participate in more business 
the increase in our motor line of business was due to our expansion into continental europe during the year 
premiums ceded increased by million due partly to million of reinstatement premiums on coverages exhausted by losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our global reinsurance segment purchases reinsurance to protect against a large industry loss or series of losses 
the following table shows the derivation of net premiums earned for the years ended december  and december  years ended december  december  change change in thousands gross premiums earned ceded premiums amortized net premiums earned gross premiums are earned over the period of the reinsured risk 
consequently  the level of gross premiums earned increased as the level of gross premiums written increased 
we expect the level of gross premiums earned to continue to increase in ceded premiums are amortized over the contract term 
consequently  the level of amortized ceded premium increased in as premiums ceded in continued to be amortized in other insurance related income 
other insurance related income related to the movement in the fair value of a reinsurance contract that met the definition of a derivative 
net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses increased by million due primarily to additional net premiums earned and net losses and loss expenses related to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
the net loss and loss expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due to losses from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne from which we incurred net losses and loss expenses of million  or percentage points 
our hurricane losses benefited from reinsurance recoveries of million 
our estimates for the losses incurred from these hurricanes were derived from formal loss advices  the output of industry models  a review of in force contracts and preliminary indications from clients 
consequently  actual losses from these hurricanes may vary materially from estimated losses 
our gross losses were reduced by reinsurance recoveries that were triggered by the occurrence of a series of large industry loss events 
recoveries under our reinsurance are dependent on industry losses  which are calculated by independent third parties  exceeding predetermined trigger points 
during the year ended december   our loss experience benefited from the lack of major catastrophes 
our reinsurance segment has loss experience categorized as low frequency but high severity in nature and  therefore  our loss experience can be volatile 
during the year ended december   we experienced favorable development on our prior accident years of million compared to million during the year ended december  this reduced the net loss ratio by percentage points for the year ended december   and percentage points for the year ended december  we primarily use the bornhuetter ferguson method to estimate the ultimate cost of losses  it takes as a starting point an assumed ultimate loss and loss expense ratio and blends in the loss and loss expense ratio implied by the experience to date 
if actual claims are less than expected  this generates favorable loss development 
during the year ended december   the favorable development was generated primarily on our accident year and was derived primarily from our property catastrophe line of business 
for the year ended december   the favorable development was generated on our accident year and was derived primarily from our property catastrophe line of business 
acquisition costs 
acquisition costs increased due to an increase in the level of net premiums earned 
the acquisition cost ratio decreased primarily due to a reduction in the level of commissions incurred 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million 
as we did not allocate any of our general and administrative expenses  except for the personnel expenses of our underwriters  prior to january   these amounts and ratios are not comparable 
financial condition and liquidity we are a holding company and have no substantial operations of our own 
our assets consist primarily of our investments in subsidiaries 
at december   we had operating subsidiaries in bermuda  ireland and the united states  a branch in the united kingdom  a branch in switzerland and a representative office in singapore 
accordingly  our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries 
the ability to pay dividends or distributions is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of bermuda  ireland and the united states  which subject our insurance subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  some of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends that these subsidiaries can pay to us  which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends on our common shares and make other payments 
under the bermuda companies act  as amended  axis capital may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus only if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
at december   the maximum amount of distributions that our subsidiaries could pay to axis capital under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval was approximately billion 
financial condition at december   our shareholders equity was billion compared to billion at december  the increase of billion was primarily due to net income of million for the year  the issuance of series a and b preferred shares of million and the issuance of million of common shares and was offset by a common share repurchase of million pursuant to a share repurchase program that has been exhausted 
investments at december   our total investments at fair market value  accrued interest receivable and cash net of unsettled investment trades were billion compared to billion at december  our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities at december  and was managed by several external investment management firms 
at december   all of these fixed income securities were investment grade  with rated aa or aa or better by an internationally recognized rating agency 
the weighted average rating of our fixed income portfolio was aaa based on ratings assigned by standard poor s 
during  we continued to increase the size of the allocation to other investments within our investment portfolio 
at december   other investments were million compared to million at december  and consisted of investments in funds of funds  a fund that invests in us dollar high yield credit  funds that primarily invest in senior secured bank loans and a portfolio of investments in collateralized loan obligations 
we regularly review our investment portfolio for other than temporary impairments and determined at december  that no impairment exists 
for additional information regarding the investment portfolio and an analysis of sector  rating and maturity distributions  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
reserve for loss and loss expenses at december   we had billion of reserves for loss and loss expenses compared to billion at december   an increase of billion 
the increase was primarily due to loss and loss expense reserves relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
of this balance  billion  or  was incurred but not reported reserves  compared to billion  or  at december  the percentage of ibnr reserves to total loss reserves was lower at december  and reflects the significant case reserves established for hurricane katrina  rita and wilma during the year 
for a number of the policies exposed to these hurricane losses  coverage limits have been exhausted and  therefore  the potential for adverse loss development is limited 
consequently  no additional general ibnr reserves have been established 
for further discussion and analysis on our reserve for loss and loss expenses refer to note in our consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
reinsurance recoverable balances following hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  we recorded significant reinsurance recoveries that generated an increase of million in reinsurance recoverable balances 
of the reinsurance recoverable balances  was due from reinsurers rated the equivalent of a or better by internationally recognized rating agencies 
of the remaining reinsurance recoverable balances  were fully collateralized 
for further discussion and analysis on reinsurance recoverable balances refer to note in our consolidated financial statements in item in this report 
liquidity our cash flows from operations generally represent the difference between premiums collected  reinsurance recoveries and investment earnings realized  and losses and loss expenses paid  reinsurance purchased and underwriting and other expenses paid 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially  however  from net income 
the potential for a large claim under one of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time 
during the year ended december   we generated a net operating cash inflow of billion  primarily related to premiums received and investment income 
during the same period  we paid gross losses of million and received reinsurance recoveries of million 
at december   we had a cash balance of  million 
during the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by financing activities 
this was primarily due to the issuance of million of common and preferred shares offset by the repurchase of  common shares owned by initial investors at the formation of the company 
the average purchase price was per common share and the aggregate purchase price was million 
during the same period  we paid dividends to common shareholders of million and interest on our senior notes of million 
during the year ended december   we generated a net operating cash inflow of billion  primarily relating to premiums received and investment income 
during the same period  we paid gross losses of million and received reinsurance recoveries of million 
we invested a net cash amount of  million during the period  and at december  had a cash balance of million 
during the year ended december   net cash of million was generated from financing activities 
we paid dividends to common shareholders of million and raised million from a senior note offering 
during  we declared four quarterly dividends of per common share 
the dividends were paid on april   july   october  and january  during  we declared four quarterly dividends of per common share 
the dividends were paid on april   july   october  and january  on an ongoing basis  our sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written  reinsurance recoveries  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
cash is used primarily to pay losses and loss expenses  reinsurance premiums  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses  to purchase new investments and to fund dividend and interest payments 
many of our lines of business have loss experience characterized as low frequency and high severity  which may cause volatility in our results of operations and our operating cash flows 
capital resources in addition to common equity  we depend upon other external sources of finance such as debt  preference shares  letters of credit and other credit facilities to support our operating activities 
having sufficient capital allows us to take advantage of profitable opportunities that may arise in our operating segments 
we are also required to maintain adequate capital resources to comply with various statutory regulations in bermuda  ireland and the us a strong capital base is also important for maintaining the financial strength ratings of our operating subsidiaries  which is essential in establishing our competitive position 
on november   we completed a public offering of million of senior notes 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually and  unless previously redeemed  will mature on december  we may redeem the senior notes at any time and from time to time  in whole or in part  at a make whole redemption price  however  we have no current intentions of calling the senior notes 
the indenture governing the senior notes contain various covenants  including limitations on liens on the stock of restricted subsidiaries  restriction as to the disposition of the stock of restricted subsidiaries and limitations on mergers and consolidations 
we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the indenture at december  for the future expected payments on the senior notes  refer to note a in our consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
on october   we issued million of series a preferred shares  par value per share  with a liquidation preference of per share 
we may redeem the shares on and after october  at a redemption price of per share 
dividends on the series a preferred shares are non cumulative 
consequently  if our board of directors does not authorize and declare a dividend for any dividend period  holders of the series a preferred shares will not be entitled to receive a dividend for such period  and such undeclared dividend will not accumulate and be payable 
holders of series a preferred shares will be entitled to receive  only when  as and if declared by our board of directors  non cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date  quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of january  april  july and october of each year  commencing on january   without accumulation of any undeclared dividends 
to the extent declared  these dividends will accumulate  with respect to each dividend period  in an amount per share equal to of the liquidation preference per annum 
on november   we issued million of series b preferred shares with a liquidation preference of per share 
we may redeem the shares on or after december  at a redemption price of per share 
dividends on the series b preferred shares if  as and when declared by our board of directors will be payable initially at a fixed rate per annum equal to of the liquidation preference on the first day of march  june  september and december of each year  commencing on march   up to but not including december  commencing on march   the dividend rate on the series b preferred shares will be payable at a floating rate 
during a floating rate period  the floating rate per annum will be reset quarterly at a rate equal to plus the month libor rate 
dividends on the series b preferred shares are non cumulative 
consequently  if our board of directors does not declare a dividend for any dividend period  holders of the series b preferred shares will not be entitled to receive a dividend for such period  and such undeclared dividend will not accumulate and will not be payable 
on august   we entered into a billion credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders replacing our existing million credit facility 
the credit agreement is an unsecured five year facility that allows us and our operating subsidiaries to issue letters of credit up to the full amount of the facility and to borrow up to million for general corporate purposes  with total usage not to exceed billion 
the credit agreement contains various loan covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of future indebtedness  future liens  fundamental changes  investments and certain transactions with affiliates 
the facility also requires that we maintain a minimum consolidated net worth of billion plus a of consolidated net income if positive of axis capital for each semi annual fiscal period ending on or after december  plus b an amount equal to of the net cash proceeds received by axis capital from the issuance of its capital stock during each such semi annual fiscal period  and a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreement at december  as at december   we had letters of credit of million million outstanding 
there was no debt outstanding under the credit agreements as at december  or on october   we filed an unallocated universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that was declared effective on october  under the shelf registration statement  we may issue up to billion of equity  debt  trust preferred securities or a combination of these securities 
on november   we completed a common share offering of  shares at raising aggregate net proceeds of million under this shelf registration statement 
in addition  the million of series b preferred shares were issued under this shelf registration statement 
commitments we did not make any significant capital expenditures during the year ended december  we currently expect capital expenditures for to be less than million 
the following table provides an analysis of our contractual obligations at december  payment due by period expressed in thousands of us dollars total less than year years years more than years reserve for losses and loss expenses senior notes including interest payments operating lease obligations please refer to capital resources above for details regarding the payment of preferred dividends 
loss reserves represent estimates  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of an insurer s or reinsurer s expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
as a result  it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from such estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in loss severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation  litigation and tort reform 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which our company has operated  thereby providing limited claims loss emergence patterns specifically for our company 
this has necessitated the use of industry loss development patterns in deriving ibnr  which despite management s and the independent actuary s care in selecting them will differ from actual experience 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability will exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
similarly  we have limited loss payout pattern information specific to our experience  therefore we have used industry data  on a line by line basis  to estimate our expected payments 
consequently  despite management s and our independent actuary s care in selecting them  the actual payment of our reserve for losses and loss expenses will differ from estimated payouts 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to potential loss on our investment portfolio from various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  and from credit risk 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of fixed income securities denominated in both us and foreign currencies 
external investment professionals manage our portfolio under the direction of our management in accordance with investment guidelines provided by us 
our guidelines do not currently permit the use of derivatives other than foreign currency forward contracts 
in the future  we may change our guidelines to permit the use of derivatives 
interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of fixed income securities included in our investment portfolio 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
our current duration target for our investments is two to four years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security and also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early principal payment of such security 
we seek to utilize investment benchmarks that reflect this duration target 
we periodically revise our investment benchmarks based on business and economic conditions  including the average duration of our potential liabilities 
at december   our invested assets assets under management by external investment managers had an approximate duration of years 
at december   we held  million at fair market value  or of our total invested assets  in mortgage backed securities compared to  million  or  at december  when interest rates decline  these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of underlying mortgages increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
when interest rates increase  these assets are exposed to extension risk  which occurs when holders of underlying mortgages reduce the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and delay any refinancing of the outstanding principal 
we have calculated the effect that an immediate parallel shift in the us interest rate yield curve would have on our assets under management by third party investment managers at december  the modeling of this effect was performed on each security individually using the security s effective duration and changes in prepayment expectations for mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the results of this analysis are summarized in the table below 
interest rate movement analysis on market value of assets under management by external investment managers interest rate shift in basis points expressed in thousands of us dollars total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value foreign currency risk 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of fixed income securities included in our investment portfolio that are denominated in those currencies 
therefore  we attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
in addition  we have implemented a currency hedging program whereby we entered into several foreign currency forward contracts in order to minimize the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
a foreign currency forward contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency forward contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
however  we do not expect to enter into such contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets 
foreign currency forward contracts purchased are not specifically identifiable against cash  any single security or any groups of securities and  therefore  do not qualify and are not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
all realized gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in our statements of operations 
at december   the net contractual amount of foreign currency forward contracts was million with an unrealized gain of million 
at december   the net contractual amount of foreign currency forward contracts was million with an unrealized loss of million 
at december   we had insurance and reinsurance premium balances receivable of  million compared to million at december  of this balance  was denominated in us dollars  was denominated in euro and in sterling 
a increase or decrease in the value of the euro and sterling currencies against the us dollar would produce a gain or loss of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure by purchasing fixed income investments rated bbb baa or higher 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single corporate issuer to or less of our portfolio for securities rated a a or above and or less of our portfolio for securities rated between bbb baa and bbb baa at december   we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than of our portfolio  other than with respect to us government and agency securities 
in addition  we have credit risk under some contracts where we receive premiums in return for assuming the risk of default on pre determined portfolios of sovereign and corporate obligations 
value at risk 
our management uses value at risk var as one of its tools to measure potential losses in fair market values of our investment portfolio 
the var calculation is calculated by a third party provider and reviewed by management 
var uses a monte carlo simulation to project many different prices of fixed income securities  derivatives and currencies taking into account  among other things  the volatility and the correlation between security price changes over various forecast horizons 
the var of our investment portfolio at december  was approximately million compared to million at december   which represents the potential loss in fair market value of our investment portfolio over a one year time horizon within a confidence level 
this increase was primarily due to a slight extension of the portfolio duration and an increase in the size of the investment portfolio 
the var computation is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair market value 
we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the anticipated effects on us are considered in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled
