item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting our expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our expectations will be realized 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a real estate investment trust reit that has been in the business of owning and developing shopping centers and other commercial real estate since we attempt to deliver superior rates of return to shareholders by actively developing  acquiring and intensively managing properties in states that span the southern portion of the united states from coast to coast 
our portfolio of properties includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties aggregating over million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during we focus on increasing funds from operations and increasing dividend payments to our common shareholders 
we do this through hands on leasing  management and selected redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments  and through the disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we do this while remaining committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed  income producing properties and seven properties that are in various stages of development 
our properties include shopping centers and industrial properties 
we have approximately  leases and  different tenants 
leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
we believe stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 

table of contents in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio was at december  compared to at december  another important indicator of performance is the spread in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals in totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a same space basis 
with respect to external growth through acquisitions and new developments  management closely monitors movements in returns in relation to our blended weighted average cost of capital  the amount of product in the acquisition and new development pipelines and the geographic areas in which opportunities are present 
we acquired shopping centers  a building adjacent to one of our houston shopping centers and seven industrial properties in comprising million square feet  and representing a total investment of million  which included investments made through joint ventures or partnerships 
our purchases include seven in north carolina  four in texas  three in florida  two each in georgia and tennessee  and one in california  nevada  colorado and kentucky 
with respect to new development  we completed three retail projects during totaling  square feet  representing an investment of million 
as of december   we had nine retail projects and one apartment complex in various stages of development 
these projects  upon completion  will represent an investment of million and add million square feet to the portfolio 
anchored by market dominant supermarkets or national discount department stores  these properties are slated to open during and into continuing our strategy of selling assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria  we sold properties in these dispositions included shopping centers  three industrial properties and a vacant building 
in addition  we sold an interest in two shopping centers located in louisiana 
these property sales represented a total of million square feet and provided proceeds of million  generating a gain of million 
we continue to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed 
with respect to future trends  management expects continued improvement in the performance of the existing portfolio through further increases in occupancy and increases in rental rates as the economy moves forward 
any deterioration in the economy could alter these expectations 
we are also committed to an accelerated disposition plan for non core properties 
we will be disposing of properties in smaller markets where we have a minimal investment or markets with slower growth rates  which are often the markets that have low barriers to entry 
we plan to sell million to million of non core assets in  which will allow us to recycle capital and lessen our need to raise new equity 
also  we anticipate selling or contributing an additional million to million of properties to new joint ventures 
through the use of joint ventures we expect to earn more fee revenue from managing properties 
also  we are expanding our new development program  which will include a merchant developer component where we will build  lease and then sell the developed real estate 
subsequent to year end  two retail properties were sold  which represented a total of 
million square feet and provided proceeds of million 
also  we have purchased an industrial property totaling million in the first quarter of and have over million of properties in the acquisition pipeline 
these potential acquisitions are still subject to a stringent due diligence process and  therefore  there is no assurance that any or all will be purchased 
changes in interest and capitalization rates inherent in the pricing of acquisitions could affect our external growth prospects for 
table of contents summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
among the more significant ones are the depreciable lives of our assets  the allocation of purchase price on acquisitions  the recoverability of our receivables  our consolidation policy and our impairment review of property 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our subsidiaries and certain partially owned joint ventures or partnerships  which meet the guidelines for consolidation 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts on our consolidated financial statements 
partially owned joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned joint ventures or partnerships  we first apply the guidelines set forth in fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
based upon our analysis  we have determined that we have no variable interest entities 
partially owned joint ventures or partnerships over which we exercise financial and operating control are consolidated in our financial statements 
in determining if we exercise financial and operating control  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
partially owned joint ventures and partnerships where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but do not exercise financial and operating control are accounted for using the equity method 
revenue recognition rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  which begins the earlier of the date the leasehold improvements are substantially complete  if owned by us  or the date the tenant takes control of the space  if the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is recognized in the period the related expense is recorded 
revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
accrued rent and accounts receivable receivable balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 

table of contents property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  which  in the opinion of management  is not in excess of the individual property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from disposition 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the purchase method as set forth in sfas no 
and sfas no 
and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
we have used estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques to allocate the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  and other identifiable intangibles 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties 
these costs include preacquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are clearly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
property includes costs for tenant improvements paid by us  including reimbursements to tenants for improvements that will remain our property after the lease expires 
our properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
such carrying amount is adjusted  if necessary  to estimated fair value to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenues total revenues increased by million or in million in versus million in

table of contents effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are payment of our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  payment of debt service costs  and funding planned growth 
we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all common and preferred dividend payments and debt service costs  as well as the capital necessary to maintain and operate our existing properties 
our primary sources of capital for funding acquisitions and new development are our million revolving credit facility and cash generated from dispositions of properties that no longer meet our investment criteria and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term unsecured debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from dispositions of properties  and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december  and february   the balance outstanding on our million revolving credit facility was million and million  respectively  and million and million  respectively  was outstanding under the million credit facility used for cash management purposes 
our capital structure also includes nonrecourse secured debt that we assume in conjunction with some of our acquisitions 
we also have nonrecourse debt secured by newly developed properties held in several of our joint ventures 
we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain a third party consent  such as assets held in entities in which we have less than ownership 
investing activities acquisitions in we invested million in the acquisition of shopping centers  a building adjacent to one of our shopping centers and seven industrial properties 
an additional million was invested in a owned unconsolidated joint venture to acquire two retail properties 
the cash requirements for these acquisitions were initially financed either under our revolving credit facilities  using available cash generated from dispositions of properties or cash flow generated by our operating properties 
investing activities dispositions in thirteen shopping centers and a vacant retail building in lubbock  texas were sold 
ten of the shopping centers were located in texas and one each in louisiana  arkansas and mississippi 
in addition  we sold three industrial properties in las vegas  nevada and grapevine and austin  texas 
we also sold an interest in two additional shopping centers located in shreveport and lafayette  louisiana 
these properties  totaling million square feet  provided sales proceeds of million and generated gains of million 
investing activities new development and capital expenditures with respect to new development  we completed three retail projects during totaling  square feet  representing an investment of million 
as of december   we had nine retail projects and one apartment complex in various stages of development 
these projects  upon completion  will represent an investment of million and add million square feet to the portfolio 
we expect to invest million in these projects in  and they are slated to open during and into all new development in was initially financed under our revolving credit facilities  using available cash generated from dispositions of properties or cash flow generated by our operating properties 

table of contents capital expenditures for additions to the existing portfolio  acquisitions  new development and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaled million in and million in financing activities debt total debt outstanding increased to billion at december  from billion at december   due primarily to funding of acquisitions and new development 
total debt at december  includes billion of which interest rates are fixed and million  which bears interest at variable rates  including the effect of million of interest rate swaps 
additionally  debt totaling million was secured by operating properties while the remaining billion was unsecured 
at december   we had a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
this facility bears interest at libor plus a grid based margin tied to our senior unsecured credit agency ratings  which is currently basis points on amounts outstanding 
we pay an additional facility fee of basis points on the entire facility amount 
under this facility  we are allowed to request bids for borrowings up to million from the syndicate banks 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the competitive bid provision at basis points over libor 
in february we amended and restated our million unsecured revolving credit facility 
terms and conditions of this facility held by a syndicate of banks are not materially different from the agreement executed in the amended facility has an initial four year term and provides a one year extension option available at our request 
borrowing rates under this amended facility float at a margin over libor  plus a facility fee 
the borrowing margin and facility fee  which are currently and basis points  respectively  are priced off a grid that is tied to our senior unsecured credit ratings 
the amended facility retains its competitive bid feature that allows us to request bids for amounts up to million from the syndicate banks 
additionally  the amended facility contains an accordion feature  which will allow us to increase the facility amount up to million 
as of february   the balance outstanding on this facility was million all under the competitive bid provision at basis points over libor 
we also maintain a million unsecured and uncommitted overnight facility that is used for cash management purposes  of which million was outstanding at february  we are in full compliance with the covenants of this facility 
during the year ended december   we issued a total of million of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of  net of the effect of related interest rate swaps  and a weighted average term of years 
proceeds received from the medium term note issuances were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
in december we entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps  with a notional amount of million each  to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest rates on forecasted long term debt issuances over a maximum period of two years 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
during we had four interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million mature 
all of these contracts were designated as fair value hedges 
at december   we have six remaining fair value interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that convert fixed rate interest payments ranging from to to variable interest payments 
in two interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and two interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges expired 
also  we settled various forward starting interest rate swaps designed to hedge the cash flow of forecasted interest payments on future debt 
these contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and net losses on the settlement of these cash flow hedges totaling million were recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the hedged item 

table of contents the effect of the fair value interest rate swap activity in   and was to decrease interest expense and increase net income by million  million  and million  respectively  and to decrease the average rate on our debt by 
in and by 
in both and we could be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter party  however  management believes the likelihood of such nonperformance to be remote 
in conjunction with acquisitions completed during and  we assumed million and million  respectively  of nonrecourse debt secured by the related properties 
financing activities equity common and preferred dividends increased to million in  compared to million for the dividend rate for the common shares for each quarter of was

for the same periods in our dividend payout ratio on common equity for  and approximated   and  respectively  based on funds from operations for the applicable period 
in september the sec declared effective two shelf registration statements registering billion of debt and equity securities  all of which was available as of february  in addition  we have million available as of february  under our billion shelf registration statement  which became effective in april we will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider our available financing alternatives  including both public and private placements 
in february a three for two share split  effected in the form of a share dividend  was declared for shareholders of record on march   payable march  we issued million common shares of beneficial interest as a result of the share split 
all references to the number of shares and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the share split  and an amount equal to the par value of the number of common shares issued have been reclassified to common shares of beneficial interest from accumulated dividends in excess of net income 
in march we issued an additional million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to us totaled million 
the proceeds from this offering were used primarily to redeem our series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares on april  the unamortized original issuance costs of million for these shares were reported as a loss in arriving at operating income 
in august we issued an additional million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to us totaled million 
the proceeds from this offering were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
in july we issued million of depositary shares 
each depositary share represents one hundredth of a series e cumulative redeemable preferred share 
the depositary shares are redeemable  in whole or in part  for cash on or after july  at our option  at a redemption price of per depositary share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon 
the depositary shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any of our other property or securities 
the series e preferred shares pay a annual dividend and have a liquidation value of  per share 
net proceeds of million were utilized to pay down amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
subsequent to year end  our board of trust managers authorized up to million for the purchase of outstanding common shares of beneficial interest 
share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions during the next twelve months 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands thereafter total mortgages and notes payable unsecured debt secured debt ground lease payments obligations to acquire projects obligations to develop projects total contractual obligations includes principal and interest with interest on variable rate debt calculated using rates at december  as of december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that would materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirement for  our capital resources 
funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
we believe ffo is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because it helps investors compare our operating performance relative to other reits 
management also uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness

r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
this accounting standard focuses primarily on equity transactions with employees and will be effective in our reporting for the year beginning january  through december   we recorded compensation expense over the vesting period on awards granted since january  awards granted prior to january  were not recorded as compensation expense  but their impact on net income was disclosed 
under sfas no

table of contents in june the fasb ratified the consensus in eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights

fsp no 
sop eliminates the concept of important rights and replaces it with concepts of kick out rights and substantive participating rights as defined in eitf issue no 
fsp no 
sop and eitf issue no 
are effective for all general partners of partnerships formed or modified after june   and for all other partnerships the first reporting period beginning after december  we have applied fsp no 
sop and eitf issue no 
to our joint ventures and concluded that these pronouncements did not require consolidation of additional entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income and future cash flows would decrease by million and million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  and  respectively  and the fair value of fixed rate debt at december  and would decrease by million and million  respectively
