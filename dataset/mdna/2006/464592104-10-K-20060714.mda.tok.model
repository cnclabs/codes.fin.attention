executive overview we are a leading developer  owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related lodging and entertainment facilities in regional markets in the united states and internationally 
we continue to investigate developing new locations  purchasing existing operations and expanding our current properties 
these activities require capital intensive investments that have long term return potential 
we have intentionally sought geographic diversity to limit the risks caused by weather  regional economic difficulties  and local gaming authorities and regulations 
we currently operate casinos in mississippi  louisiana  missouri  iowa  colorado and freeport  grand bahama island 
we operate a harness racing track in florida 
additionally  we have a controlling interest in casino investments in dudley  wolverhampton and walsall  england  each of which is operated by the minority owners 
the following discussion includes results only from our continuing operations 
the following table reflects our consolidated net revenues and operating income by state isle of capri casinos  inc 
consolidated statements of operations in thousands fiscal year ended april  april  variance variance net revenues mississippi lousiana missouri iowa colorado international corporate and other total net revenues operating income mississippi lousiana missouri iowa colorado international corporate and other operating income note exlcudes isle vicksburg  isle bossier city and colorado grande cripple creek which have been classified as discontinued operations in mississippi  our three continuing operations contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues and operating income were up million and million  respectively  compared to prior year 
the primary reason for these increases were a new and upgraded land based casino at the isle biloxi  limited competition in the biloxi market due to closures related to hurricane katrina  and continuing effects of a population shift into the isle natchez market 
isle lula s results remained consistent with prior year 
in louisiana  the isle lake charles contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues decreased million and operating income decreased million over prior year 
isle lake charles experienced a decrease in net revenues and operating income  compared to the prior year period  due to the addition of a competitor and the disruptions and charges related to hurricane rita 
in missouri  our two properties contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues were down million and operating income was up million 
isle kansas city s net revenues and operating income were down due to a decreased gaming patron count caused primarily by the completion of competitors expansion projects in the market 
isle boonville s net revenues and operating income increased due to an increase in marketing efforts 
in iowa  our three casinos contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues decreased million primarily due to increased competition and operating income decreased million primarily due to increased marketing costs as compared to the prior year 
in colorado  our two black hawk properties contributed million or of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended april  net revenues were up million and operating income was up million over prior year 
during fiscal  construction at our black hawk properties  which significantly reduced parking for the colorado central station black hawk and restricted access to the street entrances to both black hawk casinos  adversely impacted net revenues and operating income by million and million  respectively 
in june  we completed the casino expansions at both casinos  a new restaurant  the skywalks connecting the casinos to the new garage and a total of new parking spaces thus ending the most disruptive phase of our black hawk expansion projects 
construction of the new room colorado central station hotel was completed in december the extension of main street to colorado route  temporarily delayed by engineering challenges  opened in the first quarter of fiscal in our international locations  we experienced an increase in net revenues of million 
operating income decreased million primarily due to million in valuation and other charges related to blue chip and the isle our lucaya 
in april  our board of directors approved a plan to close the isle our lucaya facility 
effective june   we notified our landlord of our decision to terminate the lease and we intend to cease operations by june  as required by our lease 
in conjunction with exercising the lease termination  we paid a million fee to our landlord to terminate the lease early 
this amount will be expensed  in accordance with sfas on the date of notification  which was in the first quarter of fiscal year we will continue to report the results of the isle our lucaya property as continuing operations until a probable sale of this facility is reached or operations are ceased at which time these results will be reported as discontinued operations 
in corporate and other  our new development expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended april   up from million for the same period in the previous fiscal year 
this is primarily due to our continuing development efforts in pompano beach  florida  waterloo  iowa  pittsburgh  pennsylvania  singapore  and the united kingdom as well as other initial investments to proposed future projects 
additional costs have been incurred due to the ongoing relocation of the corporate offices to the st 
louis  missouri metropolitan area which is expected to be completed in late calendar year critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  those estimates where  had we chosen different estimates or assumptions  the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations  and those estimates that  if they were to change from period to period  likely would result in a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
based upon management s discussion of the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  we believe the following accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and other intangible assets at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of million  representing of total assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets below their carrying value 
we completed our annual impairment test as required under sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for properties with goodwill and or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment of million  representing of total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
costs incurred in connection with our other capital improvements  program  as detailed in the liquidity and capital resources section below  include individual capital expenditures related to the purchase of furniture and equipment and to the upgrade of hotel rooms  restaurants and other areas of our properties 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue for these liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
insurance accounting we have recorded an impairment charge of million based on current assessments of damages related to the impact of hurricanes 
the impairment charge is offset by an insurance receivable for the amount we expect to recover from our insurance carriers under our policy coverages 
we have incurred million for incremental out of pocket costs related to the hurricanes and the property operating costs related to the periods affected by the hurricanes 
these amounts are included in the hurricane related charges  net in the accompanying statements of income 
the company has insurance coverage related to damage from the three hurricanes for property damage incurred  property operating costs during the operational downtime of the hurricanes  incremental costs incurred related to hurricane damage and recovery activities and business interruption insurance for lost profits during the period directly related to the hurricanes 
the total amount of losses recognized and expenses incurred of million has been recorded in the accompanying statement of income as hurricane related charges  net and have been offset by the amount of million  which the company believes is probable that it will collect from its insurance carriers under its policy coverages 
the remaining amount of million represents the company s deductible portion of its claims 
the company believes it will receive proceeds from its insurance carrier related to all four types of losses the company has sustained  and through july  has received advances of million  of which million was received by april  when the company and its insurance carriers agree on the final amount of the insurance proceeds the company is entitled to  the company will also record any related gain in this account 
the company s insurance policies also provide coverage for the loss of profits caused by the storms 
any lost profit recoveries will be recognized when agreed to with the insurance carrier and will be reflected in the related properties revenues 
income tax assets and liabilities we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as various states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  when we believe that we will be unable to utilize the benefits of those assets on our tax returns 
changes to the valuation allowance are recorded in the period when we revise our estimate of the recoverability of the related deferred assets 
as indicated in note  we have provided a valuation allowance for certain state net operating losses nols  and other deferred tax assets as of april  and april  other than these exceptions  we are unaware of any circumstances that would cause the remaining deferred tax assets to not be realizable 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities 
while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws  we do not take such positions unless we have substantial authority to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations 
we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs or other taxing authorities 
we assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis 
in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas no 
is met  we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits 
we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 
we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved 
when actual results differ from reserve estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved 
for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and have identified certain loss contingencies 
we record liabilities related to these contingencies when it is determined that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
these assessments are based on our knowledge and experience as well as the advice of legal counsel regarding current and past events 
any such estimates are also subject to future events  court rulings  negotiations between the parties and other uncertainties 
if an actual loss differs from our estimate  or the actual outcome of any of the legal proceedings differs from expectations  operating results could be impacted 
we routinely face challenges from federal and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we record tax accruals for probable exposures associated with the various filing positions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
slot club awards we reward our slot customers for their loyalty based on the dollar amount of play on slot machines 
we accrue for these slot club awards based on an estimate of the value of the outstanding awards utilizing the age and prior history of redemptions 
future events such as a change in our marketing strategy or new competition could result in a change in the value of the awards 
results of operations our results of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and april   reflect the consolidated operations of all of our subsidiaries and include the following properties the isle lake charles  the isle biloxi  the isle lula  the isle natchez  the isle kansas city  the isle boonville  the isle bettendorf  the isle marquette  the rhythm city davenport  the isle black hawk  the colorado central station black hawk  the isle our lucaya  the blue chip dudley  the blue chip wolverhampton  the blue chip walsall and pompano park 
fiscal and results have been reclassified to reflect the isle vicksburg  the isle bossier city and colorado grande cripple creek as discontinued operations 
our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in april 
this fiscal year convention creates more comparability of our quarterly operations  by generally having an equal number of weeks and weekend days in each quarter 
periodically  this convention necessitates a week year 
the fiscal year ended april  was a week year 
the extra week was included in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our results of operations for the fiscal year ended april   reflect the consolidated operations of all of our subsidiaries  and includes the following properties the isle lake charles  the isle biloxi  the isle lula  the isle natchez  the isle kansas city  the isle boonville  the isle bettendorf  the isle marquette  the rhythm city davenport  the isle black hawk  the colorado central station black hawk  the lady luck las vegas  the isle our lucaya  the blue chip dudley  the blue chip wolverhampton  the blue chip walsall and pompano park

the isle our lucaya began operations in december of we purchased a two thirds interest in blue chip casinos  plc blue chip in november of blue chip owns and operates a pub style casino in dudley  england  and a pub style casino in wolverhampton  england  which began operations in april of fiscal results have been reclassified to reflect the isle vicksburg  the isle bossier city and colorado grande cripple creek as discontinued operations 
we believe that our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the substantial present and expected future increase in competition for gaming customers in each of our markets  as new gaming facilities open and existing gaming facilities expand or enhance their facilities 
we believe that our operating results are materially affected by the economy and weather 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april  were billion  which included billion of casino revenue  million of room revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions  million of food and beverage revenue and million of other revenue 
this compares to gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april  of billion  which included million of casino revenue  million of room revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions  million of food and beverage revenue and million of other revenue 
casino revenue increased compared to fiscal year we saw an increase in casino revenues at our mississippi properties due to isle biloxi s limited competition following re opening as a result of hurricane katrina and upgraded land based casino  effects of population growth in the isle natchez market because of hurricane relocations and an improved marketing program at isle lula 
likewise  casino revenues increased at the isle s colorado casinos due to the completion of the expansion projects 
isle lake charles saw a decline in casino revenues due to the entry of a new competitor and the disruptions caused by hurricane rita 
our iowa properties saw flat casino revenues 
the isle kansas city saw a drop in revenues due to decreased patron count caused by completion of competitors expansion projects in the market 
isle booneville casino revenues increased due to an increase in marketing efforts

pari mutuel commissions earned at pompano park in florida for the fiscal year increased compared to prior year 
food and beverage revenues increased by 
promotional allowances  which are made up of complimentary revenues  cash points and coupons  are rewards that we give our loyal customers and incentives given to both existing and potential customers to encourage future patronage at our properties 
these allowances increased by in fiscal year as we increased our direct mail efforts to promote play and the addition of isle play at our mississippi properties 
casino operating expenses decreased over fiscal year these expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  wages and benefits and other operating expenses of the casinos 
casino operating expenses have decreased despite an increase in casino revenue primarily due to temporary closures of operations in biloxi  lake charles and pompano caused by hurricanes in fiscal and certain operating costs at these properties being offset with expected insurance recoveries related to the closures 
for further discussion  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
state and local gaming taxes increased by compared to fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gaming revenues 
room expenses increased compared to fiscal year these expenses directly relate to the cost of providing hotel rooms 
the increase in expenses was due primarily to the additional room capacity at the isle biloxi and increased guest counts at isle natchez and isle lake charles 
pari mutuel operating costs of pompano park in florida increased compared to fiscal year such costs consist primarily of compensation  benefits  purses  simulcast fees and other direct costs of track operations 
food and beverage expenses increased over fiscal year food and beverage expenses as a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended april   to for the fiscal year ended april  these expenses consist primarily of the cost of goods sold  salaries  wages and benefits and other operating expenses of these departments 
food  beverage and other expenses as a percentage of gross food  beverage and other revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended april   to for the fiscal year ended april  these expenses increased partly as a result of the expansion at the colorado property 
marine and facilities expenses increased compared to fiscal year these expenses include salaries  wages and benefits of the marine and facilities departments  operating expenses of the marine crews  insurance  maintenance of public areas  housekeeping and general maintenance of the riverboats and pavilions 
the increase was primarily due to the isle s colorado expansion projects that came on line during marketing expenses increased compared to fiscal year the increase in marketing expenses is primarily due to the additional marketing of our colorado properties after the completion of the expansion projects and additional corporate marketing expenses 
marketing expenses include salaries  wages and benefits of the marketing and sales departments  as well as promotions  direct mail  advertising  special events and entertainment 
administrative expenses  which include administration and human resource department expenses  rent  new development activities  professional fees  insurance and property taxes  have increased over fiscal year the increase is due primarily to the settlement of the jefferson county  missouri lawsuit and increased development and investment activities 
in florida  we supported the successful campaign to pass a constitutional amendment that allows the voters of miami dade and broward counties to decide whether to approve slot machines in racetracks and jai alai facilities in their respective counties 
we are continuing to pursue a slot parlor license in pittsburgh  pennsylvania and have joined with resort developer eighth wonder in applying to operate a casino resort in singapore 
additionally  we expect administrative expenses to increase in fiscal primarily due to costs related to moving the corporate office from mississippi to missouri and expected substantial increased property insurance premiums related to increases in recent hurricane activity in our southern region 
depreciation expense increased by compared to fiscal year depreciation has increased as a result of our capital expansion programs 
in fiscal  we recorded million in impairment and severance related charges on the isle our lucaya property due to the change in future expected cash flows resulting from our decision to close the casino by june of as a result of adverse market conditions on the expected future cash flows of the blue chip operations  we recorded additional impairment charges of million related to the blue chip properties

net interest expense increased compared with fiscal year this is primarily attributable to the higher average balances outstanding and higher interest rates on our variable rate debt and an increase in capitalized interest from million in the fiscal year ended april  to million in fiscal year ended april  the increase in capitalized interest results from the ongoing construction at coventry  england and expansion projects at pompano park and isle boonville 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended april  was compared to for the year ended april   which  in each case  excludes our joint venture partner s portion of the colorado central station black hawk s income taxes 
this increase in effective rate over the comparable prior fiscal period is primarily attributable to the impact of not benefiting from a portion of our current losses in the united kingdom at this time  and not benefiting from the capital loss related to the colorado grande cripple creek transaction at this time because of a lack of capital gains to offset against the loss 
as part of our ongoing operations  we will continue to evaluate prudent tax planning strategies to maximize the benefits of existing tax attributes  however  no assurance can be made that this can be achieved 
for further discussion  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements

likewise  casino revenues increased at the isle lake charles resulting from the expansion and renovation of the grand palais 
the addition of the isle our lucaya and the blue chip dudley also increased casino revenues as these properties opened in the third quarter of fiscal these increases were offset by the sale of the lady luck las vegas 
in colorado  casino revenues declined as the isle black hawk and the colorado central station black hawk have been affected by construction disruption 
we also faced decreases in casino revenues at the isle biloxi because of construction and the aftermath of hurricane ivan 
room revenue decreased compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of construction at the isle biloxi 
pari mutuel commissions earned at pompano park in florida for the fiscal year was essentially flat compared to prior year

these allowances increased by in fiscal year as we increased our direct mail efforts to promote play 
casino operating expenses increased over fiscal year these expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  wages and benefits and other operating expenses of the casinos 
the increase in casino operating expenses is attributable to the addition of the isle our lucaya and blue chip 
this increase is partially offset by the discontinuation of gaming operations at the lady luck las vegas  following the finalization of the property s sale 
state and local gaming taxes increased by compared to fiscal year effective july   we were subject to an additional assessment of of gross gaming revenues in iowa due to a tax increase enacted in that state 
room expenses decreased compared to fiscal year these expenses directly relate to the cost of providing hotel rooms 
other costs of the hotels are shared with the casinos and are presented in their respective expense categories 
the decrease in expenses was due primarily to the loss of room capacity due to construction at the isle biloxi pari mutuel operating costs of pompano park in florida increase compared to fiscal year such costs consist primarily of compensation  benefits  purses  simulcast fees and other direct costs of track operations

marine and facilities expenses increased compared to fiscal year these expenses include salaries  wages and benefits of the marine and facilities departments  operating expenses of the marine crews  insurance  maintenance of public areas  housekeeping and general maintenance of the riverboats and pavilions 
the increase was primarily due to ongoing repairs and maintenance at the isle lula and the addition of the isle our lucaya

administrative expenses have increased over fiscal year these expenses include administration and human resource department expenses  rent  new development activities  professional fees  insurance and property taxes 
the increase is due to the addition of the isle our lucaya and blue chip 
we also increased our development and investment activities domestically and in the united kingdom 
in florida  we supported the successful campaign to pass a constitutional amendment that allows the voters of miami dade and broward counties to decide whether to approve slot machines in racetracks and jai alai facilities in their respective counties 
these increases were partially offset by finalization of the sale and discontinuation of all operations at the lady luck las vegas and savings from combining some administrative functions of the isle bettendorf and the rhythm city davenport properties 
depreciation expense increased by compared to fiscal year depreciation has increased as a result of our capital expansion programs 
the increase was primarily due to a one time charge for additional depreciation expense of million related to a reclassification of certain land improvements that were improperly classified as land at the time of the conversion of our manual system to a computerized asset tracking system in fiscal  identified in the second fiscal quarter of  as well as the capital additions at the isle biloxi  the isle lake charles and the isle kansas city 
in fiscal year  we recorded a gain on the sale of a land option in st 
louis  missouri in addition to impairment related charges of million related to fixed assets in the united kingdom and million on our investment in a license in rosemont  illinois 
we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt totaling million in fiscal in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facility on february  these charges include the write off of debt acquisition costs 
we also incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million in fiscal related to the amendment of our million senior subordinated notes on march  these charges included early payment premiums as well as the write off of debt acquisition costs 
net interest expense decreased compared with fiscal year this is primarily attributable to the lower average balances outstanding and an increase in capitalized interest from million in the fiscal year ended april  to million in fiscal year ended april  the increase in capitalized interest results from the expansion projects at the isle biloxi and in black hawk 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the fiscal year ended april   compared to for fiscal year ended april   which  in each case  excludes our joint venture partner s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes 
the increase in the rate for fiscal is a result of the effect of non deductible permanent items on earnings  the impact of not benefiting  at this time  from a portion of the current operating losses of our interests in the united kingdom and state income taxes 
also in the second fiscal quarter ended  the internal revenue service concluded a federal tax examination covering four tax years without significant adjustments and provided administrative guidance on certain other tax matters for other open years 
as a result  we analyzed our tax accruals and reduced income tax expense by approximately million for previously accrued income tax liabilities 
this had the effect of reducing our effective tax rate to from continuing operations  excluding the minority interest s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes 
excluding the impact of these adjustments  our fiscal year effective rate from continuing operations would have been  excluding the minority interest s portion of the colorado central station black hawk income taxes 
for further discussion  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at april   the end of our last fiscal year 
of this million decrease  is a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and is the net result of million net cash provided by operating activities  million net cash used in investing activities  million net cash provided by financing activities and million decrease in cash from the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
the remaining increase of million is marketable securities held by capri insurance corporation  which is available to pay insurance claims 
in addition  as of april   we had million of unused capacity under lines of credit and available term debt consisting of million in unused credit capacity under the revolving loan commitment on our senior secured credit facility  million of unused credit capacity with the isle black hawk s senior secured credit facility limited to use by the isle black hawk  and million under other lines of credit and available term debt 
during the year ended april   the isle black hawk paid off million  net of borrowings  on its revolving loan under the isle black hawk s senior secured credit facility 
we also had borrowings  net of payments of million under other lines of credit 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance  our cash flows from operations  the financing sources discussed herein  planned asset sales and expected hurricane insurance proceeds will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements during the next twelve months and to fund additional investments 
in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or growth or to refinance existing debt 
investing activities we invested million in property and equipment during fiscal year  including accrued purchases of million 
these amounts exclude million related to the isle biloxi casino barge destroyed by hurricane katrina and the subsequent costs related to the temporary casino that we expect to recover from insurance proceeds

this project was completed prior to hurricane katrina  with the exception of the spa 
in october  we announced plans to replace the casino at isle biloxi with a new state of the art casino facility  which was expected to cost approximately million and was expected to open in december the isle biloxi casino barge and the new casino barge were destroyed by hurricane katrina 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  isle biloxi completed the renovation of its existing atrium adding additional gaming space bringing the casino resort to approximately  gaming positions  opening a new multi story entry feature and bar  and connecting the parking deck with the atrium by a covered walkway 
we continue to evaluate our redevelopment opportunities for the isle biloxi and expect a significant portion of these costs to be funded through anticipated insurance proceeds 
we have signed a development agreement with the city of bettendorf pursuant to which we agreed to construct a new room isle hotel  additional parking  a new restaurant  and an expansion of the existing buffet and the city agreed to construct a  square foot convention center adjacent to the facility  which will be managed by isle bettendorf 
the cost of our portion of this project is approximately million  and the new hotel is scheduled to open in the spring of in november  voters in the state of florida amended the state s constitution to allow the voters of miami dade and broward counties broward county is the location of the pompano park racetrack to decide whether to approve slot machines in racetracks and jai alai frontons in their respective counties

on march   we announced that we had been selected by the illinois gaming board as the successful bidder in a federal bankruptcy court auction for the th illinois gaming license previously issued to emerald casinos  inc this process was conducted pursuant to an agreement approved by  among other parties  the illinois attorney general 
we bid million to acquire by merger the stock of a company in bankruptcy that owns the license 
the plan of reorganization pursuant to which the merger would be consummated has been confirmed by the federal bankruptcy court 
the merger remains subject to certain conditions  including a finding of suitability and final approval by the illinois gaming board as well as certain other conditions 
the entire matter also is the subject of ongoing litigation of which we are not a party 
the illinois attorney general has raised issues with regard to the appropriateness of the village of rosemont as a host community and the illinois gaming board s selection of our bid 
in addition  in the illinois gaming board  based on a recommendation by an administrative law judge following a hearing  revoked the license issued to emerald on the basis of emerald s past conduct which revocation has been stayed pending the outcome of litigation 
for the reasons set forth above  among others  we believe that our ability to obtain the gaming license and open a gaming facility in rosemont has been subjected to added uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately acquire the license 
the full cost of the license and all associated costs were originally capitalized in the amount of million 
due to the continuing uncertainty with respect to this matter  we recorded a valuation charge of million for these capitalized license costs at april  in october   we loaned million to florida gaming corporation florida gaming 
interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance of the loan at an annual rate of and is paid in arrears on the first day of each fiscal quarter 
the loan is secured by a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of florida gaming centers  inc fgc  a wholly owned subsidiary of florida gaming 
the entire unpaid principal amount of the loan and unpaid interest thereon is payable on the earlier of the sale of all or any material portion of the assets of  or all or any substantial equity interest in fgc  or december  concurrently with the loan  florida gaming and fgc entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which florida gaming and fgc gave us exclusive negotiating rights with respect to the acquisition of all or substantially all of fgc s miami jai alai business for a period ending no later than december  in may  we signed a casino management and related development and option agreements with resort developer eighth wonder to manage the casino included in eighth wonder s proposal for a new integrated resort complex in singapore should eighth wonder be selected to develop such complex 
during the fiscal quarter ended july   we paid and expensed a million payment to eighth wonder pursuant to the terms of these agreements 
if eighth wonder is awarded this project  upon the occurrence of certain milestones  we will pay a total of million in concession fees to eighth wonder for the right to operate the casino and a room hotel 
in december  we signed a joint development agreement with lemieux group lp that includes a provision for us to fund a million new multi purpose arena and pursue a gaming license at a cost of approximately million for a stand alone slot parlor in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
plans include the new multi purpose arena and a million gaming facility  with  slot machines  that are part of a larger billion dollar effort known as pittsburgh first to redevelop the lower hill and uptown districts in conjunction with the pittsburgh penguins and a development partner 
this proposal is one of three applications under consideration by the pennsylvania gaming control board for a single license with a decision expected by the end of calendar or early if the license is granted to us  we anticipate that the construction of the project would begin shortly thereafter with a temporary casino also a possibility 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of the gaming control board  license grant date  the final design of the gaming facility and the timing of obtaining the necessary permits  we have not included this project in the above table 
we have issued a million stand by letter of credit to the pennsylvania gaming control board in connection with our license application 
other capital improvements include maintenance capital items and other small projects 
we expense all developmental costs until we determine that ultimate licensure and operation is deemed probable 
at that time  we evaluate the applicable costs and capitalize if appropriate 
all of our development plans are subject to obtaining permits  licenses and approvals from appropriate regulatory and other agencies and  in certain circumstances  negotiating acceptable leases 
in addition  many of the plans are preliminary  subject to continuing refinement or otherwise subject to change 
financing activities during the fiscal year ended april   we had net sources of cash from financing of million primarily in the following financing activities we exercised a million delayed draw term loan available under our senior secured credit facility and made additional net borrowings of million 
we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
we made principal payments on our senior secured credit facility and other debt of million 
we purchased  shares of our common stock at a total cost of million we paid million in costs related to the black hawk financing costs we had net borrowings under the isle black hawk senior secured credit facility of million 
during fiscal  we modified the covenants related to the isle black hawk senior secured credit facility to align the covenants with the financial impact of construction at isle black hawk 
the isle black hawk is in compliance with all covenants contained in our senior and subordinated debt instruments as of april  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance  our cash flows from operations  planned asset sales  our expected hurricane insurance proceeds and the financing sources discussed herein  will be sufficient to meet our normal operating requirements during the next fiscal year and to fund additional investments 
in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or our developments or to refinance existing debt 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
as a result  limitations on our capital resources could delay or cause us to abandon certain plans for capital improvements at our existing properties and or development of new properties 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations as well as opportunities to acquire or invest in companies  properties and other projects that meet our strategic and return on investment criteria 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change significantly in future periods

recently issued accounting standards on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
generally  the accounting method required by sfas r is similar to the accounting method required by sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair market values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period of our first fiscal year that begins on or after june  we are required to adopt sfas r on may  we have elected to apply the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on its result of operations 
the initial impact of adoption of sfas r is discussed in footnote related to the fair market value of options that are not vested at the effective date of adoption 
we are also required to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered in lieu of accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
as r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior secured credit facility and the isle black hawk senior secured credit facility 
isle black hawk senior secured credit facility the isle black hawk has entered into seven interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of million  or of its variable rate term debt  outstanding under the isle black hawk senior secured credit facility as of april  the swap agreements were entered in to effectively convert portions of its variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis until the fourth fiscal quarter of  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
these interest rate swap agreements terminate in fiscal year during fiscal year  the swaps were not designated as effective hedges 
the following table provides information at april  about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rate sensitivity principal notional amount by expected maturity average interest swap rate fiscal year fair value dollars in millions thereafter total liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivative financial instruments related to debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable average pay rate average receive rate represents the annual average libor from the forward yield curve at april  plus the weighted average margin above libor on all consolidated variable rate debt 
fair value represents the amount we would have to receive from the counter party if we had terminated the swap agreements at april  we are also exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates related to our ownership interests and development activities in the united kingdom 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange risk through obtaining  when it is practical to do so  financing in the united kingdom 
for the fiscal year ended april   we recorded a loss of million in foreign currency translation adjustments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
foreign currency translation adjustments show the cumulative effect  at the balance sheet date  of fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate on balances denominated in a foreign currency  which were recorded at a historical rate at the transaction date
