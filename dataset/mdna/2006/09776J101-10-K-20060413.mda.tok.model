item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview bon ton was founded in and  with the acquisition of ndsg  is the second largest regional department store operator in terms of sales in the united states  offering a broad assortment of brand name fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children as well as cosmetics  home furnishings and other goods 
at january   bon ton operated stores in mid sized markets in northeastern and midwestern states under the bon ton and elder beerman nameplates that encompass a total of approximately million gross square feet 
we believe that bon ton s stores hold the or market position among department stores in most of the markets in which it operates 
bon ton had net sales of billion in fiscal effective march   pursuant to the october  purchase agreement with saks  bon ton completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding securities of two subsidiaries of saks that are solely related to the business of owning and operating the retail department stores that comprised ndsg and operated under the names carson pirie scott  younkers  herberger s  boston store and bergner s 
the stores are located in twelve states in the midwest and upper great plains regions 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  bon ton paid approximately billion in cash for ndsg 
the purchase price remains subject to certain post closing adjustments 
ndsg s stores encompass a total of approximately million gross square feet in mid sized and metropolitan markets 
we believe that ndsg s stores hold the or market position among department stores in most of the markets in which they operate 
ndsg had net sales of approximately billion in fiscal to finance the acquisition and the related refinancing of bon ton s previous revolving credit facility  we entered into a new revolving credit facility which provides for up to billion in borrowings  issued million in senior unsecured notes  and entered into a new mortgage loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
after the acquisition of ndsg  we are now the second largest regional department store operator in the united states  in terms of sales  with stores that encompass a total of approximately million gross square feet across the northeastern  midwestern and great plains states 
we believe that the acquisition will enhance our product offerings  strengthen our vendor and customer relationships and increase our profitability 
our scale will make us an important distribution channel for leading merchandise vendors and will enhance our ability to offer our customers nationally distributed brands and exclusive merchandise 
furthermore  we believe that we will continue to enjoy the or market position among department stores in most of the markets in which we operate 
we compete in the department store segment of the us retail industry 
department stores have historically dominated apparel and accessories retailing  occupying a cornerstone in the us retail landscape for more than years 
over time  department stores have evolved from single unit  family owned  urban locations to regional and national chains serving communities of all sizes 
the department store industry continues to evolve in response to ongoing consolidation among apparel and accessory vendors as well as the evolution of competitive retail formats mass merchandisers  national chain retailers  specialty retailers and online retailers 
our segment of the retail industry is highly competitive  and we anticipate that competitive pressures and challenges will continue in the foreseeable future 
on march   we announced the closing of our  square foot bergner s store located in the colonial village mall in rockford  illinois in mid may fiscal overview net sales for fiscal were  million as compared to  million in fiscal  a decrease of 
comparable store net sales for fiscal decreased 
the comparable store net sales decline was the result of several factors including  among others sales of discontinued merchandise in fiscal  which reflected the realignment of non common assortments during the integration of elder beerman and bon ton 
these goods generated clearance sales of approximately million in fiscal unseasonably cold weather in the spring season and warm weather in the third quarter within bon ton s operating regions  which negatively affected apparel sales in fiscal the general retail environment in fiscal  reflecting lack of consumer confidence and concerns related to higher gas and heating costs 
in connection with the credit card sale  bon ton recorded pre tax charges of million in fiscal  representing a loss on the sale  costs associated with involuntary termination benefits and contract terminations  and accelerated depreciation 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale  million  was used to terminate bon ton s accounts receivable securitization program  the remaining proceeds of million were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under bon ton s revolving credit facility 
in connection with the sale  bon ton entered into two agreements with hsbc an interim servicing agreement the isa and a credit card program agreement the ccpa 
under the terms of the isa  bon ton continued to service the credit card receivables from july  through october   for which bon ton was compensated 
the ccpa sets forth the terms and conditions under which hsbc will issue credit cards to bon ton s customers 
under the ccpa  bon ton is paid a percentage of net credit sales for credit card sales generated after july  the ccpa has a term of seven years and is cancelable earlier by either party under certain circumstances 
on september   bon ton announced several real estate initiatives  which included the expansion of three stores  the relocation of two stores  and the closing of two stores in the syracuse  new york market and one store in lebanon  pennsylvania 
in addition  on november  bon ton announced the closing of its walden galleria store in buffalo  new york 
all four store closings were effective january  in connection with these closings  bon ton recorded a pre tax charge of million  representing costs associated with involuntary termination benefits  a lease termination and accelerated depreciation expense 
results of operations the following table summarizes changes in bon ton s selected operating indicators  illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for each fiscal year presented components may not add or subtract to totals because of rounding percent of net sales fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales other income costs and expenses costs of merchandise sold selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales were  million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  as compared to fiscal comparable store sales decreased in fiscal the best performing merchandise categories in fiscal were women s special size included in women s apparel  footwear  home and intimate apparel 
sales for women s special size reflect increased inventory  added space in stores and increased advertising exposure 
footwear sales increased as customers responded favorably to bon ton s focus on maximizing key casual vendors  store intensifications and increased advertising exposure 
the home sales increase resulted from key item maximization in soft home and new product offerings in hard home 
intimate apparel sales benefited from a narrowed assortment that ensured size availability in the foundations area 
the poorest performing merchandise categories in fiscal were dresses and coats included in women s apparel and juniors apparel 
apparel sales in fiscal were hampered by unseasonably cold weather during the spring season and unseasonably warm weather in the third quarter 
other income other income  which includes income from program revenue under the ccpa  leased departments and other customer revenues  increased million in fiscal over fiscal primarily because of the revenue received under the ccpa in the fourth quarter of fiscal after the july  credit card sale  bon ton continued to service the credit card receivables through october   proceeds earned pursuant to the ccpa during this period were recorded within selling  general and administrative expense 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars for fiscal decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal  reflecting lower sales volume and a reduced gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  a decrease of percentage point from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin rate reflects a decreased markup rate and higher shrinkage partially offset by a lower markdown rate 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease reflects reduced integration expenses and store payroll  partially offset by increased advertising expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased million  to million  in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  bon ton recognized approximately million of accelerated charges on software associated with bon ton s credit operation

income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal included in the provision for fiscal was an income tax benefit adjustment of approximately million principally associated with a net reduction of the income tax valuation allowances that were established in connection with the october purchase of elder beerman 
net income net income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal in october  bon ton added sixty seven department stores and two furniture stores as a result of its acquisition of elder beerman 
bon ton s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of income for fiscal include elder beerman operations for the period from october  through january  bon ton believes that the fiscal operating results are not comparable to results for fiscal because of the timing of the elder beerman acquisition 
specifically  bon ton included elder beerman s most profitable quarter in the fiscal operating results without having to recognize the first three quarters of the year  which traditionally reflect a net loss 
net sales net sales were  million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal net sales include million and million from elder beerman operations for fiscal and for the period from october  through january   respectively 
comparable store sales  which exclude the impact of elder beerman  increased in fiscal merchandise departments recording comparable store sales increases were home  misses sportswear included in women s apparel  footwear  accessories  and cosmetics 
home sales significantly increased because of the opening of five furniture galleries in fiscal and adopting elder beerman s practice of item intensification 
increased sales in misses sportswear reflect a positive customer response to improved fashion offerings 
footwear sales increased as customers responded favorably to an open selling layout in the stores  which was initiated in fiscal and finalized in fiscal the accessories sales increase was driven by growth in the company s private label costume jewelry and cold weather fashion items 
cosmetics benefited from the new product launch of the anti aging cream strivectin 
merchandise categories reflecting the sharpest declines were juniors apparel  children s apparel  men s apparel  and dresses  petites and coats included in women s apparel

on a pro forma combined basis  bon ton and elder beerman comparable store sales for fiscal decreased 
other income other income  which contains net income from leased departments and other customer revenues  increased million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to the impact of elder beerman leased departments and expanded furniture operations 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to the addition of elder beerman operations 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  an increase of percentage point from in fiscal the increase in gross margin rate primarily reflects an increased markup rate 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal this increase was largely due to an additional million from elder beerman operations 
increases in integration expenses  advertising expenses  accounts receivable facility expenses  store closing expenses and a prior year gain on the sale of the harrisburg distribution center were partially offset by a decrease in store payroll expenses and an increase in securitization income 
depreciation and amortization increased million  to million  in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase principally reflects the impact of elder beerman depreciation and amortization of million  asset impairment charges on long lived assets of certain stores of million and a million cumulative charge pursuant to a review of bon ton s historical lease accounting 
in fiscal  bon ton recorded a charge of million for the write off of duplicate information systems software due to the acquisition of elder beerman

income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal net income net income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes material measures of bon ton s liquidity and capital resources january  january  january  dollars in millions working capital current ratio debt to total capitalization debt plus equity unused availability under lines of credit subject to the minimum borrowing availability covenant of for the period of july  through january   bon ton s primary sources of working capital were cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
through july   bon ton s primary sources of working capital also included proceeds from the accounts receivable facility 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories prior to the holiday season 
decreases in working capital  current ratio and debt to total capitalization and the increase in unused availability under lines of credit for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  are principally because of the credit card sale and associated debt reduction 
increases in working capital and the current ratio for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  principally reflect an increase in merchandise inventories 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects net proceeds from the credit card sale and decreases in merchandise inventories and retained interest in trade receivables

additionally  the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable may  to shareholders of record as of april  our board of directors will consider dividends in subsequent periods as it deems appropriate 
bon ton s capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
company capital expenditures for fiscal are planned at approximately million 
we anticipate our cash flows from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our notes  new senior secured credit facility and new mortgage loan facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by us  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry 
a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business 
we have not identified any probable circumstances that would likely impair our ability to meet our cash requirements or trigger a default or acceleration of payment of our debt 
contractual obligations and commitments the following tables reflect bon ton s contractual obligations and commitments as of january  contractual obligations payment due by period dollars in thousands total within year years years after years long term debt capital leases building maintenance operating leases totals excludes interest under long term debt obligations where such interest is calculated on a variable basis

in the ordinary course of business  bon ton entered into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise up to twelve months in advance of expected delivery 
these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to termination of the receivables securitization program on july   bon ton engaged in securitization activities involving its proprietary credit card portfolio as a source of funding 
off balance sheet proprietary credit card securitizations provided a significant portion of bon ton s funding and was one of its primary sources of liquidity 
at january   off balance sheet securitized receivables represented of bon ton s funding sum of securitized receivables and balance sheet debt 
gains and losses from securitizations were recognized in bon ton s consolidated statements of operations when it relinquished control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 ac counting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depended in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
based on the term of the securitization agreement less than one year and the fact that the credit card receivables that comprised the retained interests were short term in nature  bon ton classified retained interests as a current asset 
bon ton sold undivided percentage ownership interests in certain of its credit card accounts receivable to unrelated third parties under a million accounts receivable securitization facility 
the unrelated third parties  referred to as the conduit  purchased a million interest in the accounts receivable under this facility at january  bon ton was responsible for servicing these accounts  retained a servicing fee and bore the risk of non collection limited to its retained interests in the accounts receivable 
associated off balance sheet assets and related debt were million at january  based upon the terms of the accounts receivable facility  the accounts receivable transactions qualified for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment required bon ton to account for transactions with the conduit as a sale of accounts receivable instead of reflecting the conduit s net investment as long term debt with a pledge of accounts receivable as collateral 
absent this sale treatment  bon ton s balance sheet would have reflected additional accounts receivable and debt 
critical accounting policies bon ton s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required bon ton to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  bon ton evaluated its estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  contingencies and litigation 
bon ton based its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that were believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which formed the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies for bon ton are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  inventories were stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method using a last in  first out lifo cost basis 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions over a period of time that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
bon ton believes that the retail inventory method it used provided an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
bon ton regularly reviewed inventory quantities on hand and recorded an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case bon ton may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if bon ton s inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  bon ton would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  bon ton may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within bon ton s markets could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  bon ton s lifo calculations have yielded inventory increases in recent years due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
this is the result of the lifo method whereby merchandise sold is valued at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicate to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  bon ton reduced the carrying value of its lifo inventories to a net realizable value nrv 
these reductions totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
inherent in these nrv assessments are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  bon ton may have overstated or understated its inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are reflected as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs 
advertising allowances received from each vendor are reviewed to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising costs incurred to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized as a reduction of the related advertising costs that have been incurred and reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items eg  allowance for doubtful accounts for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
bon ton must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and  to the extent it does not believe recovery of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of income 
bon ton s net deferred tax assets were million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  bon ton considered whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  or a portion thereof  will not be realized 
bon ton considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code section 
as a result  bon ton concluded that a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
a total valuation allowance of million and million was recorded at january  and january   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on the considerations above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets acquired in connection with the october  acquisition of elder beerman were reduced by million 
of this decrease  million reduced the income tax provision and million reduced the january  net book value of intangible assets and related deferred tax liability at january  acquired in connection with the elder beerman acquisition 
as of january   bon ton had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  subject to certain limitations imposed by section these net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal through fiscal as of january   bon ton had alternative minimum tax credits and general business credits in the amount of million and million  respectively 
both credits are subject to the limitations imposed by section the alternative minimum tax credits are available indefinitely  and the general business credits expire in fiscal and fiscal bon ton acquired these alternative minimum tax credits and general business credits in connection with the acquisition of elder beerman 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in bon ton s business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from its estimates 
in cases where bon ton determined that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  it depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
bon ton s net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at january  and january   respectively 
bon ton assessed  on a store by store basis  the impairment of identifiable long lived assets primarily property  fixtures and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of bon ton s use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires bon ton to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect bon ton s best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent bon ton s best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions  if available 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
bon ton evaluated the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  no impairment loss was recorded in fiscal  and impairment losses of million and million were recorded in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal and  respectively 
included in the impairment loss in fiscal is million related to the write down of an intangible asset at one store location 
in fiscal  bon ton recorded a charge of million in depreciation and amortization expense for the write off of duplicate information systems software due to the acquisition of elder beerman 
this charge arose because of the decision to use elder beerman s point of sale system in all of bon ton s stores 
goodwill and intangible assets bon ton s goodwill was million at january  and january  bon ton s intangible assets are principally comprised of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases acquired in store acquisitions completed in fiscal years through  which were adjusted to reflect fair market value 
these lease related interests are being amortized on a straight line method 
at january   these lease related interests had average remaining lives of eighteen years for amortization purposes 
the january  net book value of certain lease related interests and trademarks  totaling million  acquired in connection with the october acquisition of elder beerman was written off in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to adjustments to deferred tax asset valuation allowances recorded in connection with the elder beerman acquisition 
bon ton s net intangible assets totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis methodology  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of acquired businesses 
bon ton s policy was to conduct impairment testing based on its most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
if actual results prove inconsistent with bon ton s assumptions and judgments  bon ton could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
bon ton completed a review of the carrying value of goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 at january  and determined that goodwill was not impaired

the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the full impact of sfas no 
r adoption cannot be predicted at this time as it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had bon ton adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share within note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires that tax benefits from compensation deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
bon ton is unable to estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
on april   the securities and exchange commission announced a delay of the required implementation timing of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate facilities  bon ton entered into a derivative financial transaction in the form of an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap was used to hedge a portion of the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swap was a qualifying hedge and the interest rate differential was reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap 
at january   bon ton held a variable to fixed rate swap with a notional amount of million with one financial institution 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during fiscal and  bon ton did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about bon ton s derivative financial instrument and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and an interest rate swap 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at january  for the interest rate swap  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for bon ton s quarterly results for fiscal and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each fiscal year 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
bon ton does not believe inflation had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflationary adjustments in the future
