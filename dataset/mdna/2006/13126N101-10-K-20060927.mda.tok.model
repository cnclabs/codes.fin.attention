overview in  we worked to realign our business focus to take advantage of two important trends in the telecommunication industry the convergence of landline  mobile  and internet communications 
the acceleration in the adoption of the on demand delivery model 
these trends continued to drive the need among service providers for flexible  faster to market  network independent software applications to compete against competitive threats 
in response  we moved to complement our direct to consumer business model with an on demand application model to provide communication 
table of contents solutions that require minimal allocation of capital and allow service providers to quickly react to customer needs and adapt to the dynamically shifting competitive landscape 
we provide application services on a subscription basis that add features and enhanced functionality to the telecommunications services used by mainstream consumers and small and home offices 
our software based services are delivered by our desktop phone companion software pcs through our proprietary enhanced services platform  which allows subscribers to manage calls across existing landline  mobile and internet networks 
as of june   we had approximately  paying subscribers for these application services 
because our services improve the utilization of existing telecommunications services by our subscribers  we believe that our application services complement the efforts of landline  mobile and internet service providers to reduce their subscriber churn 
this has allowed us to establish cooperative relationships with network service providers 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  investments in minority owned companies  inventories  accounting for income taxes  loss contingencies  stock based compensation  and valuation of acquired intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
revenue recognition 
we earn revenues primarily from paid subscriber services and to a lesser extent  fees earned from local exchange carrier call termination access charges and the offering of third party products and services to our subscribers 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which clarifies certain existing accounting principles for the timing of revenue recognition and classification of revenues in the financial statements 
we recognize revenue beginning when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our subscriber revenues consist mainly of monthly recurring subscription fees 
we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription period when the sab criteria are met 
in addition to the direct relationship that we have with the majority of our paid subscribers  we also have indirect relationship agreements with internet service providers isps and other companies whereby those companies customers are offered a co branded subscription service 
when the agreement provides that we are the party responsible for providing the service  have control over the fees charged to customers and bear the credit risk  we record the gross amount billed as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
when the agreement provides that we receive a net payment from our co branding partners based upon the number of their customers registered for our services  we record the net amount received as revenue in accordance with eitf 
table of contents in the third quarter of fiscal  we purchased prepaid phones and phone cards with the intention of reselling them with a day free trial of our application based services and entered into an agreement to sell the prepaid phones and a portion of the phone cards to a distributor 
revenue from the sale of prepaid phones and phone cards is recognized when the sab criteria are met 
we recognize sales to distributors on a sell through basis and when the cash is collected from the distributor and have recognized  and  of revenue related to the sales to this distributor in the years ended june  and these transactions contain multiple elements  including the phone  the minutes  and our callwave service  to which we have applied eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the various elements of the arrangement are separable and each element is recognized separately in accordance with sab in accounting for multiple deliverables  management s judgment is necessary when identifying the nature of deliverables in an arrangement as well as measuring and allocating fair value to the multiple deliverables 
this program was cancelled in the second quarter of fiscal and remaining inventories of approximately  were completely written off to expense 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience with bad debts 
we periodically review and evaluate bad debt reserves held by the local telephone companies and the third party that manages our billing relationship with the telephone companies 
judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  as of june  and  as of june  our allowance for doubtful accounts is correlated with our aggregate billings through the local telephone companies 
the increase in the allowance is related to higher than expected carrier reject rates during the first half of fiscal this trend is not expected to continue 
investments in minority owned companies we account for investments in minority interests of other companies over which we do not exercise significant influence on the cost method in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under the cost method  an investment is carried at cost until it is sold or there is evidence that changes in the business environment or other facts and circumstances suggest it may be other than temporarily impaired 
at september   we determined that our investment in a minority owned company was other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  to reduce the investment to a net realizable value of callwave has no other investments of this nature 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
for the year ended june   we recorded an impairment against inventory in the amount of  to reduce the inventory balance to its expected net realizable value of zero 
management s judgment is required in determining net realizable value and the extent of any impairment to our inventory 
judgment is also required in determining the collectability of amounts that are due from our distributors as a result of selling our inventory through to end customers 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
at june   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
due to the uncertainty of realizing these net deferred tax assets  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these net deferred tax assets 
such uncertainty primarily relates to the potential for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits which begin to expire in and  respectively  to be realized against future taxable income 
in addition  pursuant 
table of contents to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of these assets 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provision of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing model and a single option award approach 
the fair value is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected term 
we compute expected volatility based on a combination of both historical volatility and market based implied volatility  as we believe that the combination provides a more accurate estimate of future volatility 
the expected term represents the period of time that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards 
due to the inherent uncertainty in valuing awards for publicly traded stock as of the grant date  given that such awards will be exercised  purchased or sold at indeterminate future dates  the actual value realized by the recipients  if any  may vary significantly from the value of the awards estimated by us at the grant date 
valuation of acquired intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of license agreements 
these license agreements give us the right to practice and use certain technologies in the fax  voice and internet telephony space 
these assets are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires us to record these assets at their fair value 
historically  we have used the cash purchase price at the time of acquisition as the best indicator of fair value 
sfas also requires us to periodically evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets to determine if an impairment loss should be recorded under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in accordance with statement  an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
sfas no 
outlines the factors which individually or in combination could trigger an impairment review as follows a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group 
table of contents a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our business

results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
subscription revenues were million in fiscal  representing of revenues  compared to million in fiscal  representing of revenues  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in our revenues in fiscal was attributable primarily to a decrease in the number of paying subscribers from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  the decrease in subscribers is driven primarily from the migration of dial up users to broad band 
in addition  our average revenue per user arpu decreased during fiscal as we have a higher percentage of our subscribers from our indirect channel distribution agreements 
we record revenue from our indirect channel partners on a gross or net basis depending on the facts of the agreement 
revenues from our indirect channel partners in fiscal year were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for the same period last year 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
gross margins decreased to for the year ended june  from 
table of contents at june  the decrease in our gross margin is driven by increased wireline telecom costs to reserve phone numbers in preparation for our service platform rolling out with local exchange carriers  mobil operators and web portals 
wireline costs have also increased with the rollout of our new service platform which allows subscribers to screen  forward and transfer calls to mobile  landline or voip based phones 
these services generate increased minutes and numbers of calls compared to our traditional direct to consumer programs 
finally  cost of sales was negatively impacted by the discontinuation of our prepaid mobile phone program  the write off of the associated costs of  and the ongoing costs to support the limited users remaining on this service 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses primarily relates to a million reduction in direct customer acquisition  advertising and promotional expenses as we migrate a greater percentage of our business toward indirect channel partnerships with landline and mobile operators and continue to strategically invest in the direct channel 
this expense reduction is partially offset with increased customer support expenses of approximately million 
the focus of our call center has shifted from technical support to landline customer retention and mobile sales and the related costs are now charged to sales and marketing 
previously  the call center performed a technical support role and its expenses were allocated across all three operating expense categories 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to the shift in costs of the call center to sales and marketing which reduced research and development costs by million 
we believe it is essential to have a strong research and development team as we develop new products in the direct channel and migrate our business toward indirect channel partnerships with landline  mobile carriers and web portals  and continue to strategically invest in the direct channel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increased legal fees of million relating to ongoing litigation and higher bad debt expense of million associated with increased local exchange carrier reject fees 
other contributing factors were increased consulting expenses of million relating to indirect channel partnerships and increased facilities expenses of million associated with the consolidation of our facilities in california 
impairment loss 
during the fiscal year ended june   we determined  based on an analysis of future cash flows  that our investment in and receivable from a company in which we had a minority interest was other than temporarily impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  income tax provision 
we recognized an income tax provision for the twelve months ended june  and an income tax benefit for the same period last year of million and million  respectively 
in prior periods we have recognized a tax benefit related to the reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets 
total deferred tax assets amount to million and have been fully offset by a valuation allowance reflecting the fact that we have not determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to use our deferred tax assets to offset income taxes payable as we currently project eight quarters of losses due to investing in the indirect channel 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets and will adjust the balance accordingly 
net income loss 
the net loss was million for the year ended june   compared to net income of million for the same period last year  a decrease of million or 
this decrease in net income was primarily the result of reduced revenues as we shift our focus toward indirect partnerships  an increase in cost of sales related to our entry into the mobile phone market and preparing our company for the shift into the 
table of contents indirect channel  increased general and administrative expenses related to increased litigation and bad debt charges and a tax provision of million recorded during  an increase of million over the same period in during  our revenues decreased by million  cost of sales increased 
million  operating expenses increased by million and interest income increased million 
our net profit loss margin was for the fiscal year ending june  compared to for the same period last year 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
subscription revenues were million in fiscal  representing of revenues  compared to million in fiscal  also representing of revenues  an increase of million  or 
the increase in our revenues in fiscal was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of paying subscribers from approximately  at june  to approximately  at june  revenue also increased due to our launch of the callwave for mobile service in the fourth quarter of which resulted in revenue of  these increases were partially offset by decreases in advertising revenue and termination access fees 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in our cost of sales in fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in our paying subscriber base 
cost of sales also increased by the cost of mobile phones  prepaid minutes and phone cards as we launched our mobile service 
the phones are being subsidized so that we can gain entrance into the mobile market 
gross margins increased slightly to for the year ended june  from at june  sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in spending on media channels for fiscal  increased staffing costs of million and increased public relations spend of million now that we are a public company 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased staffing costs of million and an increase in legal fees related to patent prosecution of million 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in accounting fees of million  insurance costs of million  legal fees of million and staffing costs of million 
these increased expenses reflect the additional costs of being a public company 
bad debt expense also increased by million reflecting increased revenues 
income tax benefit 
we recognized an income tax benefit for fiscal of million as we determined it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in fiscal years and these deferred tax assets were fully reserved prior to march  in order to realize the benefit of our recorded deferred tax asset for million  we will need to generate taxable income for federal and california purposes of million 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
net income 
net income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
although revenue increased  operating expenses increased resulting in 
table of contents a decrease to operating income of million 
this decrease to operating income was mostly offset by an increase in interest income from  in fiscal to million in fiscal and an increase in the tax benefit recognized from million in fiscal to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million and accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
in prior years we received net proceeds from issuances of preferred stock totaling approximately million and proceeds from the public offering of our common stock totaling approximately million  net of underwriting and offering costs 
since our initial public offering our working capital and capital expense requirements have been funded with cash flow provided from operations 
we believe our current cash reserves are adequate to cover the anticipated losses over the next few years as we migrate our business towards the indirect channels while continuing to strategically invest in our direct to consumer channel 
we are currently projecting a net loss of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  we do not expect to return to profitability until the first half of fiscal cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily due to cash generated by operations of million and exercise of options and warrants of million  partially offset by purchases of property  equipment  and intangibles of million 
we expect that our cash on hand at june   along with cash generated from operations  will be adequate to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we reexamine our cash requirements periodically in light of changes in our business 
for the year ended june   we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately million 
net accounts receivable decreased to million at june  from million at june  this decrease is due primarily to the reduction in sales in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
franchise tax board audit in may  we were notified by the california franchise tax board that our research and development credits for the taxable year ended june   would be under examination 
as of the date of this filing  the exam is in the preliminary stage 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of june  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total 
table of contents purchase obligations consist primarily of contracts with communications services providers totaling  and contractual obligations to pay  to providers of billing and collection services and outsourced customer support due in less than one year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not currently do any business denominated in foreign currencies and  therefore  are not subject to any significant foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and marketable securities totaling million at june   and cash and cash equivalents totaling million and marketable securities totaling million at june  cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes in depository accounts at fdic regulated banking institutions 
marketable securities consist of investment grade securities including auction rate securities  which carry interest or dividend rates that reset every seven to days  corporate bonds  and government and agency securities 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to our ability to liquidate these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce our future interest income 
risks related to our business our ability to successfully generate increased revenues and profits will be dependent upon our success in entering into and successfully managing indirect distribution relationships 
we grew our business by directly marketing our services to consumers and small businesses through internet advertising 
we intend to attempt to grow our business by promoting our services to users through indirect distribution arrangements in which we enter into distribution agreements with telecommunications service providers  which agree to distribute our services to their subscribers 
we do not have significant experience in developing and managing those indirect relationships 
there typically is a long lead time required to conclude agreements for such arrangements  additional time is thereafter required to implement each agreed upon arrangement  and the actual pace of implementation is dependent upon cooperation and support from the companies with which we enter into those arrangements 
in addition  even if we are able to put such indirect distribution relationships in place  the extent to which the service provider s customers subscribe for our services will be dependent in substantial part upon the pace and manner in which the service provider implements and promotes our services  which are outside of our control 
if we are unable to successfully implement those indirect distribution relationships we may not realize substantial growth in our subscribers for our services  we will not realize substantial growth in revenues or profitability  and our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we may suffer losses from operations and reduce our accumulated cash reserves as we shift resources from our profitable direct distribution business and focus our business and investments on indirect distribution of our services 
we have elected to reduce the amount of resources that we are devoting to our legacy business in which we had marketed and distributed our services directly to users  and instead to expand the resources that we are investing in the development and marketing of our services through indirect distribution arrangements 
as a result  we expect to realize lower revenues from our legacy business 
however  we do not expect to begin generating substantial revenues from indirect distribution arrangements for at least several quarters 
that delay in generating substantial revenues is attributable to a number of factors  including the time period required to develop indirect distribution relationships with telecommunications carriers  the time required to implement technological changes to our services in order to make them compatible with the communications infrastructure 
table of contents of carriers with which we enter into indirect distribution relationships  and the time required to successfully market our services to those carriers customers and persuade those customers to subscribe for our services 
as we undergo this transition from a business based upon our traditional landline services sold directly to the consumer  to one based primarily upon the delivery of services through indirect distribution relationships  we are likely to realize losses from operations and reduce our accumulated cash reserves 
our ability to successfully implement indirect distribution arrangements is dependent upon our ability to integrate our technology with that of the companies that distribute our services 
in order for our indirect distribution arrangements to be successful  the companies with whom we enter into indirect distribution arrangements must be able to integrate our services with their own service offerings 
that integration process requires that our technology operate effectively with the service platforms from which those companies deliver telecommunications services to their customers and meet the technical specifications and operating parameters imposed by companies with which we are seeking indirect distribution relationships 
the integration of our services with the service platform of those other companies is a complex process that requires not only that our respective technology platforms operate together  but also that our engineering departments work effectively together at a technical level in integrating our respective services 
those tasks require time  and we may encounter technical difficulties that occasion delay 
we also may encounter some technical difficulties that adversely affect the customer s ability to fully utilize our services or even our ability to integrate our services at all 
if we are unable to overcome those challenges  then our indirect distribution strategy may be adversely affected  and we may not be able to achieve the revenue and profitability gains that we are seeking to achieve 
the use of indirect distribution arrangements may cause us to realize lower revenues and profitability than we traditionally have realized from direct distribution of our services 
we expect that the principal growth in subscribers will come primarily from the implementation of indirect distribution arrangements 
while these arrangements typically deliver subscribers to us at a lower subscriber acquisition cost than our traditional sources of subscribers  they also tend to generate a lower average revenue per user  or arpu  than the traditional direct sources of subscribers 
in order to achieve substantial future revenue growth from these indirect distribution arrangements  we will need to implement indirect distribution arrangements that afford us broad exposure to significant numbers of potential subscribers  and we will need the other parties to those arrangements to cooperate with us in distributing our services to their customers 
if we are unable to accomplish those objectives  then we may not achieve future revenue growth  and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
if telecommunications customers integrate their landline and mobile services at a rate that is slower than what we predict  then we may experience delays in realizing growth in revenues and profitability from our services 
our services allow users to integrate their landline telephone services with their other telecommunications services eg mobile 
we believe that there is an opportunity for the marketing and distribution of our services because of that integration  or convergence  of telecommunication services 
we therefore have decided to devote substantial resources to indirect marketing and distribution of our services 
if the pace of that convergence of landline and other telecommunications services unfolds more slowly than we currently foresee it occurring  then the proportion of mass market consumers who are ready to subscribe for our mobile services may be much smaller than is necessary to support substantial growth in our revenues and profitability 
if the proportion of consumers who subscribe for our services is correspondingly lower  then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 

table of contents because we are unable to predict with precision the rate at which we will acquire paying subscribers for our services through the indirect distribution relationships that we will be emphasizing  our results of operations may be correspondingly less predictable  our stock price therefore may be more volatile  and our stockholders may suffer losses 
from our legacy business  which involved the direct marketing and distribution of our services to customers  we have assembled a substantial amount of data that allowed us to predict our subscriber counts  revenues  and profits in that legacy business with some reliability 
as our business increasingly emphasizes the delivery of our services through indirect distribution relationships  however  we will be operating without historical data that would allow us to predict with any precision the rate at which our services will be accepted by consumers or the prices at which consumers may be willing to subscribe for those services 
consequently  we may experience significantly greater swings in our revenues and profitability than in the past  our stock price may become increasingly volatile  and our stockholders may realize losses in the value of their shares 
if network service providers elect to bundle services similar to ours that they obtain from other providers or to develop such services themselves as part of their product offering  we could lose many of our paid subscribers 
the market for communications and information services is competitive  and many service providers attempt to attract and retain subscribers by offering a variety of services 
while service providers that provide internet call waiting and call management services generally impose a separate charge  those service providers may in the future bundle such services with their other service offerings  thereby effectively offering these services for no incremental fee 
if we lose subscribers to those network service providers that bundle services that are competitive with ours and we are unable to find replacement subscribers willing to pay for our services  our business  revenues and profitability would be adversely affected 
increased marketing costs for internet advertising may cause further erosion in our traditional landline business 
our subscriber acquisition costs for our traditional land line customers are dependent largely upon our ability to purchase multiple types of advertising at a reasonable cost 
our advertising costs vary over time  depending upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as seasonality  the particular mix of advertising we use and the rate at which we convert potential subscribers into paid subscribers  and consolidation among companies that control advertising channels 
we have experienced an increase in subscriber acquisition costs in the recent periods 
given our belief that our revenues from our traditional landline business will decline over time  we have decided not to increase the amount of money that we spend on internet advertising for our landline services 
as a result  we are realizing both reduced marketing expenditures and a higher unit cost for the advertising services that we purchase 
we expect that those two factors will occasion an acceleration in the decline of our landline business over time 
we are dependent upon billing arrangements with regional telephone companies for collecting fees from many of our subscribers 
we currently collect the majority of our revenues through billing arrangements in which our subscribers regional telephone companies collect our service fees from our subscribers and forward those fees to us 
we collect the remainder of our revenues through our subscribers credit cards and checks 
if the telephone companies terminated those billing arrangements  or if the cost of those arrangements increased significantly  we may be unable to continue to collect a significant portion of our revenues in this manner  and instead would have to collect those revenues through use of subscribers credit cards  by having subscribers mail checks to us  or by other means 
because many subscribers prefer to pay for our services through their telephone bills  any need to rely upon alternative means to collect a significant portion of our revenues may lead to a loss of a substantial portion of the subscribers who currently pay for our services as part of their monthly bill from their telephone company  a decline in the rate at which we increase the number of our paid subscribers  or significant 
table of contents delinquencies in payments by our subscribers 
if we are not able to successfully manage and maintain these billing relationships  our bad debt reserves may increase and we may lose subscribers that prefer paying for our services on their local telephone bill 
customer billing is a highly complex process  and our billing system must efficiently interface with third party systems 
our ability to accurately and efficiently bill our subscribers is dependent on the successful operation of the third party systems upon which we rely and our ability to provide these third parties the information required to process transactions 
any failures or error in our current billing systems or procedures or resulting from any upgrades to our billing systems or procedures could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 
if we fail to maintain effective internal financial and managerial systems and procedures  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
as we expand our operations and offer new services  there is a risk that our systems and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations or ensure proper identification of and proper accounting treatment for our activities 
our failure to maintain and implement such adequate systems and procedures could adversely affect the information on which we base our decisions  thereby causing us to make inappropriate business decisions 
those incorrect decisions in turn  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operation 
we face competition from well capitalized hardware vendors  software vendors and service providers against whom we may not be able to successfully compete 
competition in the communications and information services industries is intense 
we face competition for our offerings from internet service providers  such as aol  landline and wireless telephone companies  such as at t  cable companies and other communications hardware  software and services vendors 
these companies are better capitalized  have greater name recognition and significantly larger existing subscriber bases than we do 
we may also face competition in the future from communications hardware and software companies that are currently focused on other markets 
if these or other companies provide services similar to ours  we may not be able to compete effectively  which would harm our results of operations and financial condition 
there are limited barriers to entry for other companies to provide services that compete with ours 
telecommunications services were historically provided by companies that made substantial capital investments in their networks 
the size of those investments and the time required to deploy those networks served as significant barriers to entry into such markets 
in contrast  we provide software based enhanced services that do not require substantial capital expenditures to deploy and maintain 
as a result  other companies with strong technical staffs and knowledge of the communications and information services industries could compete with us without facing significant capital expenditures or other barriers to entry 
as a result  we may face increasing competition from companies with significantly greater resources than we have  which may force us to reduce our prices and increase our operating expenses to remain competitive 
if we are not able to compete successfully with these companies  we may lose customers or fail to grow our business as we anticipate  either of which could harm our financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
we rely upon the networks of numerous long distance and local carriers to provide services to our subscribers 
if the cost of these services were to increase  we may not be able to profitably provide our services to our subscribers 
in providing services to our subscribers  we incur a number of underlying telecommunications costs which are beyond our control 
in order to deliver our services to our subscribers  our customers must subscribe to certain ancillary services from their telecommunications providers that re route certain telephone calls from our 
table of contents subscribers telephone lines to toll free numbers that we have leased at our software based switching facility  which facilitates the receipt of the call by the number that the subscribers designate 
our services rely in part upon the toll free long distance and local services that we purchase from network service providers 
the cost of these services  which we integrate into our service offerings  or which subscribers assume directly  is beyond our control and may increase for a number of reasons  including a general increase in wholesale long distance rates or charges for call forwarding services  an election by service providers to implement a new pricing structure on the services that we currently purchase  an election by third party service providers to impose charges for services which are currently toll free  and an increase in subscriber usage patterns that increases the cost of the services that we purchase 
our ability to offer services to our subscribers at competitive rates is partially dependent upon our ability to use that toll free telephone network and our subsidiary s ability to procure telephone network access and services on a reliable basis and at reasonable prices 
if we are unable to effectively manage the cost of our underlying network services  then our pricing structure with a significant number of our subscribers would increase  which could make it difficult to conduct business at attractive margins 
there are a limited number of long distance and interconnection service providers that are able to provide the services on which we rely 
we currently have contracts with four service providers for long distance services  and our wholly owned subsidiary  liberty telecom  llc also has interconnection agreements with other telecommunications companies  which together provide us with services that we integrate into our enhanced offerings 
each of those contracts may be terminated without cause by the service provider upon advance written notice 
the required notice period  in each instance  is less than the amount of time that we would likely need to negotiate a contract with a successor provider and modify our system to re route our subscribers inbound calls to that successor s network 
in addition  there are only a limited number of service providers with which we can contract to provide these services 
as a result  if one or more of the service providers from which we currently procure long distance or interconnection services were to terminate our existing contractual relationships  we may not be able to locate a substitute provider on a timely basis and upon reasonable terms  if at all  in order to avoid a disruption or loss of service to our subscribers 
if we are not able to purchase access to sufficient long distance and interconnection services at reasonable prices  we may not be able to profitably provide our services to our subscribers and our operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
we rely upon the internet and other networks controlled by third parties to provide our services and if we are not able to maintain access to these networks at reasonable rates  we may not be able to profitably provide our services 
we provide our services by integrating and enhancing underlying services on other companies networks that rely on the public switched telephone network  across the private networks constructed and owned by other companies such as those in the cable industry  and across the internet 
if the owners of any one or more of those networks were either to refuse to transport calls to our subscribers  or were to impose significantly higher charges for those calls  or if applicable regulations were to impose significantly higher charges for those calls  we would likely face increased operating costs  our profitability could suffer and our business could be harmed 
because a significant portion of our subscribers are price sensitive  we may not be able to increase the charges for our services without adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain paid subscribers 
our subscribers are generally price sensitive 
in response to that sensitivity  we have attempted to control our costs in order to be able to charge low subscription rates for our landline services  which generally range 
table of contents from to per month  and are as high as per month in limited circumstances 
we expect that recruiting new subscribers may become more expensive on average if we increase our marketing efforts 
if we experience significant cost increases or otherwise want to increase our margins  we may be unable to increase our monthly charges by an amount sufficient to allow us to maintain margins or our profitability  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the availability of reasonably priced call forwarding services to provide our services to the majority of our subscribers in a cost effective manner 
customers who subscribe to certain of our services typically subscribe to call forwarding services from their local telephone service provider 
generally  these call forwarding services are available to our subscribers at a reasonable price 
if the service providers do not provide these services at a reasonable price  the overall price of obtaining our services may exceed the amount that our current and potential subscribers are willing to pay 
if the prices for these services increase  a significant number of our subscribers may terminate their subscriptions for our services 
a catastrophic event at liberty telecom s telephone switching facilities would cause the disruption of our services to subscribers 
our enhanced services currently depend on telecommunications services from our subsidiary  liberty telecom  which are provided using call switching facilities in las vegas and reno  nevada 
a catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or a fire  that destroys part or all of the facilities would disrupt our business and prevent us from providing services to our subscribers for an extended period of time 
because our subscribers expect our services to match the high reliability that characterizes services in the communications and information services industries generally  any failure in our ability to service our subscribers could cause us to lose significant numbers of subscribers  and make it more difficult to obtain new paid subscribers 
a system failure or a breach of our network security could delay or interrupt service to our subscribers or lead to a misappropriation of our confidential information 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer network from interruption  unauthorized entry  computer viruses and other similar events 
our existing and planned precautions may not be adequate to prevent a significant interruption in the operation of our network 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure also may be vulnerable to computer viruses  hackers or similar disruptive problems caused by our subscribers  employees or other internet users who attempt to invade public and private data networks 
a system failure or a breach of our security measures may lead to a disruption in service  or the misappropriation of confidential information  which may result in significant liability to us and also may deter current and potential subscribers from using our services 
any system failure or security breach that causes interruptions or data loss in our operations or in the computer systems of our subscribers could cause us to lose paid subscribers and harm our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches that could harm our business 
currently  a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information  including customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect transaction data 
any compromise of our security could harm our reputation and  therefore  our business  and also subject us to significant liability 
in addition  a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  or cause interruptions in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 

table of contents if we experience excessive fraudulent credit card charges  we could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment and our subscriber base could decrease significantly 
a significant number of our paid subscribers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all service fees charged by us 
we incur losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction to purchase our service 
if the numbers of unauthorized credit card transactions becomes excessive  we could be assessed substantial fines for excess charge backs  or we could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment 
if we were unable to accept credit cards  our paid subscriber base could significantly decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
if we do not successfully anticipate the service demands of our subscribers  we may be unable to successfully attract and retain subscribers 
we must accurately forecast the features and functionality required by our current and potential subscribers 
in addition  we must design and implement service enhancements that meet subscriber requirements in a timely and efficient manner 
we may not successfully determine subscriber requirements and  therefore  may not be able to satisfy subscriber demands 
furthermore  as our current subscribers needs change  we may not be able to identify  design and implement in a timely and efficient manner services incorporating the type and level of features desired by our subscribers 
if we fail to accurately determine or effectively market subscriber feature requirements or service enhancements  we may lose current subscribers or fail to attract new subscribers  and may be unable to grow our revenues 
other persons may assert claims that our business operations or technology infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights  which could increase our costs of operation and distract management and could result in expensive settlement costs 
other companies or individuals  including our competitors  may claim that we infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties have contacted us  asserting that we may infringe their intellectual property rights 
for example  in december and april  a major communications infrastructure company delivered two letters to one of our distributors  in which we were not named  offering to negotiate with our distributor a nonexclusive license to certain patents that the infrastructure company believed to be relevant to our service and implying that our service may infringe those patents 
as part of this process  we have received a legal opinion from our intellectual property counsel that our services do not infringe the patents of this infrastructure company  although there is no assurance that a court would agree with that opinion 
on july   catch curve  inc  a delaware corporation  or catch curve  a wholly owned subsidiary of j global communications  inc  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the central district of california action no 
cv  or the action  alleging that the company s operations infringe us patent no 
 us patent no 
 us patent no 
 and us patent no 
 management does not believe that callwave s present operations infringe the asserted patents or that the asserted patents are valid or enforceable and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
trial is set for october on august   j global communications  inc  or j  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the central district of california action no 
cv  or the action  alleging that our operations infringe us patent no 
 and later amended its complaint to allege that our operations infringe us patents nos 
  and  two of the patents at issue in this case are being re examined by the pto 
on january   the court stayed the action until resolution of the re examinations before the pto 
management does not believe that callwave s present operations infringe the asserted patents or that the asserted patents are valid or enforceable and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
management expects the court to set a trial date once the re examination proceedings have concluded 

table of contents in september  we received a letter from america online  inc  in which aol offered to grant to us a license to us patent no 
 or the patent 
we and aol are engaged in business discussions at the present time  and it is unclear how those negotiations will be concluded 
management does not believe that callwave s present operations infringe the asserted patents 
by reason thereof  we presently do not believe it is probable that we will suffer a material loss by reason of this matter 
in october  we received a letter from counsel to web telephony  llc  or web telephony  implying that our operations infringe certain claims in us patent no 
 internet controlled telephone system  or the patent  and us patent no 
 internet controlled telephone system  or the patent 
on january   we filed in the united states district court for the central district of california an action for declaratory relief  in which we sought to have the court declare that we did not infringe the patent or the patent 
web telephony subsequently counterclaimed  alleging infringement of the and patents 
effective march   callwave and web telephony executed a definitive settlement agreement under which the parties waived all claims against each other with respect to the and the patents  and web telephony granted to callwave a worldwide  fully paid up  nonexclusive license entitling us to practice the claims of the and the patents 
the parties  by stipulation  subsequently dismissed the litigation 
a determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party  including in any of the above referenced matters  could expose us to substantial damages  restrict our operations or require us to procure costly licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims 
such a license may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
any effort to defend ourselves from assertions of infringement or misappropriation of a third party s intellectual property rights  whether or not we are successful  would be expensive and time consuming and would divert management resources 
any adverse determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a third party  or the costs we incur to defend ourselves against such claims  whether or not we are successful  would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our customers or other companies with whom we have a commercial relationship could also become the target of litigation relating to the patent and other intellectual property rights of others 
this could trigger support and indemnification obligations  which could result in substantial expenses  including the payment by us of costs and damages relating to patent infringement 
in addition to the time and expense required for us to meet our support and indemnification obligations  any such litigation could hurt our relations with our customers and other companies 
thus  the sale of our services could decrease 
claims for indemnification may be made by third parties with whom we do business and such claims may harm our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention 
from time to time  we may be subject to litigation  such as class action lawsuits  that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position 
such disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses  could occupy a significant amount of our management s time and attention  and could negatively affect our business operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  which could impair our ability to compete and reduce the value of our services 
we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright and patent law protections  and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
those measures may not provide meaningful protection 
for example  any rights granted under any of our existing or future patents may not provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
such patents could be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings 
the failure of any 
table of contents patents to adequately protect our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar services 
with respect to our proprietary rights  it may be possible for third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or marks without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
monitoring unauthorized use of our proprietary technology or marks is difficult and costly 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of  or to take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if we commence an action to terminate a third party s authorized use of our intellectual property rights  we may face challenges to the validity and enforceability of our proprietary rights and may not prevail in any litigation regarding those rights 
any efforts to enforce or determine the scope of our intellectual property rights  whether initiated by us or a third party  would be expensive and time consuming  would divert management resources and could adversely affect our business  whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional telephone numbers  we may not be able to grow our subscriber base 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to procure sufficient quantities of telephone numbers in area codes where our subscribers are located at costs we can afford 
the ability of telecommunications carriers to provide us with telephone numbers to be used in conjunction with our services depends on applicable regulations  the practices of telecommunications carriers that provide telephone numbers  and the level of demand for new telephone numbers 
in addition  the federal communications commission  or fcc  has regulations concerning numbering resource utilization 
if callwave does not sufficiently utilize the numbers assigned to it  it may have to relinquish control of those unused numbers 
furthermore  the fcc and state public utility commissions periodically review numbering utilization  and may in the future propose additional changes to regulations governing number assignment and availability 
failure to have access to telephone numbers in a timely and cost effective manner  or the loss of use of numbers we have accessed or may access  could prevent us from entering some markets or slow our growth in the markets in which we currently sell our services 
our enhanced services platform is a complex hardware and software system that could fail and cause service interruptions to our subscribers 
our hardware and software systems are complex and are critical to our business 
if our systems fail  our subscribers or our indirect distribution partners subscribers might experience reduced levels of service or service interruptions 
software based services  such as ours  may contain undetected errors or failures when introduced or when new versions are released 
errors may be found in our software before or after commercial release  and  as a result  we may experience development delays or a disruption of our services 
failures in our system or interruptions to our service could cause us or our indirect distribution partners to lose paid subscribers and harm our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain access to national ip protocol based networks  then our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
historically  to obtain our services  our subscribers had their calls routed on long distance circuits through the public switched telephone network to our software switching facilities in nevada 
that structure requires that we often pay for long distance telephone service 
we expect to increasingly rely upon the public internet or third party managed internet protocol networks  which would not change how we provision services to our subscribers  but would allow us to reduce our cost of sales by using more of the less expensive internet and local telephone network minutes and fewer of the more expensive long distance telephone network minutes 
we recently entered into a contract with a provider of these internet and managed internet protocol network services  which is a privately managed internet where access is controlled to ensure quality of service 
if we are unable to establish and effectively manage such relationships on a cost effective basis  or if the costs associated with internet and local telephone network minutes increase  then our ability to manage our costs may be adversely affected and our results of operations may suffer 

table of contents our success depends in large part upon our retention of our executive officers and our ability to hire and retain additional key personnel 
our future performance depends in large part upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key technical  operations and management personnel 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  operations and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key employees or attract or retain other highly qualified technical  operations and management personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could harm our business and prospects 
we may need to raise additional capital to support the growth of our operations  but such additional funds may not be available 
our future capital needs are difficult to predict 
we may require additional capital in order to take advantage of opportunities  including strategic alliances and potential acquisitions  or to respond to changing business conditions and unanticipated competitive pressures 
additionally  funds generated from our operations may be less than anticipated 
as of june   we had total working capital of million  million of cash and cash equivalents and million of marketable securities 
for the months ending june   we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately million 
while we believe that our current capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations through the end of june   we may need to raise additional funds either by borrowing money or issuing additional equity in order to handle unforeseen contingencies or take advantage of new opportunities 
we may not be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds  then we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities or take other actions that otherwise might be important to our business or prospects 
if we acquire other businesses or license technologies  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
our business strategy in the future may include the acquisition of other businesses or licensing of technologies 
we may not be able to identify  negotiate  integrate or finance any such future acquisition or license successfully 
we have not acquired any companies to date and have no arrangements or agreements with respect to any potential acquisition and  therefore  have no experience with integrating other business operations or technologies with ours 
if we engage in any such strategic transaction  then we may encounter unforeseen operating challenges and expenses that may require a significant amount of management time that otherwise would be devoted to running our operations 
if we undertake acquisitions or other strategic transactions  then we may issue shares of stock that dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and we may incur debt  assume contingent liabilities  or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets  any one or more of which may harm our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to risks and increased expense from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal controls 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of the act requires our management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting beginning with the fiscal year ended june  in addition  the act requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
in fiscal year and we expect to incur significant expense and to devote significant management resources to comply with section in the event that we or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section for fiscal year or any subsequent period  or we are unable to remediate any potential material weaknesses is our internal controls  investor perceptions of our company may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock  and we could experience further increases in expenses and redirection of management resources in order to remedy any such weakness in internal controls 

table of contents risks related to our industry we may not be able to respond to the rapid technological change of the communications and information services industries and  as a result  our business may be adversely affected 
the communications and information services industries are undergoing rapid and significant technological change 
we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business 
we expect that new services and technologies will emerge in the markets in which we compete 
those new services and technologies may be superior to the services and technologies that we provide or those new services may render our services and technologies obsolete 
in addition  those services and technologies may not be compatible with ours 
if we are not able to effectively respond to technological changes  the services we provide may no longer be attractive to our current and potential subscribers and our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
we may be required to incur significant costs to modify our systems in order to meet the requirements of the communications assistance to law enforcement act 
the communications assistance to law enforcement act  or calea  requires telecommunications carriers to have the capability to perform wiretaps and to record other call identifying information 
there is substantial uncertainty within the industry as to how to implement these requirements with respect to packet switched networks  such as that operated by liberty telecom 
as liberty telecom expands its service offerings  further modifications to its local switching equipment may be necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
on september   the fcc released an order concluding that calea applies to facilities based broadband internet access providers and providers of interconnected voip service 
the fcc has requested comment on  among other things  whether calea should apply to other types of ip enabled services 
that proceeding could result in additional regulatory burdens for us and for liberty telecom 
complying with calea and rules implementing calea may require us to incur substantial costs  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
our services may become subject to burdensome regulations that could increase our costs or restrict our service offerings 
we provide our services through data transmissions over public telephone lines and other facilities provided by telecommunications companies 
the underlying transmissions are typically subject to regulation by the fcc  state public utility commissions and  in the future  could become subject to regulation by foreign governmental authorities 
these regulations affect the prices that we pay for transmission services  the competition we face from communications service providers that may choose to offer enhanced services similar to ours and other aspects of our market 
as a software based provider of enhanced services  we believe we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the fcc or generally by state public utility commissions  although our wholly owned subsidiary  liberty telecom  is a telecommunications carrier subject to state and federal regulation as a competitive local exchange carrier 
as communications services increasingly are delivered over the internet and as we expand the services that we offer  our business may become increasingly regulated 
liberty telecom is required to have a certificate of public convenience and necessity in order to operate in the state of nevada as a competitive local exchange carrier 
if liberty telecom were to lose its certificate  we may not be able to obtain access to telecommunications services at rates or on other terms and conditions that are as favorable as those that we currently have 
as we introduce new offerings  it is possible that some of them may fall within existing telecommunications regulations  increasing our costs 
changes in the federal and state regulatory rules  or developments in the interpretation of existing regulations  could decrease our revenue  increase our costs or restrict our service offerings 
our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes 
the application of indirect taxes  such as sales and use tax  to e commerce businesses such as callwave and our users is a complex and evolving issue 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these 
table of contents taxes were established before the growth of the internet and e commerce 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or e commerce 
in addition  some jurisdictions have implemented laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of e commerce and several other proposals have been made at the us federal  state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services through the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of e commerce  hamper our ability to retain and attract new customers and diminish our ability to derive financial benefit from our activities 
in december  the us federal government enacted legislation extending the moratorium on states and other local authorities imposing access or discriminatory taxes on the internet through november this moratorium does not prohibit federal  state  or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules 
the application of existing  new  or future laws could have adverse effects on our business  prospects  and operating results 
there have been  and will continue to be  substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 
future legislation  regulation  or legal decisions affecting the internet  internet telephony or ip enabled services could restrict our business  prevent us from offering our services or increase our cost of doing business 
the fcc has not adopted a regulatory framework for ip enabled services or attempted generally or comprehensively to classify ip enabled services under the communications act of nonetheless  the fcc has begun imposing regulatory obligations upon interconnected voip services  including the obligation to offer enhanced service  to comply with the same calea requirements that apply to providers of telecommunications services  and to contribute to the universal service fund 
at this time  we do not provide any interconnected voip services  which the fcc has defined to include any voip services that enable real time  two way voice communications  require a broadband connection from the user s location  require ip compatible hardware  and permit users generally to receive calls that originate and terminate on the public switched telephone network 
apart from the regulatory obligations that apply to interconnected voip services  there are few laws  regulations or rulings that specifically address access to or commerce on the internet  including the provision of internet protocol based telephony and other ip enabled services 
we are unable to predict the impact  if any  that future legislation  regulations or legal decisions may have on our business 
however  the growth in the market for ip based telephony and other ip enabled communications  and the popularity of these services  along with other regulator objectives  such as ensuring adequate funding levels for the federal universal service fund create the risk that governments and agencies increasingly will seek to regulate services such as our current offerings 
many legislative and regulatory actions are underway or are being contemplated by federal and state authorities  including the fcc and various state regulatory agencies 
for example on march   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking docket and sought public comment regarding the regulatory classification  rights and obligations of services supported by ip technologies 
the fcc has yet to adopt a general regulatory framework for ip enabled services or address the majority of the issues raised in this proceeding 
on april   the fcc released a narrow declaratory ruling finding that certain internet protocol telephony services are telecommunications services upon which interstate access charges may be assessed 
prior to this decision  the fcc had never ruled that a service relying on internet protocol technology was a telecommunications service 
on june   the fcc released an order holding that menu driven prepaid calling cards  and prepaid calling cards that use ip transport to deliver all or a portion of the call embody telecommunications services  and these prepaid calling card providers qualify as telecommunications carriers that are subject to  among other things  universal service contributions based on their interstate revenues as well as intrastate and interstate access charges 
these rulings illustrate that certain internet protocol based services may become subject to costs and regulations that  previously  were not thought to be applicable 
neither of these rulings  however  are likely to have any direct effect on us in the near future 

table of contents november   the fcc released an order preempting the september  order of the minnesota public utilities commission minnesota order 
in the preempted minnesota order  the minnesota commission had asserted regulatory jurisdiction over vonage s digitalvoice service and ordered vonage to comply with all state statues and regulations relating to the offering of telephone service in minnesota  which could have required vonage  among other things  to obtain operating authority  file tariffs  and provide and fund emergency services 
in addition to preempting the minnesota order  the fcc concluded that comparable regulations of other states must likewise yield to important federal objectives  although the agency did not identify  or preempt  any specific state regulations or orders apart from the minnesota order 
specifically  the fcc explained that  to the extent that other voip services are not the same as vonage s but share similar basic characteristics  we believe it highly unlikely that the commission would fail to preempt state regulation of those services to the same extent 
the fcc  however  did not determine whether digitalvoice or any other ip enabled service is an information or telecommunications service  and thus the regulatory classification of these services under the act remains an open issue 
an appeal of the fcc s preemption order is currently pending 
moreover  the fcc has since clarified that no interconnected voip provider with the capability to track the jurisdictional confines of customer calls qualifies for the preemptive effects of the vonage order 
on june   the fcc ordered all providers of interconnected voip services to offer enhanced services as a condition of providing service  and to notify all consumers regarding the circumstances under which e may not be available or may be limited by comparison to traditional e service 
the fcc has requested comment on  among other topics  whether these requirements should be expanded or imposed upon other providers of ip enabled services 
on september   the fcc released an order reclassifying wireline broadband internet access services as information services  thereby placing wireline broadband internet access services within the same general regulatory framework as cable modem services 
as an information service  wireline broadband internet access  like cable modem service  no longer is subject to regulation under title ii of the communications act of  as amended  or the fcc s computer inquiry rules  but is subject to specific obligations imposed under title i of the act 
the decision could potentially enable ilecs to refuse to permit subscribers to their broadband transmission services to use our enhanced services  charge higher rates for underlying broadband transmission service to subscribers to our enhanced services  or bundle enhanced services that are similar to our enhanced services with their broadband transmission services at such a rate that it becomes economically unfeasible for us to compete with the ilec 
if one or more ilecs take any of those actions with explicit or tacit permission from the fcc  then it could have a material adverse impact upon our profitability and the results of our operations 
the interconnected voip services referenced above are offered to the public as substitutes for  or as substantially equivalent to  existing telecommunications services 
in contrast  the services that we currently offer are not offered to the public as substitutes for  or as substantially equivalent to  existing telecommunications services 
our ip enabled services allow our customers to manage calls which are initiated by third parties to our customers and completed over the local service facilities of our customers existing telecommunications service providers 
as such  our customers could not use our service unless they are also separately receiving telecommunications services from their own service provider 
certain decisions adopted by state commissions before the fcc issued its preemption order suggested an increased interest by some state commissions in regulating services that may be perceived as the functional equivalent of local phone service 
if state regulators attempt to regulate the enhanced services that we provide or determine that the enhanced services that we provide are currently subject to their regulatory provisions  then we may be faced with substantially increased regulatory burdens and costs 
regulatory proceedings  legislative efforts and adjudications  including but not limited to some of those described above  may lead to the imposition of additional regulatory obligations and requirements on us in the provision of our services  including but not limited to certification requirements  interstate or intrastate access 
table of contents charges  regulatory fees  payments to universal service support funds  taxes related to internet or ip enabled communications  requirements to provide free access to certain users  regulations based on encryption concerns  consumer protection requirements and certain minimum service levels 
we could conceivably become subject to requirements and obligations not only at the federal level  but also in any of the states in which we have customers or from which third persons initiate communications to call our customers  as well as in any of those jurisdictions in which facilities exist or activities occur which support our offerings 
further  if we expand into additional lines of business or make new service offerings  we could become subject to existing or future regulation or other legal requirements  including but not limited to those which apply to telecommunications services and the providers of such services 
the impact of federal or state legislative  regulatory  or adjudicatory actions or requirements may include an increase in our costs  adversely affect how we conduct our business  and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our common stock our executive officers  directors and stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over stockholder votes 
our executive officers  directors and stockholders together beneficially own approximately of our common stock  including shares subject to options and warrants that confer beneficial ownership of the underlying shares 
accordingly  these stockholders  for the foreseeable future will continue to have significant influence over our affairs including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets 
this concentrated control will limit the ability of shareholders to influence corporate matters and  as a result  we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial 
for example  this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock 
provisions in delaware law and our charter documents may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us and could depress the price of our common stock 
provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which would make it difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without requiring stockholder approval  and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal  and our certificate of incorporation or bylaws creates a classified board of directors  prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors  limits the persons who may call special meetings of our stockholders  and imposes advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters to be acted upon by our stockholders 
these and other provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interests of our stockholders  and the price at which shares of our common stock are purchased and sold therefore may be depressed 

table of contents we are incurring increased costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we are incurring significant additional legal  accounting and other expenses 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq national market  require changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these new rules and regulations have resulted in increased legal and financial compliance costs and management efforts and we expect those costs and efforts to continue to increase 
it has become more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and it may become more difficult to obtain such insurance in the future  which may cause us to accept reduced policy limits and reduced coverage or to incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur  but these additional costs and demands on management time and attention may harm our business and results of operations 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be the sole source of potential gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future
