item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview net income in fiscal increased to approximately million compared with approximately million in fiscal the increased earnings in fiscal were primarily attributable to increase in net sales with increases in the stores and direct marketing  or catalog and internet segments  basis point increase in gross profit margins  and the opening of new stores 
management believes that the chain can grow to approximately stores from the fiscal year end base of stores 
the company plans to open between to stores in fiscal as part of its plan to grow the chain to the store level 
the store growth is part of a strategic plan the company initiated in fiscal in the past five years  the company has continued to open new stores as infrastructure and performance has improved 
as such  there were new stores opened in fiscal  new stores opened in fiscal  new stores opened in fiscal  new stores opened in fiscal and new stores opened in fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million in fiscal  primarily to fund the opening of approximately to new stores  the renovation and or relocation of several stores  and the implementation of various systems projects 
the capital expenditures include the cost of the construction of leasehold improvements for new stores of which million is expected to be reimbursed through landlord contributions 
the company also expects inventories to increase in to support new store openings and sales growth in both the company s stores and direct marketing segments 
the company ended fiscal with no revolver debt  million of term debt and million of cash 
the company generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal  which was used to fund a increase in the number of stores and to fund increases in inventory of approximately million to support new store growth and to increase the availability of certain core items 
the company s credit agreement with its bank extends to april and allows the company to borrow a maximum revolving amount under the facility up to million 
in addition  the company has the option to increase the amount borrowed to million  if requested by april   if needed and if supported by its borrowing base formula under the credit agreement 
the company s availability in excess of outstanding borrowings  as supported by the existing borrowing base under its credit agreement  was million at january   as compared with million at january  common stock dividends 
on december   the company s board of directors declared a common stock dividend payable on february  to stockholders of record as of january  in conjunction with the distribution of the stock dividend  the company retired all of its previously held shares of treasury stock 
unless otherwise indicated  all historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to the number of common shares elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto  have been restated to reflect the stock dividend 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements  a number of assumptions and estimates are made that  in the judgment of management  are proper in light of existing general economic and company specific circumstances 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
inventory 
the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market lcm 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
the company reduces the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value where cost exceeds estimated selling price less costs of disposal 
management s sales assumptions are based on the company s experience that most of the company s inventory is sold through the company s primary sales channels with virtually no inventory being liquidated through bulk sales to third parties 
the company s lcm reserve estimates for inventory that have been made in the past have been very reliable as a significant portion of its sales approximately two thirds in fiscal are classic traditional products that are on going programs and that bear low risk of write down 
these products include items such as navy and gray suits  navy blazers  white and blue button down shirts  etc 
the portions of products that have fashion elements are monitored closely to ensure that aging goals are achieved to limit the need to sell significant amounts of product below cost 
in addition  the company s strong gross profit margins enable the company to sell substantially all of its products at levels above cost 
to calculate the estimated market value of its inventory  the company periodically performs a detailed review of all of its major inventory classes and stock keeping units 
the company compares the on hand units and season to date unit sales including actual selling prices to the sales trend and estimated prices required to sell the units in the future  which enables the company to estimate the amount which may have to be sold below cost 
many of the units sold below cost are sold in the company s factory stores within twenty four months of purchase 
in fiscal and  the company s costs in excess of selling price plus the cost of disposal in its factory stores was million and million  respectively 
the inventory component of these costs is recorded in cost of goods sold whereas the related costs of disposal are recorded as selling and marketing expenses 
the company anticipates similar results in fiscal if the inventory required to be sold through the factory stores or liquidated through other means varies from the estimate  the company s lcm reserve could change 
asset valuation 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment subject to depreciation  are periodically reviewed for impairment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the asset valuation estimate is principally dependent on the company s ability to generate profits at both the company and store levels 
these levels are principally driven by the sales and gross profit trends that are closely monitored by the company 
in each of fiscal years and  there have been no asset valuation charges as sales and profits have increased throughout this period 
lease accounting 
the company uses a consistent lease period generally  the initial non cancelable lease term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements and in determining straight line rent expense and classification of its leases as either an operating lease or a capital lease 
the lease term and straight line rent expense commences on the date when the company takes possession and has the right to control use of the leased premises 
funds received from the lessor intended to reimburse the company for the costs of leasehold improvements are recorded as a deferred credit resulting from a lease incentive and amortized over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense 
while the company has taken reasonable care in preparing these estimates and making these judgments  actual results could and probably will differ from the estimates 
management believes any difference in the actual results from the estimates will not have a material effect upon the company s financial position or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
this statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
through the end of  companies were required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and could elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
the company chose to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas r  however  in adopting this standard  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal and will apply the provisions of sfas r prospectively  under the modified prospective method  in all periods following fiscal the valuation model and amortization assumption we used prior to adoption are acceptable methods under sfas r and the company has chosen to continue to use the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
as all stock options issued were fully vested as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal  adoption of the provisions of sfas r will not have a material impact on the future reporting periods  unless the company grants additional options or stock based awards 
as of january   the company had no shares available for issuance under the current plans 
sfas r will also require us to change the classification of any tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options in excess of that which is associated with the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes 
these amounts will be presented as a financing cash inflow  rather than as a reduction of income taxes paid in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
