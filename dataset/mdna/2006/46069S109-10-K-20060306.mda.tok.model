item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
this discussion generally refers to elements within our consolidated financial statements on a pre tax basis unless otherwise stated 
except for historical information  the discussions in this section contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed below

overview we focus our design  manufacturing and marketing efforts on the high performance analog hpa segment of the semiconductor market 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the hpa segment is distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
historically  the hpa segment has yielded higher gross margins and suffers less competition than the digital and broader analog segments of the semiconductor market 
the hpa segment requires uniquely talented and experienced designers  engineers and specialized selling and marketing efforts to address the myriad of challenges associated with today s complex applications 
we began our transformation into an hpa company with the acquisition of elantec in  the divestiture of our wireless networking business in and further strengthened with the acquisition of xicor 
our first full year as a pure hpa company was fiscal we achieved quarter over quarter revenue and earnings per share growth in each of the quarters of our revenue growth has been very broad based across many products 
our investments to expand our product portfolio to over product families appear to be enabling us to 
table of contents reduce the seasonal effect on our quarterly revenue 
we have introduced hundreds of new products in each of the last few years including several new product families that have significantly expanded our served available market

table of contents geographical revenue millions revenue of total revenue of total revenue of total asia pacific north america europe total revenue our revenue for was million  an increase of million or over this increase was primarily due to a increase in high end consumer products  single digit percentage growth in computing and industrial products  and a partially offsetting decline of in our communications products 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased sales by approximately million  which was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices asps  which decreased sales by approximately million 
of this sales growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in asian and pacific rim regions and million from north america  which was partially offset by an approximately million sales decline to customers in europe 
our revenue for was million  an increase of million or over this growth was primarily due to a increase in high end consumer products and a increase in communications products  which was partially offset by a decline of in our computing products 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased sales by million  this was offset by a decline in asps  which decreased sales by million 
of this sales growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in asian and pacific rim regions and was bolstered by sales growth in europe of approximately million 
we anticipate that our revenue from asian and pacific rim customers will continue to grow in both absolute and percentage terms as that region s companies lead in manufacture of the finished applications consumer electronics  computers  industrial equipment that our products are used in 
end market demand for those applications is more global and hence dependent on aggregate global economic metrics and conditions such as personal incomes and business activity 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin improved slightly during compared to a decrease in the decrease in gross margin was partially due to a decline in asps and also due to two hurricanes that impacted our operations in palm bay  florida 
these hurricane related costs consisted primarily of additional paid time off during the temporary closure of our palm bay facilities 
operating expenses research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses increased by to million for compared to million for and million for our r d spending increased by in compared to due to additional 
table of contents r d spending associated with our acquisition of xicor in july the modest increase in r d expenses during reflects the first full year of an integrated r d function and the synergies gained by combining the xicor r d organization 
we expect our future r d expenses to grow at a higher rate than in as we continue to increase our new product introductions 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  information systems  legal  executive and other administrative functions 
our sg a expenses increased by to million for compared to million for and million for the increase in compared to was driven primarily by increased selling and marketing expenses associated with higher sales 
the increase in compared to was driven by increased selling expenses associated with higher sales and increased labor costs resulting from the acquisition of xicor during amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased by to million for compared to million for and million for the increase in compared to resulted from a full year of amortization of developed technology acquired with our purchase of xicor in july compared to only five months of amortization recognized during the increase in compared to resulted from the acquisition of developed technology acquired with our purchase of xicor in july as well as additional amortization of intangible assets acquired with our purchase of bitblitz communications  inc in definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we review goodwill for impairment indicators quarterly and perform substantive impairment testing annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the value of our reporting units exceeded the goodwill value stated on our balance sheet and therefore  did not record any impairment to goodwill 
however  our goodwill value is dependent on many factors including future market demand for our products  our stock market valuation  valuation of our expected cash flow  relative values of our reporting units and many other factors 
we could have goodwill impairment in the future which would negatively impact our earnings 
amortization of unearned compensation amortization of unearned compensation increased to million for compared to million for and million for the increase in compared to resulted in a full year of amortization compared to only six months of amortization in the decrease in compared to resulted from an increase from the purchase of xicor offset by a decrease in amortization related to the purchase of elantec semiconductor in in process research and development ipr d in connection with our acquisition of xicor in july  we allocated million of the purchase price to ipr d projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the ipr d had no alternative future uses and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as a charge to income in fiscal year see footnote to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein relating to the xicor acquisition consideration and allocation of purchase price  including that allocated to ipr d 
impairment of long lived assets during  we announced that we would move all internal volume of our micron wafer processing to an outside provider s manufacturing facility and our florida manufacturing capacity will be used to manufacture 
table of contents products using greater than micron proprietary processes 
in conjunction with this shift  we recorded an impairment of million million net of tax during the quarter ended april  on certain production equipment that was used to produce the micron wafers at our palm bay facility 
the impairment was calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over their fair value as determined by the market prices of these types of assets 
the majority of these assets have either been sold or are being held for sale 
during and  we reversed and million  respectively  of the impairment on this equipment as the actual selling price of certain assets exceeded the impaired value by at least that amount 
restructurings we have completed multiple restructuring plans during the to time span as we execute our long term high performance analog business objectives 
the cumulative effects of these restructurings have resulted in our estimate of approximately million in reduced annual operating costs and we believe has streamlined our business operations and enabled measurable progress toward our business objectives 
severance related costs are expensed when incurred and substantially all of our severance agreements entitle terminated employees to benefits upon notification of termination 
restructurings that were to reflect our xicor acquisition integration are described below july in july  we announced a restructuring plan to streamline our manufacturing and support functions and recorded million in restructuring expense 
approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated the affected positions included manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative employees 
all of the employees were located in the united states 
as of december   all of the affected positions had been terminated 
we realized the following annual benefits as a result of this restructuring a reduction in the cost of product sales of million a reduction in research and development expenses of million a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
march in march  we announced a restructuring plan to further streamline operations and to reduce costs 
the restructuring plan included the termination of employment of approximately of our workforce and we recorded million in restructuring expense 
approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated 
the affected positions included manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative employees 
as of december   the affected positions had all been terminated 
we realized the following annual benefits as a result of this restructuring a reduction in the cost of product sales of million a reduction in research and development expenses of million a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
other gains losses during we recovered million for insured business interruption losses resulting from the hurricanes in during  our florida facilities were damaged by hurricanes resulting in million in reconstruction costs 
the remaining million contained in the other losses line resulted from the license agreement that the company entered into with a third party wherein we licensed sales rights that had been disputed relating to our ability to sell components for certain cellular technology applications 

table of contents gain on sale of certain operations during  we recorded an additional million million net of tax gain related to the sale of our discrete power product group 
this gain was the result of a reduction of accrued exit costs due to favorable contract termination negotiations with software vendors 
similarly  in fiscal year  we recorded an additional million million net of tax gain related to the sale of our discrete power product group 
this gain was the result of a reduction of accrued exit costs due to favorable contract negotiations with landlords and other vendors 
interest income  net our interest income increased to million in compared to million for and million for interest income increased in due almost solely to increased interest rates earned on our investments compared to our interest income increased to million due to longer maturities on our held to maturity investment balances and increases in short term interest rates 
we net a small amount of bank fees and charges against our interest income for presentation purposes 
gain loss on investments during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a cost method investment  recognized a million gain million net of tax from the sale of all shares of globespanvirata  inc globespan common stock received as part of the sale of our wireless networking product group and recorded a gain of million million net of tax from sale of our investment in another company in june at year end  we had marketable securities that consisted of shares of a former related party s common stock that were classified as investments on the balance sheet 
they were recorded at fair value  which was determined based on quoted market prices 
as of january  we carried an unrealized gain on the investment of million  before taxes 
we held approximately of the company s shares outstanding  at january  during  we sold all of our holdings in the former related party for a realized gain of million million net of tax 
proceeds from the sale were million 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for compared to a tax benefit of million or of pretax income for and tax expense of million or of pretax income for our income tax expense for included a provision of million relating to our repatriation of million of foreign earnings 
see footnote in our consolidated financial statements for more information about our repatriation 
the tax benefit realized in was primarily due to a settlement of our and internal revenue service audits  an increase in our tax exempt investments and the impact of the in process r d charge related to the xicor acquisition 
in determining net income  we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final 
table of contents outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate described above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
see footnote for our statutory to effective tax rate reconciliation for the three years ended december  discontinued operations during  we recognized a gain on the sale of our wireless networking product group 
in  we recorded an additional gain of million million net of tax primarily as a result of finalizing a contingent working capital adjustment with the buyer 
also  during  we reached a settlement with agere systems corporation on all pending litigations related to our wireless networking product group under mutually agreeable terms 
as part of the confidential agreement  we recorded an expense of million million net of tax 
in we settled a foreign tax liability relating to this sale  which made up the majority of our loss of million million net of tax from discontinued operations 
backlog our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders become non cancelable thirty days prior to our original committed delivery date for standard products and ninety days prior to our original committed delivery date for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
our year end backlog for was million  for it was million  and it was million 
although not always the case  we believe backlog can be an indicator of performance for approximately the next two quarters 
business outlook the first quarter of any year is a quarter in which we expect a sequential decline in total sales due to the normal seasonality of our business 
as we announced via our fourth quarter earnings press release filed with our current report on form k  both as of january   we believe that despite historical seasonality  our recent design win momentum makes it likely that our first quarter fiscal revenue will be approximately flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal based on this outlook  we believe our history of sales growth in will continue into the press release stated that in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect earnings per share of to per share 
this earnings per share estimate includes quarterly option expense of per share and amortization of acquisition related intangibles of 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of december  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years future minimum operating lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments standby letters of credit total 
table of contents our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments include million for building improvements relating to our palm bay campus consolidation and million for test and handling equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments include purchase orders for million for externally produced wafers 
we utilize standby letters of credit primarily for security for various contracts or services such as workers compensation million  environmental items million  as well as for security for certain vendor relationships 
these standby letters of credit have annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any guarantees that would affect our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
we do not have any relationships with other parties that would have a material negative impact on our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including the requisite capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements  our dividend program  our treasury share repurchase program and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
as of december   our total shareholders equity was billion 
at that date we also had million in cash and short term securities  as well as million in long term investments 
we have no debt outstanding 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three fiscal years ended december  are presented in this summarized table fiscal years ended jan  dec  dec   millions sources of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes proceeds from exercise of stock options  warrants and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan uses of cash business improvement investments business acquisitions and divestitures  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds returned to shareholders stock repurchases dividends paid cash investment management activities decrease increase in investments and foreign exchange effects net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents in each of the three years  our primary sources of cash have generated nearly or over million 
we have returned a substantial amount of that cash to shareholders via our stock repurchase programs and our dividend payments 
in we acquired xicor for a combination of cash and stock that represents a strategic growth investment to strengthen our power management products and our management 
the aim of the xicor acquisition  as with most acquisitions that we might pursue  is to increase future cash flows from operating activities 
the cash portion of the purchase price for xicor represents a significant portion of the million shown in the table above in fiscal for business acquisitions 
the basic aim of the company is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities and use the majority of that cash flow to return to stockholders 
we will also continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that may further improve our base business with prospects of a proper return 
acquisitions  should we undertake them to improve our business  might be made for either cash or stock consideration  or a combination of both 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments noted above  when combined with lack of any outstanding long or short term debt obligations  give us the flexibility to continue to return much of our free cash flow to our stockholders while also pursuing business improvement opportunities for our future 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase primarily reflects our year over year fourth quarter sales improvement in of over inventories decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  as we improved turns with our increased business levels 
we believe our overall working capital investment will remain relatively constant in relation to our volume of business activity measured by sales revenues and unit volumes for the foreseeable future 
our standard trade receivable terms range from net to net days 
from time to time  management has made exceptions to these standard terms for various business and competitive reasons and extended the terms up to days 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal our fiscal rate was much closer to our normal rate of capital expenditures 
in we had invested significantly in our foundry and fabrication operations in florida 
in our expenditures focused on test and packaging equipment and expenditures related to preparing for our campus consolidation in florida 
proceeds from exercises of stock options and our stock purchase plan in  with our rising stock price  we enjoyed increased cash flow from stock plans exercises of stock options and sales under our espp 
at more than million for the fiscal year  cash collected from such exercises approached the million sum of the prior two years 
while the level of such cash inflow to us is subject to certain market forces we don t control  we believe that such proceeds will remain an important secondary source of cash after operating cash flow 
stock repurchases and dividends we currently have in effect an active stock repurchase program and a per share quarterly dividend program 
both programs represent our major effort to return our operating cash flow to our shareholders and we currently intend to continue both programs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents transactions with related and certain other parties former related party intersil had a contract in place with a former related party  which expired in mid year fiscal  in which they provided a specified percentage of intersil s test and package services 
the terms of the contract were the result of arms length negotiations and  in the opinion of management  were no less favorable than those that could be obtained from non affiliated parties 
at the time the contract was entered into the companies shared a common board member and intersil once held an equity position in the asian company 
although the company continues to procure a portion of its test and package services from this firm  it utilizes other vendors for these services as well 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have included our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimates  in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimates  and the possible effects on our financial condition 
the five accounting estimation processes discussed below are the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  distributor  oem and warranty reserves  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  and tax valuation allowances these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  or receivables allowance december  in millions december  in millions gross trade receivables receivables allowance other allowances net trade receivables our receivables allowance was million on gross trade receivables of million at december  and million on gross trade receivables of million at december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but will have such an inability  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of december  equaled of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity 
table of contents issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
distributor  oem and warranty reserves  or other allowances shown in the immediately foregoing table relating to receivables allowance as other allowances  are our allowances for various reserves for eventual customer credits 
this is a combination of distributor  original electronic manufacturer oem and warranty reserves 
distributor reserves were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
revenue is recognized from sales to all other customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor reserves are amounts within our trade receivable allowance section of the balance sheet that estimate the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on the inventory that is held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
as the amount of inventory held by international distributors that will be adjusted in the future cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof  we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions 
the international distributor reserves comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component of international distributor reserves is the price protection reserve  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices which are common in semiconductors and other electronic components 
this reserve is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation reserve  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
specific reserves for our oem customers  of which various types of returns are the largest component  totaled million at december   warranty reserves  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million as of december  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  or inventory reserves we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market as described in the footnotes to the financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will recoup through sales on our inventory can not be known with exact certainty as of the date of this filing  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although due to the commonality between our products  raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we reserve of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
reviews are conducted of excess inventory on a monthly basis 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete 
we reserve approximately to of the standard cost of the excess inventory 
we believe that approximately represents the portion we will not be able to recover when we attempt to sell this inventory due to our new product next generation introductions and other technological advancements 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete during the process described above  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization specific to that inventory 
inventory reserves totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million at december  and million on gross inventory of million at december  product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory reserves 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical product sales 
historical sales may not accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to scrap obsolete inventory 

table of contents assessment of recoverability of goodwill pursuant to our adoption of sfas on december   we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and found no impairment 
according to our accounting policy  we also performed an annual review during the fourth quarter of each subsequent year  and have found no impairment in any period 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is tested under the two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
our reporting units at december  were the analog signal processing and power management product groups 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on goodwill since adopting sfas tax valuation allowances as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to usage and thereby reversal of deferred tax assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting of xicor associated with their net operating loss carryforwards nols 
an analysis is performed relating to our ability to continue to utilize these nols and we have concluded  as discussed above  that these assets will likely be recovered from future taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb statement r share based payment in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its interpretations  and amends fasb s statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas r is similar to the fair value approach permitted in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values ie  pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition 
the company adopted sfas r effective with its fiscal year which began december  in october  the company took the action of mitigating a portion of the prospective effect on its financial statements through an acceleration of certain unvested stock options 
this acceleration is expected to reduce the after tax stock option expense it would otherwise have been required to record by approximately million over a three year period our fiscal  inclusive  of 
table of contents which approximately million would have been recorded in fiscal even with this acceleration action  the application of sfas r will have a negative effect on consolidated net income 
in a press release dated january   the company estimated this negative effect on the first quarter of fiscal to be approximately of diluted net income per share 
in august  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp r  classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued as employee compensation 
this fsp defers the requirement of sfas r that a freestanding financial instrument originally subject to sfas r becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable generally accepted accounting principles gaap when the rights conveyed by the instrument to the holder are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee of the entity 
under the provisions of the fsp  a freestanding financial instrument originally issued as employee compensation shall be subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas r throughout the life of the instrument  unless its terms are modified subsequent to the time the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the individual being an employee 
in october  the fasb issued fsp r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
this fsp provides guidance with regard to the determination of the grant date of a share based payment instrument by expanding on the meaning of the parties reaching a mutual understanding of the terms and conditions of such award 
in november  the fasb issued fsp r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees 
this matter has to do with the ability or lack thereof of entities to quantify their apic pool of excess tax benefits which may be available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized after the adoption of sfas r 
in february  the fasb issued fsp r  classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
this fsp addresses the classification of options and other instruments that are issued as share based payments that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
this guidance amends the requirement that any opportunity or circumstance permitting settlement of the instrument in cash would cause its classification to be as a liability on an entity s balance sheet 
fasb statement no 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no

 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
statement also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
opinion previously required that such a change be reported as a change in accounting principle 
statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted statement effective with its fiscal year which began on december  and does not anticipate any effect of this pronouncement on its statements of operations 

table of contents ed on earnings per share an amendment to fas in december  the fasb decided to defer the issuance of its final standard on earnings per share eps entitled earnings per share an amendment to fas in september  the fasb issued its further deliberations on this subject as an exposure draft ed of the same name 
a final standard is expected to be adopted in the significant proposed changes to the eps computation are changes to the treasury stock method and contingent share guidance for computing year to date eps  removal of the ability to overcome the presumption of share settlement when computing diluted eps when there is a choice of share or cash settlement and inclusion of mandatorily convertible securities in basic eps 
additionally  the ed proposed further changes of a complex and technical nature in the application of fas we are currently evaluating the proposed provisions of this amendment to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks

as hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
total net gains on foreign exchange contracts for were approximately million 
during  we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was nominal  at december  the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions fiscal year ended december  december  gain loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts at year end fair value of open contracts at year end our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments
