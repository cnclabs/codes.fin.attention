industry background communications the communications industry  and its underlying technology  has gone through a significant transformation during the last several years 
it has been driven by the continuing adoption of broadband  and the increasing 
table of contents consumer demand for more services delivered at ever faster speeds 
this phenomenon has changed the complexion of the market  and the companies that support it 
the industry is typified by increasing competition with the convergence of telecommunication and cable satellite operators expanding to offer telecommunications  internet and video services 
recently  the telecommunication industry has experienced consolidation as surviving carriers acquire wireline and wireless networks to compete with expanded coverage and services 
the network infrastructure a highway of interconnections must transmit varied traffic voice  data and video at different speeds over the internet 
to accomplish this  oems are designing complex ics in multi service equipment leveraging industry standard protocols and high data transmission speeds enabling networks to communicate with each other 
in north america  the high speed data traffic standard is synchronous optical network sonet  and in most of the rest of the world  it is synchronous data hierarchy sdh 
over optical fiber  the sonet sdh standard ensures network reliability  data integrity and the interoperability of equipment deployed across the network from different manufacturers 
additionally  carriers are ramping up triple play services voice  data and video over converged wireless and wireline infrastructure using standards based multi protocol over sonet sdh solutions and on greenfield deployments using native ethernet based technologies  while making sure that reliable and seamless services are offered across these multiple inter networking domains 
beyond the wireline infrastructure  wireless services have also evolved during this period with more carriers offering consumers advanced capabilities such as video conferencing and wireless tv services 
the combined effect of all of these changes in the telecommunications market is driving ic manufacturers to increase the bandwidth supported by their devices by providing vertical integration more functionality and horizontal integration more channels 
this push to more cost effective devices in turn is increasing the adoption rate of these services in both the established and emerging markets 
the company believes that ic companies with analog and digital design expertise and a deep understanding of system level applications will have a competitive advantage in this changing market environment 
storage the need for reliable and cost effective storage technologies has increased almost exponentially with the increased volume of data transmitted over the internet 
this data now includes critical business and personal information  which in many cases no longer has paper back up 
this increase in the volume of data is already pushing ic manufacturers to constantly augment the throughput of their devices to data rates of three gigabytes per second and higher 
the critical nature of the data is also pressuring ic manufacturers to pay constant attention to the performance of these devices especially at the physical layer 
data reliability and security is improved by distributing the storage functionality across multiple hosts and drives 
this method includes deploying port multipliers that provide access to multiple disk drives by a single host and deploying port selectors that allow multiple hosts to access a single drive 
in some cases  both the port multiplier and port selector functionality is implemented in a single system that addresses both the reliability and redundancy requirements of a storage system 
clock and timing during the past several years  clock and timing products have played a more ubiquitous and critical role within digital systems 
the appetite of consumers for digital entertainment and instant global connectivity  and the drive for complex data processing require a broad range of timing solutions 
this change in system dynamics is fueling the need to support higher speed synchronization and communication between complex microprocessors  memory  application specific integrated circuits asics  and other elements on the system board 
to effectively facilitate gigabyte rates in communications systems  clock and timing solutions now have to provide very high frequencies combined with stringent jitter performance

item a 
risk factors we are subject to a number of risks 
some of these risks are endemic to the high technology industry and are the same or similar to those disclosed in our previous sec filings  and some new risks may arise in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this annual report before investing in us 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the high technology industry does not lessen the significance of these risks 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and stockholders might lose some or all of their investment 
if we are unable to generate revenue above current levels from the sale of our communications products  or our revenue from these products declines  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted 
we continue to focus a significant portion of our research and sales resources on the communications market with the expectation that the communications sector will grow over the long term 
given our dependence on the communications market to support revenue growth  we must continue to generate additional sales from this market by successfully marketing the existing product portfolio  introducing new products and securing design wins which are released into production or by gaining market share 
if we are unable to generate increased revenue from our communications products or our revenue from these products declines  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted 
the uncertainty in the us and global economies  as well as the communications equipment market  may continue to materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
periodic declines or fluctuations in corporate profits  lower capital equipment spending  the impact of conflicts throughout the world  terrorist acts  natural disasters  the outbreak of communicable diseases such as the 
table of contents avian flu and other geopolitical factors have had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on the us and global economies 
our revenue and profitability have generally followed the modest recovery of the communications equipment industry 
this modest recovery has affected carrier capital equipment spending which in turn has affected the demand for our customers products  thus affecting our revenues and profitability 
communications service providers and equipment manufacturers continue to experience consolidation in their industries 
although there currently appears to be positive signs for growth  further delay or reduction in anticipated communications equipment spending levels may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are unable to predict the timing  strength or duration of the communications market recovery or effects of equipment manufacturer consolidation 
if the sector does not continue to recover measurably  or declines  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products in our core or new markets that meet evolving market needs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
the markets for our products are characterized by changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer requirements  increasing costs of product development  long design to production cycles  competitive solutions  frequent product introductions and enhancements  increasing functional integration  increasing price pressure  moderate to slow growth  capital equipment spending levels and or deployment  and or changing competitive landscape consolidation  financial conditions 
our success depends in part on the successful development of new products for our core markets 
we must i be able to anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards  ii be able to accurately define and develop  on a timely basis  new products  iii be able to gain access to and use technologies in a cost effective manner  iv continue to expand our technical and design expertise  v be able to timely introduce and cost effectively have manufactured new products  vi be able to differentiate our products from our competitors offerings  and vii gain customer acceptance of our products 
in addition  we must continue to have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers to develop new products that meet their evolving needs 
moreover  we must be able to respond to shifts in market demands  the trend towards increasing functional integration and other changes in a rapid and cost effective manner 
migration from older products to newer products may result in volatility of earnings during periods of transition of the products 
products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards and new technologies 
our ability to compete will depend in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
the emergence of new standards could render our products incompatible with systems 
table of contents developed by major communications equipment manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time  effort and expenses to develop and qualify new products to ensure compliance with industry standards 
the process of developing and supporting new products is complex  expensive and uncertain  and if we fail to accurately predict and understand our customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business may be harmed 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products  achieve design wins  ensure when and which design wins actually get released to production  or respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
in addition  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or may incorrectly anticipate market demand and develop products that achieve little or no market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense and may ultimately prove unsuccessful 
failure in any of these areas may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to convert a significant portion of our design wins into actual revenue  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
we have secured a significant number of design wins for new and existing products 
such design wins are necessary for revenue growth 
however  many of our design wins may never generate revenues if their end customer projects are unsuccessful in the market place or the end customer terminates the project  which may occur for a variety of reasons 
additionally  some of our design wins are with privately held  early stage companies that may fail to bring their product to market 
if design wins do generate revenue  the time lag between the design win and meaningful revenue may be in excess of eighteen months 
if we fail to convert a significant portion of our design wins into substantial revenue  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
our financial results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our financial results may fluctuate significantly 
some of the factors that affect our financial results  many of which are difficult or impossible to control or predict  are our difficulty predicting revenues and ordering the correct mix of products from suppliers due to limited visibility provided by customers and channel partners coupled with a high number of orders placed for products to be shipped in the same quarter  the reduction  rescheduling  cancellation or timing of orders by our customers and channel partners due to  among others  the following factors  management of customer  subcontractor and or channel inventory  dependency on a single product with a single customer  volatility of demand for equipment sold by our large customers  which in turn  introduces demand volatility for our products  temporary disruption in customer demand as customers change or modify their complex subcontract manufacturing supply chain  the inability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  and disruption in the sales or distribution channels  changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products  
table of contents the ability of our suppliers  customers and communications service providers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures  changes in the mix of products that our customers purchase  risks associated with entering new markets  such as increased competition  should we decide to do so  the announcement or introduction of products by our competitors  loss of market share by our customers  competitive pressures on selling prices or product availability  pressures on selling prices overseas due to foreign currency exchange fluctuations  erosion of average selling prices coupled with the inability to sell newer products with higher average selling prices  resulting in lower overall revenue and margins  market and or customer acceptance of our products  consolidation among our competitors  our customers and or our customers customers  changes in our customers end user concentration or requirements  loss of one or more major customers  significant changes in ordering pattern by major customers  our or our channel partners ability to maintain adequate inventory levels  the availability and cost of materials and services  including foundry  assembly and test capacity  needed by us from our foundries and suppliers  discontinuance of wafer fabrication or packaging technologies by our suppliers  if wafer fabrications or packaging and test suppliers discontinue or experience extended disruption of supply  we may incur increased costs to obtain alternative suppliers or investment in inventory to meet continuity of supply obligations to customers  temporary disruptions in our or our customers supply chain due to natural disaster  fire  outbreak of communicable diseases such as the avian flu  or labor disputes  fluctuations in the manufacturing output  yield capabilities  and capacity of our suppliers  fluctuation in suppliers capacity due to reorganization  relocation or shift in business focus  problems  costs  or delays that we may face in shifting our products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design and device integration  our ability to successfully introduce and transfer into production new products and or integrate new technologies  increase in manufacturing costs  increase in mask tooling costs associated with advanced technologies  the amount and timing of our investment in research and development  costs and business disruptions associated with shareholder or regulatory issues  the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on our employees gains on stock options exercised  increasing costs and time associated with compliance with accounting rules or other regulatory requirements  
table of contents changes in accounting or other regulatory rules  such as the future requirement to record expenses for employee stock option grants  fluctuations in interest rates and or market values of our marketable securities  litigation costs associated with the defense of suits brought or complaints made against us  and or legislators desire or ability to renew favorable tax legislation in a timely manner  which may subject our tax provision to volatility 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in the future 
any of the foregoing factors  or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made and may in the future make acquisitions and significant strategic equity investments  which may involve a number of risks 
if we are unable to address these risks successfully  such acquisitions and investments could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have undertaken a number of strategic acquisitions and investments in the past and may do so from time to time in the future 
the risks involved with these acquisitions and investments include  among others the possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investment or incur losses from our investment  or the original investment may become impaired  failure to satisfy the strategic objectives  our assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated events or circumstances  and or the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business 
additional risks involved with acquisitions include  among others difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company or its assets  difficulty in supporting acquired products or technologies  difficulties or delays in the transfer of manufacturing flows and supply chains of products of acquired businesses  failure to retain key personnel  unexpected capital equipment outlays and related expenses  difficulties in entering markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  under performance problems with an acquired company  issuance of common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  recording of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to periodic impairment testing and potential impairment charges against our future earnings  incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments  
table of contents incurring large and immediate write offs  and or becoming subject to litigation 
risks involved with strategic equity investments include  among others the possibility of litigation resulting from these types of investments  the possibility that we may not receive a favorable return on our investments or incur losses from these investments  or the original investment may become impaired  a change or poorly executed strategic plan  and or the opportunity cost associated with committing capital in such investments 
we cannot assure that we will be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
any delays or other such operations or financial problems could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not integrate acquired technology successfully 
we have made and may in the future acquire intellectual property to accelerate our time to market for new products 
acquisitions of intellectual property may involve risks such as successful technical integration into existing products  market acceptance of new products  and achievement of planned return on investment 
the potential failure of product introduction utilizing acquired intellectual property could lead to an impairment of capitalized intellectual property acquisition costs 
competition in the markets in which we participate  or may participate  may make it more difficult for us to be successful 
we compete against an established group of semiconductor companies that focus on similar markets 
these competitors include applied micro circuits corporation  integrated device technology inc  mindspeed technologies inc  pmc sierra inc  royal philips electronics  texas instruments incorporated  transwitch corporation  vitesse semiconductor corporation and wolfson microelectronics ltd 
additionally  we are facing competition from other established companies and start up businesses that seek to enter the markets in which we participate 
we have experienced increased competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative solutions based on a number of factors  including price  performance  product features  technologies  and availability of long term product supply and or roadmap guarantee 
additionally  we experience  in some cases  severe pressure on pricing from some of our competitors or cost expectations from customers 
such circumstances may make some of our products unattractive due to price or performance measures 
these circumstances may result in us losing design opportunities or may decrease our revenue and margins as a result of the price competition 
also  competitors from new companies in emerging countries with significant lower costs could affect selling price and gross margins 
we depend on third party foundries to manufacture our integrated circuits 
any disruption in or loss of the foundries capacity to manufacture our products subjects us to a number of risks  including the potential for an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility  or a foundry 
most of our products are based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
chartered semiconductor manufacturing ltd  or chartered  located in singapore  manufactures the majority of the cmos wafers from which our 
table of contents products are manufactured 
chartered produces semiconductors for many other companies many of which have greater requirements than us  and therefore we may not have access on a timely basis to sufficient capacity or certain process technologies 
in addition  we are reliant on chartered s continued financial health and ability to continue to invest in smaller geometry manufacturing processes and foundries 
many of our new products are designed to take advantage of smaller geometry manufacturing processes 
due to the complexity and increased cost of migrating to smaller geometries  we may experience problems  which could result in design and production delays of our products 
if such delays occur  our products may have delayed market acceptance or customers may select our competitors products during the design process 
we do not have long term wafer supply agreements with chartered or our other foundries that would guarantee wafer or product quantities  prices  delivery or lead times 
rather  the foundries manufacture our products on a purchase order basis 
we provide chartered and our other foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements 
however  the ability of our foundries to provide wafers is limited by the foundries available capacity 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will continue to do business with chartered or our other foundries on terms as favorable as our current terms 
significant risks associated with our reliance on third party foundries include the lack of assured process technology and wafer supply  financial and operating stability of the foundries  limited control over delivery schedules  limited manufacturing capacity of the foundries  limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and or potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we could experience a substantial delay or interruption in the shipment of our products or an increase in our costs due to any of the following a manufacturing disruption experienced by foundries utilized by us or sudden reduction or elimination of any existing source or sources of semiconductor manufacturing materials or processes  which might include the potential closure  change of ownership  change of management or consolidation by one of our foundries  extended time required to identify  qualify and transfer to alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products  failure of our suppliers to obtain the raw materials and equipment  financial and operating stability of the foundry or any of our suppliers  acts of terrorism or civil unrest or an unanticipated disruption due to communicable diseases  political instability  natural disasters  and or a sudden  sharp increase in demand for semiconductor devices  which could strain the foundries manufacturing resources and cause delays in manufacturing and shipment of our products 
if our foundries discontinue or limit the availability of the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands or are unable to provide the technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may face production delays  which could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our wafer requirements represent a small portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture our products 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a foundry may cease production of a wafer fabrication 
table of contents process required by us 
additionally  we cannot be certain that our foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs and harm our ability to deliver our products on time  or force us to terminate affected products  thereby materially and adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to secure foundry capacity  we may be required to enter into financial and other arrangements with foundries  which could result in the dilution of our earnings or otherwise harm our operating results 
allocation of a foundry s manufacturing capacity may be influenced by a foundry customer s size  the existence of a long term agreement with the foundry or other commitments 
to address foundry capacity constraints  we and other semiconductor companies that rely on third party foundries have utilized various arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries or take or pay contracts that commit a company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
while we are not currently a party to any of these arrangements  we may decide to enter into these arrangements in the future 
we cannot be sure  however  that these arrangements will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
any of these arrangements could require us to commit substantial capital and  accordingly  could require us to reduce our cash holdings  incur additional debt or secure equity financing 
this could result in the dilution of our earnings or the ownership of our stockholders or otherwise harm our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient foundry capacity in the future pursuant to such arrangements 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including the potential for an inadequate supply of products and higher materials costs 
these risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on independent subcontractors in asia for all of the assembly and the majority of the testing of our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following risks our reduced control over manufacturing yields  production schedules and product quality  the potential closure  change of ownership  change in business conditions or relationships  change of management or consolidation by one or more of our subcontractors  long term financial stability of our subcontractors and their ability to invest in new capabilities and equipment  disruption of services due to the outbreak of communicable diseases such as the avian flu  acts of terrorism  natural disasters  labor disputes  or civil unrest  disruption of manufacturing or test services due to relocation of subcontractor manufacturing facilities  failure of our subcontractors to obtain the raw materials and equipment  entry into take or pay agreements  difficulties in selecting  qualifying and integrating new subcontractors  reallocation or limited manufacturing capacity of the subcontractors  a sudden  sharp increase in demand for semiconductor devices  which could strain the subcontractor s manufacturing resources and cause delays in manufacturing and shipment of our products  limited warranties from the subcontractors for products assembled and tested for us  
table of contents the possible unavailability of qualified assembly or test services  the subcontractors may cease production on a specific package type used to assemble product required by us and the possible inability to obtain an alternate source to supply the package  potential increases in assembly and test costs  and or the third party subcontractors abilities to transition to smaller package types and to new package compositions 
these risks may lead to shipment delays and supply constraints of our products or increased cost for the finished products  either of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reliance on foreign suppliers exposes us to risks associated with international operations  any of which could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we use semiconductor wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors throughout asia to manufacture a significant portion of our products 
our dependence on these subcontractors involves the following risks disruption of services due to political  civil  labor  and economic instability  disruption of services due to natural disasters or outbreak of communicable diseases such as the avian flu  disruption of transportation to and from asia  embargoes or other regulatory limitations affecting the availability of raw materials  equipment or services  changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates  and or compliance with local or international regulatory requirements 
these risks may lead to delays in product delivery or increased costs  either of which could harm our profitability and customer relationships  thereby materially and adversely impacting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend in part on the continued service of our key engineering and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire  incent and retain qualified personnel 
if we lost key employees or failed to identify  hire  incent and retain these individuals  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
our future success depends  in part  on the continued service of our key design engineering  technical  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  hire  incent  and retain other qualified personnel 
in the future  we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  including executive officers and other key management and technical personnel necessary for the management of our business 
competition for skilled employees having specialized technical capabilities and industry specific expertise continues to be a considerable risk inherent in the markets in which we compete 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price and the ability to offer options to as many or in amounts consistent with past practices  as a result of regulations regarding the expensing of options  may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
the failure to retain and recruit  as necessary  key design engineers  technical  sales  marketing and executive personnel could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents recent rulemaking by the financial accounting standards board will require us to expense equity compensation given to employees and non employee directors that will significantly harm operating results 
we historically have used stock options as a significant component of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
stock options are also utilized to attract and retain non employee directors 
the financial accounting standards board has adopted changes that will require companies to record a charge to earnings for stock option grants and other equity incentives  which will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we are required to implement the standard as of april  by causing us to incur significantly increased compensation costs  this accounting change will reduce our reported earnings 
our reliance on foreign customers could cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
international sales accounted for  and of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   march  and march   respectively 
international sales will likely continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues  which would subject us to the following risks changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  timing and availability of export or import licenses  disruption of services due to political  civil  labor  and economic instability  disruption of services due to natural disasters  disruptions to customer operations due to the outbreak of communicable diseases such as the avian flu  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  difficulties in managing sales channel partners  difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products  limited intellectual property protection  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the burden of complying with foreign laws and treaties  and or potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  because sales of our products have been denominated primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the relative price of our products such that they become more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country 
increases in the value of the united states dollar could also evoke customers to apply pricing pressures on our products 
increased international activity in the future may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
furthermore  because some of our customers purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  we may be limited in our ability  or it may be too costly for us  to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages  if awarded 
the complexity of our products may lead to errors  defects and bugs  which could subject us to significant costs or damages and adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
although we  our customers and our suppliers rigorously test our products  nonetheless they may contain undetected errors  weaknesses  defects or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
if any of 
table of contents our products contain production defects  reliability  quality or compatibility problems that are significant to our customers  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to continue to buy our products  which could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales of affected products  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if defects or bugs are discovered after commencement of commercial production of a new product  we may be required to make significant expenditures of capital and other resources to resolve the problems 
this could result in significant additional development costs and the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts 
we could also incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products 
these costs or damages could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our distributors or sales representatives stop selling or fail to successfully promote our products  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we sell many of our products through two non exclusive distributors and numerous sales representatives 
our non exclusive distributors and sales representatives may carry our competitors products  which could adversely impact or limit the sales of our products 
additionally  they could reduce or discontinue sales of our products or may not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect 
moreover  we depend on the continued viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales representatives  some of which are small organizations with limited working capital 
in turn  these distributors and sales representatives are subject to general economic and semiconductor industry conditions 
we believe that our success will continue to depend on these distributors and sales representatives 
if some or all of our distributors and sales representatives experience financial difficulties  or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell our products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because our communications integrated circuits typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of revenue derived from these products 
due to the communications integrated circuit  or ic  equipment product development cycle  we have typically experienced at least an eighteen month time lapse between our initial contact with a customer to realizing volume shipments 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take nine months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional nine months 
the customers of communications equipment manufacturers may also require a period of time for testing and evaluation  which may cause further delays 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our communications products by our customers 
due to length of the communications ic equipment product development cycle  the risk of project cancellation by the customer is present for an extended period of time 
our backlog may not result in future revenue 
due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules and quantities actually purchased  cancellation of orders  distributor returns or price reductions  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of the order backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents fixed operating expenses and our practice of ordering materials in anticipation of future customer demand could make it difficult for us to respond effectively to sudden swings in demand and result in higher than expected costs and excess inventory 
such sudden swings in demand could therefore have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short to medium term  and  therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly and sufficiently in response to any revenue shortfall 
in addition  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
this incremental cost could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  mask work registrations  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and non disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite these efforts  we may be unable to protect our proprietary information 
such intellectual property rights may not be recognized or if recognized  it may not be commercially feasible to enforce 
moreover  we cannot be certain that our competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially similar or superior to our technology 
more specifically  we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
nor can we be sure that  if challenged  our patents will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
we could be required to pay substantial damages or could be subject to various equitable remedies if it were proven that we infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
if a third party were to prove that our technology infringed a third party s intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damages for past infringement and could be required to pay license fees or royalties on future sales of our products 
if we were required to pay such license fees whenever we sold our products  such fees could exceed our revenue 
in addition  if it were proven that we willfully infringed a third party s proprietary rights  we could be held liable for three times the amount of the damages that we would otherwise have to pay 
such intellectual property litigation could also require us to stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the infringed intellectual property  obtain a license to make  sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and or redesign our products so as not to use the infringed intellectual property  which may not be technically or commercially feasible 
furthermore  the defense of infringement claims and lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be expensive to resolve and could require a significant portion of management s time 
in addition  rather than 
table of contents litigating an infringement matter  we may determine that it is in our best interests to settle the matter 
terms of a settlement may include the payment of damages and our agreement to license technology in exchange for a license fee and ongoing royalties 
these fees could be substantial 
if we were required to pay damages or otherwise became subject to such equitable remedies  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
similarly  if we were required to pay license fees to third parties based on a successful infringement claim brought against us  such fees could exceed our revenue 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly to date 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to our anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  product delays or setbacks by us  our customers or our competitors  potential supply disruptions  sales channel interruptions  concentration of sales among a small number of customers  conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets  the commencement and or results of litigation  changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts  decreases in the value of our investments  thereby requiring an asset impairment charge against earnings  our repurchasing shares of our common stock  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  the impact of expensing stock options  and or general global economic and market conditions 
in the past  securities and class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
we may be the target of one or more of these class action suits  which could result in significant costs and divert management s attention  thereby harming our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  including semiconductor companies  and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations may harm the market price of our common stock 
earthquakes and other natural disasters may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers 
our corporate headquarters in fremont  california is located near major earthquake faults that have experienced seismic activity 
in addition  some of our customers and suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be disrupted 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster affecting one or more of our major customers or suppliers could adversely impact the operations of those affected  which could disrupt the supply of our products and harm our business

the company is represented in europe and the asia pacific region by its wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  independent sales representatives and independent  non exclusive distributors 
the company s international sales represented   and of net sales for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
these international sales consist primarily of export sales from the united states that are denominated in united states dollars 
such international related operations expenses expose the company to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the company s foreign operating expenses are denominated in foreign currency while its sales are denominated in united states dollars 
although foreign sales within certain countries or foreign sales comprised of certain products may subject the company to tariffs  the company s profit margin on international sales  adjusted for differences in product mix  is not significantly different from that realized on the company s sales to domestic customers 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of several factors that could materially and adversely affect the company s future profitability  as described above in risk factors

during fiscal year  the company experienced continued sales growth in the network and transmission market through sales of its existing and acquired products  the serial communications market and slightly lower sales in the video and imaging markets

outlook for fiscal year the company believes that near term market trends are consistent with improvement in end market demand and that inventories at oem customers and distributors  while increasing  appear to be at appropriate levels to support end demand 
looking forward to the medium to long term  the company believes that broadband 
table of contents connectivity will grow and that carriers will increase their capital spending in the wireline and wireless areas 
therefore  the company believes that it should be able to grow its revenue in line with end demand 
the company anticipates that revenue growth will be driven by increased sales from its network and transmission products  serial communications products and clock products  and also initial revenue from products targeting the storage application market 
the company does  however  continue to experience limited visibility with respect to customer demand and ordering patterns for its communications products resulting from short order to delivery times 
these net sales expectations are subject to change as customer demand and related customer component inventory levels change 
the company s future results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted as a result of such factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying disclosures in conformity with gaap  the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as policies that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company has identified its most critical accounting policies and estimates to be as follows net sales  reserves for excess inventories  income taxes  and non marketable equity securities  which are addressed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding the company s results
