item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation that is a part of this filing 
on january   we acquired certain assets of seven home health agencies in central oklahoma for a total purchase price of million that included million in cash and a three year promissory note of million 
on january   we also acquired an oklahoma based therapy staffing agency for a total purchase price of million that included million in cash and a three year promissory note of million 
these agencies are not included in the results of our operations or in the number of acquisitions that we made in strategy our business objective is to enhance our market position as a leading provider of high quality  low cost home health nursing and hospice services through internal growth and acquisition 
we target our marketing activities toward medicare eligible patients 
approximately of our net service revenue was derived from medicare for the year ended december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements internal growth strategy focus on our employees 
because we are engaged in a service business  the essence of our company is our people 
our emphasis on communication  education  empowerment and competitive benefits allows us to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced people in our markets 
manage costs through disease management 
payors are focusing on the management of patients who suffer from chronic diseases  which correlate with substantial long term costs 
we offer disease management programs for wound care  cardiac and diabetes as well as pulmonary respiratory  pneumonia  cardiovascular and cancer 
our disease management programs include patient and family education and empowerment  frequent monitoring and coordinated care with other medical professionals involved in the care of the patient 
manage costs through technology 
we use an internally developed software system that reduces our operating costs and integrates a number of clinical  financial and operating functions into a single entry system 
the software has been enhanced extensively  particularly with respect to clinical management and has been supplemented by other externally sourced software 
by enhancing our operations through the use of information technology and expanded computer applications  we are positioned to not only operate more efficiently but also to compete in an environment increasingly influenced by cost containment 
expand our service base 
we expand our service base both by increasing market share in existing service areas as well as expanding into contiguous markets and states 
in existing service areas  we increase market share through the development and marketing of niche programs designed to meet the needs of our referral sources and differentiate ourselves from our competitors  such as our various disease management programs 
we expand into contiguous markets through our start ups of new agencies 
expand our referral base 
we have invested considerably in our business development model  through selective hiring and both initial and on going training for our marketing staff  augmented by a marketing department that provides informative and attractive marketing collateral and other marketing support 
this model is focused on increasing admissions as well as expanding our referral base  so that we are not fully dependent on a relatively few physician groups for patient referrals in any given market 
external growth strategy our acquisition strategy includes the following key elements extend our service area in contiguous markets  including new contiguous states as well as further penetrating into certificate of need con states where internal growth opportunities are limited 
we further discuss certificates of need in our government regulation section 
acquire home health care agencies with a strong base of physician referrals 
enhance market share within existing markets 
generate economies of scale through the elimination of duplicate overhead functions 
our primary targets for acquisition include hospital systems with internal home health agencies prospective payment systems pps  which was implemented in october  affected the manner in which hospitals recovered home health care costs under medicare 
as a result  many hospitals made the decision to sell  or are considering  selling their agencies or alternatively  partnering with a reputable company to provide these services 
this not only provides us with the opportunity to acquire quality agencies but also to acquire agencies with a strong base of physician referrals

index to financial statements large  multi site agencies by acquiring multi site agencies and eliminating their corporate structure  we gain economies of scale  more rapidly deploy our business model and enhance market share or expand coverage to markets that are contiguous to existing markets 
local agencies by acquiring smaller local agencies  we can target specific desirable geographic locations to augment our existing service area 
additionally  our more sophisticated business model with respect to disease management  business development  and the utilization of information technology often results in improved operating results  better outcomes and more satisfied referral sources as compared to previous owners operations 
billing and reimbursement revenue generated from our home health care services are paid by medicare  medicaid  private insurance carriers  managed care organizations  other local health insurance programs and private payors 
medicare is a federally funded program available to persons with certain disabilities and persons years of age or older 
we submit all home health medicare claims to one of two federal government fiscal intermediaries  dependent on the geographical location of our agencies 
medicaid  a program jointly funded by federal  state  and local governmental health care programs  is designed to pay for certain health care and medical services provided to low income individuals without regard to age 
we have several contracts for negotiated fees with insurers and managed care organizations 
less than one per cent of our revenue is generated from private payors 
we are highly dependent on medicare reimbursement and a material portion of our business is subject to the government regulation of medicare 
we derived approximately of our net service revenue from the medicare system for each of the years ended december  and and the remaining from medicaid  private insurance companies and private payors 
for a more detailed discussion on medicare reimbursement  refer to our critical accounting policy on medicare revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
information technology we manage our home health care billing and collections through proprietary software 
we have extensively enhanced this software  utilizing employed development staff 
this billing and collection software is combined with both internally developed clinical management software and other externally sourced software and is used throughout our operations 
we intend to continue this development process in order to improve the efficiency and compliance controls of our operations 
in january  we successfully modified our software by implementing a sequel database  which we believe allows more system capacity and therefore  ensures system capacity for growth opportunities 
furthermore  we plan to commence making certain modules of our clinical software available on laptop computers in and to provide such laptop computers to an increasing proportion of our clinical staff 
we believe that a successful implementation of this application will further enhance our compliance controls by having more accurate clinical notes arising from edits that ensure notes are completed in their entirety prior to submission 
we believe that this methodology will improve the quality of our medical records 
industry overview the home health care business revolves around agencies that provide nursing care  drug therapy  rehabilitation and selected other services to about million regular patients according to industry reports 
as 
table of contents 
index to financial statements national health care spending continues to outpace the rate of inflation and the population of older americans increases at a faster rate  we believe that alternatives to costly hospital stays will be in even greater demand 
managed care  medicare  medicaid and other payor pressures continue to drive patients through the continuum of care until they reach a setting where the appropriate level of care can be provided most cost effectively 
over the past several years  home health care has evolved as an acceptable and often preferred alternative in this continuum 
in addition to patient comfort and convenience  substantial cost savings can usually be realized through treatment at home as an alternative to traditional institutional settings 
the continuing economic pressures within the health care industry and the medicare payment system have forced providers of home health care services to closely examine and often modify the manner in which they provide patient care and services 
those companies that successfully operate with effective business models can provide quality patient care and manage costs under the current reimbursement system 
traditionally  the home health care industry has been highly fragmented  comprised primarily of smaller local home health agencies offering limited services 
these local providers often do not have the necessary capital to expand their operations or services and are often not able to achieve the efficiencies necessary to compete effectively 
with the implementation of medicare pps on october   and other legislation  the home health care industry experienced major consolidation for the first time in its history  with industry reports suggesting a reduction from approximately  agencies in to approximately  agencies in competition the home health services industry in which we operate is highly competitive and fragmented 
home healthcare providers range from facility based hospital  nursing home  rehabilitation facility  government agency agencies to independent companies to visiting nurse associations 
they can be not for profit organizations or for profit organizations 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home health services markets in which we operate 
home health care providers compete for referrals based primarily on scope and quality of services  geographic coverage  and pricing and outcomes data 
the impact of competitors is best determined on a market by market basis 
our primary competitors for our home healthcare business are hospital based home health agencies  local home health agencies and visiting nurse associations 
we compete with other home healthcare providers on the basis of availability of personnel  quality and expertise of services and the value and price of services 
we believe that we have a favorable competitive position  attributable mainly to our reputation for over a decade of consistent  high quality care  our comprehensive range of services  our state of the art information management and technology systems  and our widespread service network 
we expect that industry forces will impact us and our competitors 
our competitors will likely strive to improve their service offerings and price competitiveness 
we also expect our competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers  referral sources and payers  which could result in increased competition 
the introduction of new and enhanced services  acquisitions and industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or price competition or make our services less attractive 
seasonality we did not experience a seasonal fluctuation in our home health care or hospice services in although we have experienced a slightly lower demand for those same services from april to september in prior years 
legislation the home health care business is regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
regulations and policies frequently change  and we monitor changes through trade and governmental publications and associations 
our home health care subsidiaries are certified by centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and are

index to financial statements therefore eligible to receive reimbursement for services through the medicare system 
as a provider under the medicare and medicaid systems  we are subject to the various state and federal anti fraud and abuse laws  each of which contains various sanctions  including but not limited to exclusion from further participation in government health care programs 
various federal and state laws impose criminal and civil penalties for submitting false or fraudulent claims for medicare  medicaid or other health care reimbursements 
given the breadth of applicable statutes  government enforcement actions for the submission of false and fraudulent claims may be predicated on any number of alleged schemes 
violations of the anti fraud and abuse laws can result in the imposition of substantial civil and criminal penalties and  potentially  exclusion from furnishing services under any federal health care programs 
we believe that we bill for our services under all state and federal health care programs accurately  although the conditions of participation and associated rules governing coverage of  and reimbursements for  our services are complex 
there can be no assurance that these rules will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our billing practices 
in addition  we are also subject to several major laws related to marketing and business development activities  specifically federal and state anti kickback statutes and the stark self referral law  each of which is described below 
the federal anti kickback laws prohibit any offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce the referral of business reimbursable under a federal health care program or in return for the purchase  lease  order  arranging for  or recommendation of items or services covered by any federal health care programs or any health care plans or programs that are funded  in whole or in part  by the united states government 
a related law forbids the offer or transfer of any item or service for less than fair market value  or certain waivers of co payment obligations  to a beneficiary of medicare or a state health care program that is likely to influence the beneficiary s selection of health care providers 
in addition  the states in which we operate generally have similar anti kickback laws and related statutes that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers where they are designed to obtain the referral of patients to a particular provider 
as with violations of anti fraud and abuse laws  violations of these anti kickback laws can result in the imposition of substantial civil and criminal penalties and  potentially  exclusion from furnishing services under any federal health care programs 
furthermore  as a provider of home health services  we are subject to the stark law which prohibits self referral arrangements 
congress initially adopted legislation in  known as the stark law  to generally prohibit a physician from ordering clinical laboratory services for a medicare beneficiary where the entity providing that service has a financial relationship including direct or indirect ownership or compensation relationships with the physician or a member of his her immediate family  and prohibits such entity from billing for or receiving reimbursement for such services  unless a specified exception is available 
additional legislation became effective as of january   known as stark ii  that extends the stark law prohibitions to services under state medicaid programs  and beyond clinical laboratory services to all designated health services  including but not limited to home health services  although it should be noted that hospice is not deemed a designated health service 
violations of the stark law may also trigger civil monetary penalties and program exclusion 
pursuant to stark ii  physicians who are compensated by us will be prohibited from seeking reimbursement for designated health services rendered to such patients unless an exception applies 
several of the states in which we conduct business have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the federal fraud and abuse laws and the stark laws 
lastly  the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa was enacted on august  to assure health insurance portability  reduce health care fraud and abuse  guarantee security and privacy of health information and enforce standards for health information 
covered entities are required to be in compliance with hipaa provisions relating to security and privacy and may be subject to significant fines and penalties if found not to be compliant with the provisions outlined in the regulations 
regulations issued pursuant 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to hipaa impose ongoing obligations relative to security practices  including electronic records and transactions  and management has implemented processes and procedures to ensure continued compliance with these regulations 
home health care offices have licenses granted by the health authorities of their respective states 
additionally  some state health authorities require a certificate of need con or permit of approval poa to establish and operate a home health care agency 
tennessee  georgia  alabama  north carolina  south carolina  mississippi  maryland  and kentucky require cons  while arkansas requires a poa 
louisiana  oklahoma  virginia  texas and florida currently do not have such requirements 
however  louisiana remains subject to a legislative moratorium on the award of new home health licenses that has been in place for several years  and will continue for the foreseeable future 
in every state  each location license and or con or poa issued by the state health authority determines the service areas for the home health care agency 
in  we discovered questionable conduct involving the former owner of one of our agencies  which occurred between and we voluntarily disclosed the irregularities to the department of health and human services office of the inspector general oig and on august   we signed both a settlement agreement and a corporate integrity agreement with the oig and department of justice  providing for payment of a financial settlement million 
the agreement is binding for a three year period  requires that we maintain our existing compliance program and provides for enhanced training requirements  annual claims audits of the subject agency by an independent reviewer  and regular reporting to the oig 
it provides for stipulated penalties in the event of our non compliance  including the possibility of exclusion from the medicare program 
we believe that these obligations will not materially affect our operations  or financial performance  over the period of the agreement  although no assurances can be provided that the ultimate cost will not be materially different 
management believes we were in compliance with the corporate integrity agreement at december  employees as of december   we had  full time employees  and  part time employees  including part time field nurses and other professionals in the field 
our labor force is not unionized or subject to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our employee relations are good 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health and welfare  workers compensation and professional liability  and while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims  and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on independent actuarial analysis and historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following risks  as well as other information in this filing and the incorporated documents before investing in our common stock 
risks related to our industry our profitability depends principally on the level of government mandated payment rates 
reductions in rates or rate increases that do not cover cost increases may adversely affect our business 
we generally receive fixed payments from medicare for our services based on the level of care that we provide patients 
consequently  our profitability largely depends upon our ability to manage the cost of providing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements services 
although current medicare legislation provides for an annual adjustment of the various payment rates based on the increase or decrease of the medical care expenditure category of the consumer price index  these medicare payment rate increases may be less than actual inflation or could be eliminated or reduced in any given year 
for example  in february  the president of the united states signed into law a bill freezing home health payment rates for the freeze will be effective for one year 
consequently  if our cost of providing services  which consists primarily of labor costs  is greater than the current medicare payment rate  our profitability would be negatively impacted 
specifically regarding our hospice operations  overall payments made by medicare to us for hospice services are subject to two payment limitations hospice caps calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period  which runs from november st of each year though october st of the following year 
under the first limitation  total medicare payments to us per provider number are compared to a cap amount that is calculated by multiplying the number of medicare beneficiaries under that provider number electing hospice care for the first time during the cap period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the cap amount for the twelve month period ending october  was 
we must return any payments in excess of the cap amount to medicare 
our total payment per provider number may be further reduced if any our medicare beneficiaries electing hospice care for the first time are subsequently admitted to another hospice service provider 
the second limitation  which is also calculated on a per provider number basis  provides that reimbursement for any in patient days that exceed of the total in service days for the particular provider number shall be reimbursed at a lower rate 
our ability to avoid these limitations depends on a number of factors  each determined on a provider number basis  including the average length of stay and mix in level of care 
our revenue and profitability associated with our hospice operations may be materially reduced if we are unable to avoid triggering these and other medicare payment limitations 
as we expand our hospice operations  we cannot assure that we will not exceed the cap amounts in the future 
thus  we cannot assure you that these limitations will not negatively affect our profitability on a company wide basis in the future 
further  for our hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state medicaid programs who elect hospice care under medicare or medicaid  the state must pay us  in addition to the applicable medicare or medicaid hospice per diem rate  an amount equal to at least of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursing home 
we contract with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision of certain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide medicaid nursing home patients 
we bill and collect from the applicable state medicaid program an amount equal to at least of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state s medicaid plan 
under our standard nursing home contracts  we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate 
over of our hospice patients reside in nursing homes 
consequently  the reduction or elimination of medicare payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes or any change in our ability to provide service to such patients would significantly reduce the net patient service revenue and profitability related to our hospice operations 
if any of our agencies fail to comply with the conditions of participation in the medicare program  that agency could be terminated from the medicare program  which would adversely affect our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our home care and hospice agencies must comply with the extensive conditions of participation in the medicare program 
if any of our agencies fail to meet any of the medicare conditions of participation  that agency may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that agency then fails to institute a plan of correction to correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor  that agency could be terminated from the medicare program 
any termination of one or more of our home care agencies from the medicare program for failure to satisfy the program s conditions of participation could adversely affect our net service revenue and profitability 
cms has recently announced that it is currently revising the medicare conditions of participation for home health  with publication expected no earlier than spring we do not know at this time what effect the revisions will have on our operations  and there can be no assurances that the revisions will not negatively affect our profitability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are subject to extensive government regulation 
any changes to the laws and regulations governing our business  or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations  could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results 
the federal government and the states in which we operate regulate our industry extensively 
the laws and regulations governing our operations  along with the terms of participation in various government programs  regulate how we do business  the services we offer  and our interactions with patients and the public 
these laws and regulations  and their interpretations  are subject to frequent change 
changes in existing laws and regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or regulations could reduce our profitability by increasing our liability  increasing our administrative and other costs  increasing or decreasing mandated services  forcing us to restructure our relationships with referral sources and providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
for example  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which mandates that provider organizations enhance privacy protections for patient health information 
this requires companies like us to develop  maintain and monitor administrative  information  and security systems to prevent inappropriate release of protected health information 
compliance with this law has added  and will continue to add  costs that affect our profitability 
failure to comply with hipaa could result in fines and penalties  as well as our exclusion from medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  we are subject to various routine and non routine governmental reviews  audits  and investigations 
violation of the laws governing our operations  or changes in interpretations of those laws  could result in the imposition of fines  civil or criminal penalties  the termination of our rights to participate in federal and state sponsored programs  and the suspension or revocation of our licenses 
if we become subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions are imposed on us  we might suffer a substantial reduction in profitability 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our success depends significantly on referrals from physicians  hospitals  and other patient referral sources in the communities that our home care agencies serve  as well as on our ability to maintain good relationships with these referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer home care or hospice patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers 
our growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home care and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets 
our loss of  or failure to maintain  existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations and operate profitably 
we are subject to federal and state laws that govern our financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers  including potential or current referral sources 
we are required to comply with federal and state laws  generally referred to as anti kickback laws  that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between healthcare providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical services 
in addition to enacting anti kickback laws  some of the states in which we operate have enacted laws prohibiting certain business 
table of contents 
index to financial statements relationships between physicians and other providers of healthcare services 
we currently have contractual relationships with certain physicians who provide consulting services to our company 
many of these physicians are current or potential referral sources 
although we believe our physician consultant arrangements currently comply with state and federal anti kickback laws and state laws regulating relationships between healthcare providers  we cannot assure you that courts or regulatory agencies will not interpret these laws in ways that will implicate our physician consultant arrangements 
violations of anti kickback and similar laws could lead to fines or sanctions that may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may be subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims 
the services we offer involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards 
on any given day  we have several hundred nurses and other direct care personnel driving to and from patients homes where they deliver medical and other care 
due to the nature of our business  we and the caregivers who provide services on our behalf may be the subject of medical malpractice claims 
these caregivers could be considered our agents  and  as a result  we could be held liable for their medical negligence 
we cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees 
we maintain malpractice liability insurance and are responsible for amounts in excess of the limits of our coverage 
delays in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems 
our business is characterized by delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these services 
if we have information system problems or issues that arise with medicare  we may encounter delays in our payment cycle 
such a timing delay may cause working capital shortages 
working capital management  including prompt and diligent billing and collection  is an important factor in our results of operations and liquidity 
we cannot assure you that system problems  medicare issues or industry trends will not extend our collection period  adversely impact our working capital  or that our working capital management procedures will successfully negate this risk 
further  our hospice operations bill various state medicaid programs for room and board associated with hospice patients residing in nursing homes 
there are often timing delays when attempting to collect funds from medicaid programs 
we cannot assure you that delays in receiving reimbursement or payments from these programs will not adversely impact our working capital 
our industry is highly competitive 
our home health care agencies compete with local and regional home health care companies  hospitals  nursing homes  and other businesses that provide home nursing services  some of which are large established companies that have significantly greater resources than we do 
our primary competition comes from local companies in each of our markets  and these privately owned or hospital owned health care providers vary by region and market 
we compete based on the availability of personnel  the quality  expertise  and value of our services  and in select instances  on the price of our services 
increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
some of our existing and potential new competitors may enjoy greater name recognition and greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do 
this may permit our competitors to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of services 
these competitors may undertake more far reaching and effective marketing campaigns and may offer more attractive opportunities to existing and potential employees and services to referral sources 
we expect our competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers  referral sources  and payors  which could result in increased competition 
the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings  in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors  could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive 
additionally  we compete with a number of non profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us 
we expect that industry forces will continue to have an impact on our business and that of our competitors 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs  and we expect these cost containment measures to continue in the future 
frequent regulatory changes in our industry  including reductions in reimbursement rates and changes in services covered  have increased competition among home health care providers 
if we are unable to react competitively to new developments  our operating results may suffer 
a shortage of qualified registered nursing staff and other caregivers could adversely affect our ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs 
we rely significantly on our ability to attract and retain caregivers who possess the skills  experience  and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our patients 
we compete for personnel with other providers of home nursing and hospice services 
our ability to attract and retain caregivers depends on several factors  including our ability to provide these caregivers with attractive assignments and competitive benefits and salaries 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in any of these areas 
in addition  there are occasional shortages of qualified healthcare personnel in some of the markets in which we operate 
as a result  we may face higher costs of attracting caregivers and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated  and  if that occurs  our profitability could decline 
finally  although this is currently not a significant factor in our existing markets  if we expand our operations into geographic areas where healthcare providers have historically unionized  we cannot assure you that the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements will not have a negative effect on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel 
generally  if we are unable to attract and retain caregivers  the quality of our services may decline  and we could lose patients and referral sources 
risks related to our business we depend on medicare for substantially all of our revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we received   and  respectively  of our revenue from medicare 
reductions in medicare reimbursement could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
such reductions in payments to us could be caused by administrative or legislative changes to the base episode rate  the elimination or reduction of annual rate increases based on medical inflation  the imposition by medicare of co payments or other mechanisms shifting responsibility for a portion of payment to beneficiaries  adjustments to the relative components of the wage index  changes to our case mix or therapy thresholds  or other adverse changes to the way we are paid for delivering our services 
the medicare payment advisory commission medpac  an independent federal body established to advise congress on issues affecting the medicare program  has recently recommended implementation of pay for performance initiatives for home care providers 
if implemented  medicare will differentiate reimbursement rates for medicare home health service providers based on quality measures 
while we believe that we provide high quality services to our patients  there can be no assurances that a pay for performance reimbursement system will not adversely affect our medicare reimbursement rates and  consequently  our results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our non medicare revenues and profitability also are affected by the continuing efforts of third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care by lowering reimbursement rates  narrowing the scope of covered services  increasing case management review of services  and negotiating reduced contract pricing 
any changes in reimbursement levels from these third party payor sources and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we can provide no assurance that we will continue to maintain the current payor or revenue mix 
migration of our medicare beneficiary patients to medicare managed care providers could negatively impact our operating results 
historically  we have generated the majority of our revenue from the medicare fee for service market 
under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of december mma  however  the united states congress allocated significant additional funds and other incentives to medicare managed care providers in order to promote greater participation in those plans by medicare beneficiaries 
if these increased funding levels have the intended result  the size of the potential medicare fee for service market could decline  thereby reducing the size of our potential patient population  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
we are operating under a corporate integrity agreement 
violations to that agreement could result in penalties or exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in we uncovered certain improprieties stemming from the unauthorized conduct of an agency director in our monroe  louisiana location  an agency we had acquired previously 
we disclosed these improprieties to the office of the inspector general oig 
following an extensive series of audits  we and the oig reached a settlement in august  whereby we agreed to repay approximately million to the government in three annual payments  the last of which we made in august as part of the settlement  we also executed a three year corporate integrity agreement cia  which requires that we maintain our current compliance program  specify additional training requirements  conduct annual  independent audits of the agency  and make timely disclosure of  and repay  overpayments resulting from any potential fraud or abuse of which we become aware 
there are stipulated penalties for violations of the cia 
egregious violations of the cia could result in our exclusion from further participation in government funded health programs 
we have designated a chief compliance officer to ensure ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the cia as well as compliance with all other applicable laws  rules  and regulations 
any acquired businesses are subject to the provisions of the cia 
we believe that we are in compliance with all state and federal fraud and abuse provisions and all other applicable government laws and regulations 
our compliance with these laws and regulations may be subject to future government review and interpretation and possible regulatory actions currently unknown or unasserted 
if we are found to be in violation of any of these provisions  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we operate our agencies under licenses issued and regulated by the respective states in which they are located 
each agency is subject to periodic surveys and complaint based surveys 
if a survey identifies violations of state standards  the agency typically is afforded a grace period in which to comply or otherwise lose its license to operate 
we use a clinical operations department  staffed by regional personnel  to prepare each agency for these surveys and respond when those surveys identify potential problems or when plans of correction are required to bring the agency back into compliance 
if we are found to be in violation of any of these state standards  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our growth strategy depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
our business has grown significantly in size and complexity in recent years 
our internal growth rate for medicare patient admissions was for  for  and for this growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management systems  internal controls  and financial and professional resources 
in addition  we will need to further develop our financial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems  and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and to acquire additional agencies on favorable terms and to integrate and operate these agencies effectively 
if we are unable to do so  our future growth and operating results could be negatively impacted 
developments 
we expect to continue to open agencies in our existing and new markets 
our new agency growth  however  will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain locations for agencies in markets where need exists  identify and hire a sufficient number of appropriately trained home care and other health care professionals  obtain adequate financing to fund growth  and operate successfully under applicable government regulations 
acquisitions 
we are focusing significant time and resources on the acquisition of home healthcare providers  or of certain of their assets  in targeted markets 
we may be unable to identify  negotiate  and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on reasonable terms 
we may incur future liabilities related to acquisitions 
should any of the following problems  or others  occur as a result of our acquisition strategy  the impact could be material difficulties integrating personnel from acquired entities and other corporate cultures into our business  difficulties integrating information systems  the potential loss of key employees or referral sources of acquired companies or a reduction in patient referrals by hospitals from which we have acquired home health care agencies  the assumption of liabilities and exposure to undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies  the acquisition of an agency with undisclosed compliance problems  the diversion of management attention from existing operations  difficulties in recouping partial episode payments and other types of misdirected payments for services from the previous owners  or an unsuccessful claim for indemnification rights from previous owners for acts or omissions arising prior to the date of acquisition 
our acquisitions may impose strains on our existing resources 
as a result of our past and current acquisition strategy  we have grown significantly over the last two years 
as we continue to add acquisition related revenue and expand our markets  our growth could strain our resources  including management  information systems  regulatory compliance  logistics  and other controls 
we cannot assure you that our resources will keep pace with our anticipated growth 
if we do not manage our expected growth effectively  our future results could be adversely affected 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may face increasing competition for acquisition candidates 
we intend to grow significantly through the continued acquisition of additional home nursing agencies 
we face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
recently  we have observed an increase in acquisition prices for mid sized and larger regional home health care companies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions in the future or that any such opportunities  if identified  will be consummated on favorable terms  if at all 
in the absence of completing successful acquisitions  our future growth rate could decline 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any future acquisitions  if consummated  will result in further growth 
we may require additional capital to pursue our acquisition strategy 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
based on our current plan of operations  including acquisitions  we cannot assure you that this amount will be sufficient to support our current growth strategies 
we cannot readily predict the timing  size  and success of our acquisition efforts and the associated capital commitments 
if we do not have sufficient cash resources  our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing 
effective as of july   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with wachovia bank  na the facility includes a million term loan and up to million in a three year revolver  of which million was outstanding as of december  our business depends on our information systems 
our inability to effectively integrate  manage  and keep secure our information systems could disrupt our operations 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing claims  reporting financial results  measuring outcomes and quality of care  managing regulatory compliance controls  and maintaining operational efficiencies 
these systems include software developed in house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers 
to the extent that these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems  our operations could be negatively affected 
our agencies also depend upon our information systems for accounting  billing  collections  risk management  quality assurance  payroll  and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement  maintain  or expand our systems properly  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  regulatory problems  and increases in administrative expenses 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and patient data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented 

table of contents 
index to financial statements further  our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
a failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  loss of electronically stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
our clinical software system has been developed in house 
failure of  or problems with  our system could harm our business and operating results 
we have developed and utilize a proprietary windows based clinical software system to collect assessment data  schedule and log patient visits  generate medical orders  and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards 
the system integrates billing and collections functionality as well as accounting  human resource  payroll  and employee benefits programs provided by third parties 
problems with  or the failure of  our technology and systems could negatively impact data capture  billing  collections  and management and reporting capabilities 
any such problems or failures could adversely affect our operations and reputation  result in significant costs to us  and impair our ability to provide our services in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any errors or problems may be substantial and could adversely affect our profitability 
we depend on outside software providers 
we depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating our business  some of which are provided by outside software providers 
these information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading  and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
if our providers are unable to maintain or expand our information systems properly  we could suffer from operational disruptions and an increase in administrative expenses  among other things 
our insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs 
we maintain professional liability insurance for amedisys and our subsidiaries 
however  we cannot assure you that claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of such insurance  if any  nor can we assure you that any such claims  if successful and in excess of such limits  will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business or on our assets 
our insurance coverage also includes fire  property damage  and general liability with varying limits 
although we maintain insurance consistent with industry practice  we cannot assure you that the insurance we maintain will satisfy claims made against us 
in addition  as a result of operating in the home healthcare industry  our business entails an inherent risk of claims  losses and potential lawsuits alleging employee accidents that are likely to occur in a patient s home 
finally  we cannot assure you that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates  in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms 
any claims made against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could damage our reputation and business 
from december  to november   we were insured for risks associated with professional and general liability by an insurance company that currently is in liquidation under federal bankruptcy laws and may not be able to pay or defend claims incurred by us during this period  and our current insurance does not cover any such claims 
we do not  however  believe that the ultimate resolution of current claims will be materially different from reserves established for them or that any material claims will be made in the future based on occurrences during that period 
we have established reserves for medicare liabilities that may be payable by us in the future 
these liabilities may be subject to audit or further review  and we may owe additional amounts beyond what we expect and have reserved for 
as of december   we have estimated an aggregate payable to medicare of million  all of which is reflected as a current liability in our financial statements 
the million liability has two 
table of contents 
index to financial statements components a cost report adjustments reserve million  and a medicare prospective payment system pps payment adjustments reserve million 
if actual amounts exceed our reserves  we may incur additional costs that may adversely affect our results of operations 
we describe these adjustments below 
cost report adjustments reserve 
prior to the implementation of pps on october   we recorded medicare revenue at the lower of actual costs  the per visit cost limit  or a per beneficiary cost limit on an individual provider basis 
we determined ultimate reimbursement upon review of annual cost reports 
the recorded million includes a million obligation of a wholly owned subsidiary that is currently in bankruptcy  and it is not clear whether we will have any responsibility for that amount if the debt of the subsidiary is discharged in bankruptcy 
also included in the balance is million that reflects our estimate of amounts likely to be assessed by medicare as overpayments in respect of prior years when medicare audits of our cost reports through october are completed 
at the time when these audits are completed and final assessments are issued  we may apply to medicare for repayment  if appropriate  over a thirty six month period  although there is no assurance that such applications will be agreed to  if sought 
these amounts relate to the medicare payment system in effect until october  under which medicare provided periodic interim payments to us  subject to audit of cost reports submitted by us and repayment of any overpayments by medicare to us 
the fiscal intermediary  acting on behalf of medicare  has not yet issued finalized audits with respect to and and is entitled to reopen settled cost reports for up to three years after issuing final assessments 
the remaining balance of million is related to notice from cms that it intended to make certain recoveries of amounts overpaid to providers for the periods dating from the implementation of pps on october  through particular dates in and the first of these amounts related to partial episode payments peps whereby a patient was readmitted to home health care prior to the expiry of days from the previous admission date at another home health agency 
in such instances  reimbursement for the first agency is reduced 
cms advised the industry that cms had implemented changes to its computer system such that these instances would be adjusted at the time of claim submission on an ongoing basis  and that recovery for prior overpayments would commence in the summer of and extend over a two year period 
medicare completed its recoveries of peps on september  we increased our medicare revenue in the fourth quarter of in the amount of million for reserves in excess of monies recouped by medicare 
secondly  cms advised the industry that it would seek recovery of overpayments that were made for patients who had  within days of such admission  been discharged from inpatient facilities  including hospitals  rehabilitation and skilled nursing units 
we continue to evaluate this liability and estimated a reserve in the amount of approximately million was appropriate as of december  we depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team  including our chairman and chief executive officer  william f 
borne  our president and chief operating officer  larry r 
graham  our chief financial officer  gregory h 
browne  and our chief information officer  alice a 
schwartz 
we also depend upon the continued employment of the senior vice presidents that manage several of our key functional areas  including operations  business development  accounting  finance  human resources  marketing  information systems  contracting and compliance 
we maintain key employee life insurance of million on mr 
borne s life and have entered into employment agreements with each of mr

our operations could be affected by natural disasters 
a substantial number of our agencies are located in the southeastern united states and the gulf coast region  increasing our exposure to hurricanes and other natural disasters 
the occurrence of natural disasters in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the markets in which we operate could not only affect the day to day operations of our agencies  but also could also disrupt our relationships with patients  employees and referral sources located in the affected areas 
in addition  any episode of care that is not completed due to the impact of a natural disaster will generally result in lower revenue for the episode 
for example  in late august and early september  hurricanes katrina and rita impacted our agencies  employees and patients located in southern louisiana and southern mississippi 
to date  only one of our agencies affected by hurricanes katrina and rita  located in chalmette  louisiana  has not reopened 
other of our agencies located in the louisiana gulf coast region  however  have been operating at lower capacities 
we cannot assure you that hurricanes or other natural disasters will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
we are defending class action lawsuits that may require us to pay substantial damage awards 
on august and october   two class action lawsuits were filed  which have since been consolidated  on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock between november  and june   against us and three of our executive officers  in the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana 
in may of  the trial court certified the class  and we appealed that decision 
on february   the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit vacated the trial court s certification order and remanded the case for further proceedings relative to class certification 
the parties have agreed to a stay of all depositions and other discovery subject to certain limited exceptions pending a ruling on class certification 
the suits seek damages based on the decline in our stock price following an announced restatement of earnings for the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  alleging that our management knew or were reckless in not knowing the facts giving rise to the restatement 
we are vigorously defending these lawsuits 
we have directors and officers insurance coverage for an amount in excess of  up to million  in respect of this period 
we are not able to estimate at this time the potential amounts that could be awarded to the plaintiffs in this matter 
although management believes our insurance coverage is sufficient in respect to any amounts that may be awarded  we cannot assure you that the final resolution will fall within our insurance coverage amounts 
we have met our deductible with the legal fees that have been incurred to date 
additional legal fees will be paid by the insurer up to our policy limits 
there is a risk that we will be held responsible for some or all of the million liability of a bankrupt subsidiary 
we consolidate the net liabilities of alliance  a bankrupt subsidiary that is no longer in operation  in our consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that we could be held responsible for some or all of this amount  and  depending upon the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings  potentially a larger amount 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders 
the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities  particularly securities of health care companies 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including our operating and financial performance  variances in our quarterly financial results compared to research analyst expectations  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur  investor perception of our business and our prospects  
table of contents

in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market in particular  has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of health care provider companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the availability of those shares for future sale  could adversely affect our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital 
at december    shares of our common stock were outstanding

as of december    shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of stock options which were outstanding but not exercisable   shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of stock options which were outstanding and exercisable  and  shares of our common stock were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or the perception that substantial sales could occur 
these sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell common stock in the future to raise capital 
we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  and you should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our common stock 
we do not pay dividends and intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business 
in addition  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements  earnings  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
under the terms of our credit facility  we are restricted from paying cash dividends and making other cash distributions to our stockholders 
our board of directors may use anti takeover provisions or issue stock to discourage control contests 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to million shares of common stock and million shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors may cause us to issue additional stock to discourage an attempt to obtain control of the company 
for example  shares of stock could be sold to purchasers who might support the board of directors in a control contest or to dilute the voting or other rights of a person seeking to obtain control 
in addition  the board of directors could cause us to issue preferred stock entitling holders to vote separately on any proposed transaction  convert preferred stock into common stock  demand redemption at a specified price in connection with a change in control  or exercise other rights designed to impede a takeover 
in addition  the issuance of additional shares may  among other things  dilute the earnings and equity per share of our common stock and the voting rights of common stockholders 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we have implemented other anti takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti takeover effect  including advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals and a stockholder rights plan  also known as a poison pill 
these provisions  and others that the board of directors may adopt hereafter  may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our board of directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us  even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock 
therefore  our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control

management believes we were in compliance with the corporate integrity agreement at december  in november  we elected to terminate our asset financing facility with npf vi 
the decision to terminate the facility was made in response to the failure of npf vi to honor our request to remit million in funds being held on our behalf in accordance with the terms of the facility 
at that date  we determined that an amount of approximately million was being held on behalf of us by npf vi and  in response  engaged in correspondence with representatives of npf vi in an effort to have these funds returned

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amedisys  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in these consolidated financial statements 
business combinations accounted for as purchases are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
revenues we earn revenues through our home health care and hospice agencies by providing a variety of services in the homes of our patients 
we are dependent on reimbursement from medicare for a significant portion of our revenues 
we derived approximately of our net service revenue from the medicare system and the remaining from medicaid  private insurance companies and private payors for each of the years ended december  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements medicare revenue recognition on october   medicare began paying providers of home health care at fixed  predetermined rates for services and supplies bundled into day episodes of home health care 
an episode of home health care spans a day period  starting with the first day a billable visit is furnished to a medicare beneficiary and ending days later 
if a patient is still in treatment on the th day a new episode begins on the st day regardless of whether a billable visit is rendered on that day and ends days later 
the first day of a consecutive episode  therefore  is not necessarily the new episode s first billable visit 
a base episode payment is established by the medicare program through federal legislation for all episodes of care ended on or after the applicable time periods detailed below period base episode payment october  through september  october  through march  april  through december  january  through december  the actual episode payment rates  as presented in the table vary  depending on the home health resource groups hhrgs to which medicare patients are assigned and the per episode payment is typically reduced or increased by such factors as the patient s clinical  functional  and services utilization characteristics 
under the prospective payment system pps for medicare reimbursement  net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate that varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and other factors 
net revenues are recorded as services are rendered to patients over the day episode period 
at the end of each month  a portion of our revenue is estimated for episodes in progress 
medicare reimbursement  on an episodic basis  is subject to adjustment if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
revenue recognition under the medicare reimbursement program is based on certain variables including  but not limited  to i changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  ii adjustments to the base episode payments for partial episodes and for other factors  such as case mix  geographic wages  low utilization and intervening events  and  iii recoveries of overpayments 
adjustments to revenue result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue recognition for episodes in progress is estimated based upon historical trends 
we continuously compare the estimated medicare reimbursement amounts recorded to the actual medicare reimbursement received 
historically  any difference between estimated amounts recorded and actual amounts received from medicare has been immaterial 
management believes based on information available and our judgment that changes to one or more of the factors that impact the accounting estimate  which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact either our reported financial results  our liquidity or our future financial results 
the main impact would be current legislation impacting our reimbursement rates 
we are currently unaware of any such proposals 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program was included as a reduction to our accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively  since only a nominal amount of deferred revenue represents cash collected in advance of providing services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements hospice revenue recognition hospice is generally billed to medicare weekly for discharged patients and monthly for ongoing care 
each hospice provider is subject to payment caps for inpatient services  and the cap is based on inpatient days which cannot exceed of all medicare hospice days 
overall medicare reimbursement is also subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of each hospice cap period 
on a monthly and quarterly basis  we estimate our potential cap exposure using information available for both inpatient day limits as well as per beneficiary cap amounts 
the total cap amount for each provider is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory amount that is indexed for inflation 
the per beneficiary cap amount was  and  for the twelve month periods ending october  and  respectively 
any amounts received in excess of the per beneficiary cap must be refunded to medicare within fifteen days 
we have settled all years through october  without exceeding any of the cap limits and we believe that  based upon our calculations and historical experience  we have not exceeded any of the cap limits and will have no amounts due the fiscal intermediary for the cap period ending october   which is expected to be settled in the second quarter of management believes that changes to one or more of the factors that impact the accounting estimate for hospice revenue  which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact either our reported financial results  our liquidity or our future financial results 
medicaid revenue recognition medicaid  a program jointly funded by federal  state  and local governmental health care programs  is designed to pay for certain health care and medical services provided to low income individuals without regard to age 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided 
private insurance companies and private payor revenue recognition we have entered into agreements with third party payors that provide payments for services rendered at amounts different from established rates 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated reimbursement rates  as applicable 
allowances and contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between the established rates and the amounts estimated to be payable by third parties and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue 
net service revenue is the estimated net amounts realizable from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements 
revenue is recorded as services are rendered and is based upon discounts from established rates 
we receive less than one percent of our net revenues from private payors and self pay patients 
collectibility of accounts receivable in the year ended december   our accounts receivable increased  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  to million from million at december  this increase  which also resulted in an increase to our days revenue outstanding  was due to the increases in net service revenue primarily as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions and to delays in billing associated with our acquisitions  particularly with respect to our hospice acquisitions 
as a result of the significant acquisitions in the latter half of  our net revenues increased to million from million for the period july to december for the years ended and  respectively  which also accounts for the accounts receivable growth 
we have experienced an increase in days revenue outstanding that primarily related to conversion issues surrounding our housecall acquisition including conforming billing processes and procedures 
in addition  we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements experienced delays in having the change of ownership from our spectracare acquisition recognized by medicare which has resulted in delays of our ability to receive reimbursement for services provided 
finally  our hospice reimbursement  which is now a larger portion of our outstanding accounts receivable  is generally subject to slower cash realization in comparison to our home health agencies 
the following schedule details our accounts receivable by payor class dollars in thousands current over total december  medicare medicaid private total allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable days revenue outstanding days december  medicare medicaid private total allowance for doubtful accounts net accounts receivable days revenue outstanding days there was million and million pending approval of the change of ownership by the center for medicare services cms as of december  and  respectively 
we believe all amounts to be collectible 
due to our significant acquisitions and our internal growth  our calculation for days revenue outstanding is derived by dividing the ending gross accounts receivables at december  and by the average daily net patient revenues for the three month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the process for estimating the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable involves judgment  with the greatest subjectivity relating to non medicare accounts receivable 
we currently record an allowance for uncollectible accounts on a percentage of earned revenue basis unless a specific issue is noted  at which time an adjustment to the allowance may be recorded 
the percentage of revenue that we reserve is significantly higher for medicaid  private insurance and self pay patients than for medicare and is based upon historical collection experience 
our collection process begins with a concerted effort to ensure that our billing is accurate 
we derived approximately of our net service revenue from the medicare system for each of the years ended december  and with a cash collection realization on medicare receivables 
our pre billing process includes an electronic medicare claim review referred to as a scrubber to improve the quality of filed claims data in an effort to reduce the volume of collection effort on these accounts 
non medicare accounts are billed based upon payor requirements and include multiple third party payors 
we routinely perform pre billing reviews to improve the quality of filed claims and have installed multiple checkpoints when claims are not processed timely

index to financial statements determine why payment has not been made and claims are resubmitted if necessary 
collections personnel also bill patients for any co payments and make a good faith effort to collect these amounts 
there are a very small number of contracts that require a patient co payment 
if a claim has been denied  an appeal is filed with the payor 
if  through individual review of accounts  it is determined that all efforts have been exhausted a write off is generated 
we have historically elected not to litigate uncollected self pay amounts but may do so in the future 
we have authorizations required to initiate and post these write offs to our system 
accounts are written off against the allowance only when all collection efforts have been exhausted and such determination may take up to months 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including workers compensation  employee health and welfare and professional liability  and while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
we have engaged an independent actuarial firm to assist us in the quantification of losses associated with our incurred but not reported claims 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
our worker compensation plan has a  deductible per claim  and we have elected to either fund our carrier with a letter of credit or a deposit for the purpose of guaranteeing the payment of claims 
our deposits may be depleting or non depleting 
a depleting deposit allows the carrier to draw upon the funds in order to pay the claims 
where we have provided a non depleting deposit  the carrier invoices us each month for reimbursement of claims that they have paid 
for carriers funded by a letter of credit and carriers where our deposit is deemed not sufficient to satisfy our total estimated obligation  we record an accrued liability for the portion of the estimated obligation that exceeds the amount of cash held by the carrier 
for the years ended december  and  deposits on hand at the carriers net of claims already paid was million and million respectively and outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and million  respectively 
in addition  for the years ended december  and  our accrual for estimated liabilities was million and million  respectively 
the increases were primarily the result of our acquisitions 
we are self insured for health claims up to contractual policy limits 
claims in excess of  per incident are insured by third party reinsurers 
we had accrued a liability of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  for both outstanding and incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience 
we maintain professional liability insurance coverage for medical malpractice with aggregate annual limits of million and a deductible of  per occurrence 
effective august  we increased the limits on our excess liability policy  which has a  deductible  to million from million 
we maintain directors and officers insurance and effective july  increased our annual aggregate limits to million from million 
in the case of potential liability with respect to professional liability  employment and other matters where litigation may be involved  or where no insurance coverage is available  our policy is to use advice from both internal and external counsel as to the likelihood and amount of any potential cost 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
we maintained reserves for all legal claims including an amount for professional liability claims incurred but not yet reported of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
while we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  there can be no assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or in excess of our insurance limits

the impairment analysis requires numerous subjective assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of the respective reporting units as required by sfas no 
as of december   we completed our quarterly impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required

income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
medicare settlement issues prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home care nursing services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports that were filed with the cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
included in our reserves is an obligation of a wholly owned subsidiary that is currently in bankruptcy  and it is not clear whether we will have any responsibility for that amount if the debt of the subsidiary is discharged in bankruptcy 
although we believe that established reserves are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits and the final resolution of our potential obligation related to the bankruptcy could result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements that are different from our established reserves

we have been subject to some interest rate risk on our senior secured borrowings and could be subject to interest rate risk on any future floating rate financing
