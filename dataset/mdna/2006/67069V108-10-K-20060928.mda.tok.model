the company s therapeutic strategy continues to include a commitment to spending on research and development and is targeted at further validating earlier findings focused on disease specific conditions in the areas of diabetes and depression 
future research and development expenses should be partially offset by an increased number of clinical studies that are being funded by the national institutes of health nih to further confirm the role of chromium picolinate in treating various health conditions 
in fiscal year  the company entered into an agreement with xlhealth  formerly known as diabetex corporation  a diabetes disease management company  to fund a patient double blind placebo controlled trial to evaluate diachrome s effect as a nutritional adjunct to standard care for people with diabetes

these large scale studies are being conducted to secure medical acceptance and adoption for the company s products as standard treatment protocols 
the company s spending in these areas of new technology is discretionary and is subject to the availability of funds 
there can be no assurances that the company s disease specific product development efforts will be successfully completed or that the products will be successfully manufactured or marketed

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company carries inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management write downs may be required 
property  plant and equipment  patents  trademarks and other intangible assets owned by the company are amortized  over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates over the period that such assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying capital investments or intangible assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of such assets  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
when customers have rights to return products  the company defers revenue recognition until its customer sells the product to the end user 
upon shipment by the company  amounts billed to customers with rights to product returns are included as accounts receivable  inventory is relieved  the sale is deferred and the gross profit is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold to the end user
