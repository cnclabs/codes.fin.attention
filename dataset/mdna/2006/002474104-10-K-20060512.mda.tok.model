item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we operate two distinct segments  the electrical and industrial products segment and the galvanizing services segment 
the electrical and industrial products segment serves the power generation  transmission and distribution markets as well as the general industrial market 
the galvanizing services segment consists of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities located throughout the south and southwest united states that provide galvanizing service to the steel fabrication industry 
for the fiscal year ended february   we recorded revenues of million compared to the prior year s revenues of million 
approximately of our revenues were generated from the electrical and industrial products segment and approximately were generated from the galvanizing services segment 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million in the fiscal net income as a percentage of sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal earnings per share increased by to per share for fiscal compared to 
per share in fiscal  on a diluted basis 
results of operations year ended february  compared with year ended february  management believes that analyzing our revenue and operating income by segment is the most meaningful analysis of our results of operations 
segment operating income consists of net sales less cost of sales  specifically identifiable selling  general and administrative expenses  and other income expense items that are specifically identifiable to a segment 
the other income expense items included in segment operating income are generally insignificant 
for a reconciliation of segment operating income to pretax income  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenues our operations ended fiscal with a backlog of million  an increase of as compared to fiscal backlog of million 
our book to ship ratio was to for fiscal as compared to to in the prior year 
in fiscal  we continued our efforts to improve our market coverage and expand our served markets 
the increased backlog was the result of increased orders for our high voltage transmission products both domestically and internationally  as well as increased orders from the domestic industrial market 
these improvements in our backlog were partially offset by a decline in our distribution products backlog 
in general  the market indicators and the dollar value of quotation levels suggest that some of our markets continue to show improvement  while others have stabilized 
the following table reflects bookings and shipments for fiscal and backlog table in thousands period ending period ending backlog bookings shipments backlog book to ship ratio the following table reflects the breakdown of revenue by segment in thousands revenue electrical and industrial products galvanizing services total revenue our consolidated net revenues for fiscal increased by million or  as compared to fiscal the electrical and industrial products segment produces highly engineered specialty products supplied to the power generation  power transmission  power distribution and general industrial markets as well as lighting and tubular products to the industrial and petroleum markets 
the segment recorded revenues for fiscal of million  an increase of above the fiscal results of million 
the increased revenue resulted primarily from increased demand for our products in the high voltage transmission and industrial markets  particularly the petroleum sector 
the increased demand continues to be partially offset by lower demand for the power generation market 
the passage of the energy legislation has and we believe will continue to have a positive impact on this segment 
there are incentives  reliability standards  and programs to promote alternative energy sources  which should continue to enhance customer spending 
continued improvements in capital spending and a continuation of the plus industrial utilization levels as reported by the federal reserve should sustain improved operating levels from the industrial market 
our galvanizing services segment  which is made up of eleven hot dip galvanizing facilities  generated revenues of million  a increase from the prior year s revenues of million 
the increased revenue resulted from a improvement in pricing and a increase in the pounds of steel produced in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in volume was due to improvements in all of our markets 
during the latter half of fiscal  this segment benefited from increased work related to the rebuilding of the gulf coast area 
table of contents due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
revenues for this segment have historically followed the condition of the general industrial economy 
segment operating income the following table reflects the breakdown of total operating income by segment in thousands segment operating income electrical and industrial products galvanizing services total segment operating income total segment operating income see note to notes to consolidated financial statements increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal consolidated operating margins as a percentage of sales improved to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the improvement resulted primarily from leverage obtained from increased revenues and improved pricing levels 
we continue to place emphasis on systems and procedures and the sharing of best practices among our operations to further enhance operating efficiency 
the electrical and industrial products segment generated of the operating income for fiscal  while the galvanizing services segment produced the remaining 
operating income for the electrical and industrial products segment increased million or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for fiscal operating margins for this segment were for fiscal as compared to for fiscal operating margins were favorably impacted by improved pricing levels  as a result of our minimum acceptable margin initiative for fiscal  and leverage obtained by increased revenues 
operating efficiencies and leverage obtained from increased revenues during fiscal were partially offset by increased material costs  primarily copper  aluminum  and steel 
although price levels improved  we were still unable to fully recoup these costs through price increases to our customers 
we continue to align and consolidate resources to match current market conditions  while still maintaining our ability to capitalize on opportunities that arise 
despite improved market conditions  we believe that we will continue to see very competitive pricing in fiscal due to the industry s excess capacity 
operating income for the galvanizing service segment increased million or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for the prior year 
the operating income improvement was attributable to a increase in revenues 
operating margins improved to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the improvement in operating margins resulted from increased selling prices and leverage obtained through increased revenues 
during fiscal  this segment sustained significant damage at several operations as a result of hurricanes in the gulf coast area 
property damage associated with the hurricanes resulted in a reduction in carrying value of the affected assets in the amount of  which was netted against replacement cost insurance proceeds in the amount of  after deductibles 
this netted a gain in the amount of  which was included in operating income for the segment 
subsequent to fiscal  we received additional proceeds from our insurance provider in the amount of  which will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal additional proceeds will be recorded in the future for property damage as these amounts are determined and the cash is received 
we also recognized insurance settlements from business interruption insurance in the amount of  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal to recover a portion of the fixed cost related to lost production days 
the recent metal commodity pricing  including the cost of zinc  continues to be a concern 
the increase in zinc costs could have a significant impact on margins if economic factors inhibit our ability to pass this increased cost on to our customers 
we have increased pricing in concert with the increased costs of zinc and will continue increased pricing to offset continued cost escalation 
as a result of increased pricing  there is the possibility that we could reach some point where customers begin to 
table of contents seek alternatives to galvanizing  or delay or cancel projects 
the increasing cost of zinc is a critical factor that impacts all participants in the hot dip galvanizing industry 
general corporate expense general corporate expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  general corporate expenses were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal included in general corporate expense in fiscal is million related to the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley and compensation expense related to stock appreciation rights in the amount of  interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of as compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from significant increases in interest rates on our variable debt instruments 
the increase in interest rates was partially offset by debt reduction of million during fiscal our total outstanding bank debt was million at the end of  a decrease of as compared to million at the end of fiscal our long term debt to equity ratio improved to 
to for fiscal as compared to 
to for fiscal other income expense for fiscal and  the amounts in other income expense see note of notes to consolidated financial statements were insignificant 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we benefited from the american jobs creation act of  which allows a deduction from income tax for qualified domestic production activities 
benefits from the new domestic manufacturing deduction were offset by higher state income taxes due to differences in the mix of profits generated from our operating facilities located in varying tax jurisdictions 
year ended february  compared with year ended february  revenues our operations ended fiscal with a backlog of million  an increase of as compared to fiscal backlog of million 
the segment recorded a book to ship ratio of to for fiscal as compared to to in the prior year 
the backlog continued to be heavily weighted towards the distribution market in fiscal the following table reflects bookings and shipments for the compared periods of fiscal and backlog table in thousands period ending period ending backlog bookings shipments backlog book to ship ratio 
table of contents the following table reflects the breakdown of revenue by segment in thousands revenue electrical and industrial products galvanizing services total revenue our consolidated net revenues for fiscal increased by million or  as compared to fiscal the electrical and industrial products segment recorded revenues for fiscal of million  an increase of above our fiscal results of million 
the increased revenue resulted primarily from increased demand for our products in the power distribution and petroleum markets 
while these markets showed improvement  the revenue contribution from the industrial market was below expectations due to extreme pricing pressure that caused us to decline certain projects due to unacceptable pricing levels 
our galvanizing services segment generated revenues of million  a increase from the prior year s revenues of million 
the increase in volume was due to the improved geographical markets in which our facilities are located and the resurgence of galvanizing for the telecommunication markets 
segment operating income the following table reflects the breakdown of total operating income by segment in thousands segment operating income electrical and industrial products galvanizing services total segment operating income total segment operating income increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal consolidated operating margins were consistent for the compared periods at 
in fiscal  we continued to place emphasis on systems and procedures and the sharing of best practices among our operations to further enhance operating efficiency 
the electrical and industrial products segment generated of the operating income for fiscal  while the galvanizing services segment produced the remaining 
operating income for the electrical and industrial products segment increased 
million or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for fiscal operating margins for this segment were unchanged at for the compared years 
operating efficiencies and leverage obtained from increased revenues during fiscal were offset by increased material costs  primarily copper  aluminum  and steel 
operating income for the galvanizing service segment increased 
million or for fiscal  to million as compared to million for the prior year 
this segment benefited from the sizing of its operations to match market conditions 
operating margins were consistent at for fiscal and the additional margin obtained from the resizing of the organization and the leverage achieved from increased revenue were offset by the increased commodity cost of zinc 
general corporate expense general corporate expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal as a percentage of sales  general corporate expenses were for fiscal as compared to in fiscal 
table of contents the percentage increase results in part from implementation cost of oracle s erp system that could not be capitalized and sarbanes oxley compliance cost  which combined totaled  for fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from reductions of our average outstanding debt throughout fiscal we ended fiscal with outstanding bank debt of million  a decrease of or million as compared to the million outstanding at the end of fiscal our long term debt to equity ratio improved to 
to for fiscal as compared to 
to for fiscal other income expense for fiscal the amounts in other income expense see note of notes to consolidated financial statements were insignificant 
fiscal included the amount of  for gain on the sale of vacant land  which was not specifically identifiable to a segment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate of for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax resulted from a difference in the mix of profits generated from our operating facilities located in varying tax jurisdictions  which impacted our effective tax rate for current and deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically met cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank borrowings 
our cash requirements are generally for operating activities  capital improvements  debt repayment and acquisitions 
we believe that working capital  borrowing capabilities  and funds generated from operations should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements  and payment of debt and possible future acquisitions 
our operating activities generated cash flows of approximately million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
cash flow from operations in fiscal included net income in the amount of million  depreciation and amortization of intangibles and interest expense related to debt issue costs in the amount of million  and net changes in operating assets and liabilities and other increases in cash flows from operations of a negative 
million 
due to increased business levels in both our segments  our working capital requirements were increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the increased levels of business  accounts receivable  inventories  and prepaid and other assets balances increased by million  million  and 
million  respectively in fiscal over accounts receivable days outstanding for fiscal were days as compared to days in fiscal inventory turns were times for fiscal as compared to times in fiscal the decrease in cash flow from increases in accounts receivable  inventories  and prepaid and other asset balances was partially offset by increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and net changes in billings related to costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in the amount of million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  cash flow from operations was used to make capital improvements of million and to reduce debt by million 
the breakdown of capital spending by segment for fiscal   and can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received proceeds from the sale of or insurance settlement on property and equipment in the amount of 
million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the amount of million 
there were no cash dividends declared or paid in fiscal  and no resumption of a cash dividend is currently anticipated 
on november   we entered into an amended and restated revolving and term loan credit agreement the credit agreement  which replaced the previous term notes and revolving line of credit 

table of contents the new agreement included a million term facility and a million revolving credit facility 
since november   we amended the credit agreement to reduce the number of banks participating from five to three banks  reduced the revolving credit facility from million to million  extended the maturity of the revolving line of credit to june   extended the maturity and amortization of the term facility to march   and revised the provisions of various financial covenants 
these financial covenants consist of minimum consolidated net worth maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
as of february   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
the availability under the revolving credit facility is contingent on asset based collateral of inventories and accounts receivables 
at february   we had million outstanding under the term note and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the remaining balance outstanding on the term note is payable in quarterly installments of million through march at february   we had approximately million of additional credit available under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the term note and revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the lesser of the base rate plus the applicable margin for the base rate borrowings for the applicable facility  or the adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin for eurodollar rate borrowings for the applicable facility 
the applicable margin range is based on the leverage ratio 
the applicable margin was at february   and correlated to an interest rate of on the hedged portion of the note after hedging as discussed below and on the variable portion of the note at february  additionally  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee based on the leverage ratio at a rate ranging from 
to 
on the unused revolving credit facility 
we utilize interest rate protection agreements to moderate the effects of increases  if any  in interest rates by modifying the characteristics of our interest obligations on long term debt from a variable rate to a fixed rate 
presently  we have one outstanding interest rate swap 
in march  we entered into an interest rate protection agreement the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of our variable interest expense related to the term note 
under the swap agreement  we exchange interest rate obligations from march  through march  by paying a fixed rate of for variable day libor plus at february  
the notional amount of this swap matures in stages 
as of february   the remaining notional amount was million and matures on march  to date  there has been no ineffectiveness related to the swap agreement 
at february   the fair value of the swap agreement was an asset of  a gain of  net of tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
our current ratio current assets current liabilities was to at the end of fiscal  as compared to to at the end of fiscal shareholder equity grew during fiscal to million or per share shareholders equity weighted average shares outstanding at february  
long term debt as a percentage of shareholders equity ratio was 
to at the end of fiscal as compared to 
to at the end of fiscal the decrease in long term debt to shareholders equity ratio was the result of a reduction in debt of million and increased shareholders equity of million 
the funds used for debt repayment came from cash flows generated from operations 
we have not experienced significant impacts on our operations from increases in general inflation other than for specific commodities and employee health care costs 
we have exposure to commodity price increases in both segments of our business  primarily zinc in the galvanizing services segment and copper  aluminum and steel in the electrical and industrial products segment 
we attempt to minimize these increases through protective caps purchased on zinc and escalation clauses in customer contracts for copper  aluminum and steel  when market conditions allow 
in addition to these measures  we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing process and through increases in prices where competitively feasible 
off balance sheet transactions and related matters there are no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  or other relationships of the company with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have  or may have  a 
table of contents material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual commitments leases the company leases various facilities under non cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year 
as of february   the future minimum payments required under these operating leases are summarized in the below table 
rental expense for real estate and personal property was approximately   and  for fiscal years ended  and  respectively  and includes all short term as well as long term rental agreements 
commodity pricing the company manages its exposures to commodity prices through the use of the following 
in the electrical and industrial products segment  the company has exposure to commodity pricing for copper  aluminum  and steel 
because the electrical and industrial products segment does not commit contractually to minimum volumes  increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to the customer s contracts  although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may be difficult to obtain 
in the galvanizing services segment  the company utilizes contracts with its zinc suppliers that include protective caps to guard against rising commodity prices 
the company also secures firm pricing for natural gas supplies with individual utilities when possible 
there is no contracted volume purchase commitments associated with the zinc or natural gas agreements 
management believes these contractual agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings 
there are no contracted purchase commitments for any other commodity items including steel  aluminum  natural gas  copper  zinc or any other commodity 
other at february   the company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million 
these letters of credit are issued to a portion of the company s customers to cover any potential warranty costs that the customer might incur and in lieu of performance and bid bonds 
in addition  as of february   a warranty reserve in the amount of million has been established to offset any future warranty claims 
the following summarizes the company s operating leases  and long term debt and interest expense for the next five years 
operating leases long term debt interest on long term debt in thousands thereafter total 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported value of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for our conclusions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as business and economic conditions change 
accounting policies and estimates considered most critical are allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals for contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  and impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
more information regarding significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the carrying value of our accounts receivable is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection 
an allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments 
the allowance is determined by historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect of their inability to make payments and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accruals for contingent liabilities the amounts we record for estimated claims  such as self insurance programs  warranty  environmental  and other contingent liabilities  requires us to make judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results may be different than what we estimate 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for the electrical and industrial products segment upon transfer of title and risk to customers  or based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting for electrical products built to customer specifications under long term contracts 
we recognize revenue for the galvanizing services segment upon completion of the galvanizing process performed on the customers material or shipment of this material 
customer advanced payments presented in the balance sheet arises from advanced payments received from our customers prior to shipment of the product and are not related to revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the extent of progress for revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is measured by the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion 
contract costs include direct labor and material  and certain indirect costs 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are able to be determined 
the assumptions made in determining the estimated cost could differ from actual performance resulting in a different outcome for profits or losses than anticipated 
impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
in those situations  impairment losses on long lived assets are measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the asset s fair value  generally determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
a significant change in events  circumstances or projected cash flows could result in an impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets 
an annual impairment test of goodwill is performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
the test is calculated using the anticipated future cash flows from our operating segments 
based on the present value of the future 
table of contents cash flow  we will determine whether impairment may exist 
a significant change in projected cash flows or cost of capital for future years could result in an impairment of goodwill in future years 
variables impacting future cash flows include  but are not limited to  the level of customer demand for and response to products and services we offer to the power generation market  the electrical transmission and distribution markets  the general industrial market and the hot dip galvanizing market  changes in economic conditions of these various markets  raw material and natural gas costs  and availability of experienced labor and management to implement our growth strategies

r  share based payments fas r which will revise fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r will be effective for the company s first quarter of fiscal fas r will require that compensation cost be recognized in the financial statements not only for new awards  but for previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the adoption date 
the company is still evaluating the provisions of fas r  however  it believes the effects should be relatively consistent with the pro forma net income and earnings per share data that is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for the company in fiscal in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaced apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and requires retrospective application a term defined by the statement to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that do not include specific transition provisions 
in addition  sfas no 
redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of errors 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions of this statement will be effective for the company in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk affecting our operations results primarily from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we manage our exposures to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable and fixed rate debt 
we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings at february  after hedges 
on our variable interest rate borrowings  a one percent upward or downward change in interest rates would equate to an approximate  increase or decrease to interest expense 
in march  we entered into an interest rate protection agreement the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge of our variable interest expense related to the term note 
under the swap agreement  we exchanged interest rate obligations from march  through march  by paying a fixed rate of for variable day libor plus at february  
the notional amount of this swap matures in stages 
as of february   the remaining 
table of contents notional amount was million and matures on march  to date  there has been no ineffectiveness related to the swap agreement 
at february   the fair value of the swap agreement was an asset of  a gain of  net of tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we manage our exposures to commodity prices  primarily zinc used in its galvanizing services segment  by utilizing agreements with zinc suppliers that include protective caps to guard against rising commodity prices 
we believe these agreements ensure adequate supplies and partially offset exposure to commodity price swings 
in the electrical and industrial segment  we have exposure to commodity pricing for copper  aluminum  and steel 
increases in price for these items are normally managed through escalation clauses to our customer s contracts  although during difficult market conditions these escalation clauses may not be readily obtainable 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change of of the interest rate currently in effect or a change of of commodity prices would have a significantly adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows as long as we are able to pass along the increases in commodity prices to our customers 
to date  we have been successful in passing along the rising cost of zinc without an adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that either interest rates or commodity prices will not change in excess of the hypothetical amount  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows if we are unable to pass along these increase to our customers
