item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview incyte corporation is focused on the discovery and development of novel drugs to treat major medical conditions 
our three core therapeutic areas are human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv  imflammation and cancer 
we have assembled a team of scientists with core competencies in the areas of medicinal chemistry  and molecular  cellular and in vivo biology 
our most advanced product candidate  dexelvucitabine or dfc formerly known as reversettm  is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor  or nrti  that is being developed as a once a day oral therapy for use in combination with other antiviral drugs for patients with hiv infections 
in  we completed a phase iib trial  study  in treatment experienced hiv patients which demonstrated that dfc provided potent antiviral effects as compared to placebo and was most effective in patients who were not receiving tc  ftc or ddi  currently approved nrtis 
in a meeting with the food drug administration fda to discuss moving dfc directly into two phase iii trials  the fda requested that we conduct a second phase iib clinical trial prior to initiating phase iii 
this second phase iib clinical trial was initiated in february in addition to our dfc development program  we have several internal drug development programs underway 
the most advanced of these programs is focused on developing antagonists to a key chemokine receptor involved in inflammation called ccr we believe that ccr receptor antagonists may represent a new class of compounds to treat various inflammation driven diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  diabetes  and atherosclerosis 
in november  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer inc pfizer which became effective in january pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to incyte s portfolio of ccr antagonist compounds  the most advanced of which is currently in phase iia clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and insulin resistant obese patients 
pfizer s rights extend to the full scope of potential indications  with the exception of multiple sclerosis and one other undisclosed indication  where incyte retained worldwide rights  along with certain compounds 
incyte does not have obligations to pfizer on pre clinical development candidates it selects for pursuit in these indications 
our next most advanced program involves novel sheddase inhibitors that we believe may have application in the treatment of breast cancer and other tumor types 
based on results from single and multiple dose rising phase i clinical trials of our sheddase inhibitor lead candidate in healthy volunteers  we have initiated a phase ib iia dose ranging clinical trial in cancer patients 
we have also selected an oral once a day ccr antagonist compound for hiv that is expected to begin phase i clinical testing in healthy volunteers in the first half of our ccr compound in preclinical testing has shown potent anti hiv activity in cell culture as well as excellent pharmacokinetic properties 
we expect to complete phase i trials in healthy volunteers in the second half of we have recently identified a novel proprietary compound with the potential to treat type diabetes 
the compound is a selective orally available small molecule inhibitor of hsd and is expected to begin phase i clinical trials in the first half of earlier stage programs have generated other compounds with potential for applications in cancer and inflammation 
we anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs 
we also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
we do not expect to generate revenues from our drug discovery and development efforts for several years  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 
transition to drug discovery and development we were founded and incorporated in delaware in until  we devoted substantially all of our resources to the development  marketing and sales of genomic technologies and products to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and research and academic institutions 
we also licensed access to our gene and genomics related intellectual property to our customers 
however  in recent years  consolidation within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and a challenging economic environment led to reduced demand for research tools and services 
this trend  together with the public availability of genomic information  significantly reduced the market for  and revenues from  our information products 
restructuring programs in february  we made the decision to discontinue further development of the information products  close our palo alto headquarters and focus solely on the discovery and development of novel drugs 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in  including charges related to the closure of our facilities  prior tenant improvements and equipment  a workforce reduction and other items 
the restructuring charge originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities 
the lease obligation for the second facility extends through march as a result of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation  we will be recording a charge each period through the march termination date of the lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which total approximately million at december  the cash impact in from restructuring related charges was million 
in december  based on declining estimated future cash flows associated with our gene and genomics related intellectual property  we recorded a charge of million to adjust the carrying value of previously capitalized costs associated with the preparation  prosecution and maintenance of our gene patent portfolio to its estimated fair market value 
in january we sold certain assets and liabilities related to our proteome facility in beverly  massachusetts 
our consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations of our proteome facility as a discontinued operation 
in  we recorded expense of million in connection with a restructuring of our genomic information product line involving the discontinuance of our clone activities and support functions 
this restructuring program included the elimination of employees at our palo alto location and the write down of certain assets related to our genomic information product line 
acquisition of maxia in february  we completed the acquisition of maxia pharmaceuticals  inc maxia  a privately held drug discovery and development company that specialized in small molecule drugs targeting diabetes and other metabolic disorders  cancer  inflammatory diseases and heart disease 
we acquired maxia to create a more advanced and robust pipeline of discovery projects and product candidates and to further our drug discovery and development efforts 
the total purchase price was approximately million  consisting of incyte common stock and cash 
the purchase price was allocated to assets and liabilities acquired and in process research and development expense based on management s estimates of the relative fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities 
the purchase price was allocated as follows in millions current assets current liabilities net tangible liabilities assumed in process research and development total purchase price tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed consist of cash of million  prepaid expenses of million  accounts payable of million and accrued liabilities of million 
these amounts were allocated based on their fair value which approximated their respective carrying value 
as noted above  approximately million of the purchase price represented the estimated fair value of purchased of in process research and development projects that at the time of acquisition had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately charged to operating expense upon the acquisition date and was reflected in the statements of operations as a separate component of operating expense 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was comprised of three compounds which were in stages ranging from discovery to preclinical phases as follows type ii diabetes valued at million  cancer valued at million  and metabolic and other disorders valued at million 
the estimated fair values of these projects were determined by employment of a discounted cash flow model  using discount rates ranging from to 
the discount rates used took into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in process research and development projects that were valued 
at the time of acquisition  the maxia drug development platform was based on three components chemistry  biology and an integrated drug discovery development approach 
features of the chemistry component were novel  small  proprietary molecules 
the biology component was based on leading scientific expertise in the nuclear receptor and signal transduction areas 
the drug discovery platform was believed to provide an accelerated approach to novel drug discovery and development 
management has determined that each of these projects would require significant further development  including the receipt of marketing approval by the fda or equivalent foreign agency  before they would be commercially available 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology acquired and to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
the timing and estimated costs to complete these projects are difficult to predict due to their early stage of development 
at the date of acquisition  significant further development of the maxia compounds remained to be completed 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 we recorded a million charge in related to restructuring costs for maxia  which consisted of workforce reductions and consolidation of facilities 
we recorded employee termination costs of approximately million for employee positions 
the job eliminations were completed in july we also recorded restructuring costs related to lease payments for property that has been vacated and other costs of million 
in   and we also recorded additional charges of million  million and million  respectively  relating to facilities lease expenses in excess of amounts originally estimated 
collaborations and licensing agreements pharmasset collaborative licensing agreement in september  we entered into a collaborative licensing agreement with pharmasset  inc pharmasset to develop and commercialize dfc 
under our agreement with pharmasset  we paid pharmasset an upfront payment of million  which we recorded as a charge to purchased in process research and development expense that is presented as a separate component of operating expenses 
in addition to this one time payment  we also agreed to pay pharmasset certain future performance milestone payments and future royalties on net sales  in exchange for exclusive rights in the united states  europe and certain other markets to develop  manufacture and market the drug 
one of these milestones was met in the second quarter of  resulting in million of research and development expense 
an additional performance milestone was achieved in july  resulting in million of research and development expense 
pharmasset will retain marketing and commercialization rights in certain territories  including south america  mexico  africa  the middle east and china 
pfizer collaborative research and license agreement in november  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer under which pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to incyte s portfolio of ccr antagonist compounds 
incyte received an upfront non refundable payment of million in january and is eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments of up to million for the successful development and commercialization of ccr antagonists in multiple indications  as well as royalties on worldwide sales 
pfizer purchased a million convertible subordinated note in february and may purchase an additional million note at incyte s option after incyte files an investigational new drug application in a retained incyte indication 
the notes will bear no interest  are due seven years from the date of issuance and will be convertible into incyte common stock 
under the agreement  pfizer will also provide research funding to incyte to support the continued expansion of the ccr compound portfolio 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  research and development costs  valuation of long lived assets  accounting for long term investments  and restructuring charges 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual property 
revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist 
we exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the customer s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer 
revenues from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period 
revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
revenues from custom products  such as clones and datasets  were recognized upon completion and delivery 
certain of our contractual arrangements with customers involve multiple deliverables or elements 
under these arrangements  the multiple elements generally consist only of access to our information databases  use of our intellectual property  and sales of our custom products and services 
revenues recognized from multiple element contracts are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
when contracts include non monetary payments  the value of the non monetary transaction is determined using the fair value of the products and services involved  as applicable 
for non monetary payments involving the receipt of equity in a public entity  the fair value is based on the traded stock price on the date revenue is earned 
for non monetary payments involving the receipt of equity in a privately held company  fair value is determined either based on a current or recent arm s length financing by the issuer or upon an independent valuation of the issuer 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
eitf became effective for revenue arrangements we entered into after june  research and development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for research and development costs  it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred 
we often contract with clinical research organizations cros to facilitate  coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug 
to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred  we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract 
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones 
in the event that we prepay cro fees for future milestones  we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed 
most professional fees  including project and clinical management  data management  monitoring  and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period 
these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date 
our cro contracts generally include pass through fees 
pass through fees include  but are not limited to  regulatory expenses  investigator fees  travel costs  and other miscellaneous costs including shipping and printing fees 
because these fees are incurred at various times during the contract term and they are used throughout the contract term  we record a monthly expense allocation to recognize the fees during the contract period 
fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which includes property and equipment as well as intangible and other assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could indicate the need for an impairment review include the following significant changes in the strategy of our overall business  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  we measure the impairment based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value 
accounting for long term investments 
our long term investments have historically consisted of investments in both privately and publicly held companies in which we have owned less than of the outstanding voting stock and have not had the ability to exert significant influence over the investees 
accordingly  our long term investments in privately held companies have been accounted for under the cost method and our investments in publicly held companies have been accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
our investments in publicly held companies are classified as available for sale and are adjusted to their fair value each period based on their quoted market price with any adjustments being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity deficit 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our ownership interests in privately held cost method investees by reviewing conditions that might indicate an other than temporary decline in fair value  including the following financial performance of the investee  achievement of business plan objectives and milestones including the hiring of key employees  obtaining key business partnerships  and progress related to research and development activities  available cash  and completion of debt and equity financings 
if our review of these factors indicates that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the investee has occurred  we estimate the fair value of the investee 
when the carrying value of our investments is materially greater than our pro rata share of the estimated fair value of the investee  we record an impairment charge to reduce our carrying value 
impairment charges are recorded in the period when the related triggering condition becomes known to management 
we use the best information available in performing our periodic evaluations  however  the information available may be limited 
these evaluations involve significant management judgment  and the actual amounts realized for a specific investment may differ from the carrying value 
for our available for sale investments in publicly held investees  we monitor all unrealized losses to determine whether a decline in fair value below carrying value is other than temporary 
generally  when fair value is materially less than carrying value for six consecutive months  we consider the decline to be other than temporary 
when we conclude that a decline is other than temporary  we adjust the carrying value of our long term investments in publicly held investees so that our carrying value per share is equal to the quoted market price per share 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional impairment charges 
restructuring charges 
costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after december   are accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to december  have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab 
restructuring costs resulting from the maxia acquisition have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf 
the restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities  reduce our workforce  write off fixed assets  and pay for outside services incurred in the restructuring 
the workforce reduction charge is determined based on the estimated severance and fringe benefit charge for identified employees 
in calculating the cost to exit the facilities  we estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  the amount  if any  of sublease receipts and real estate broker fees 
this requires us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we perform an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
we also estimate our credit adjusted risk free interest rate in order to discount our projected lease payments in accordance with sfas estimates are also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held for sale 
these estimates are formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  the offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
our estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans 
we periodically evaluate current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary 
we also make adjustments related to professional fees due to actual amounts being lower than originally estimated 
during  such adjustments were made for the restructuring program  restructuring program  and maxia acquisition 
results of operations we recorded net losses from continuing operations for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss from continuing operations was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues our revenues of million  million  and million in   and  respectively were derived primarily from information products  which included database subscriptions  licensing of our intellectual property  and partner programs 
the decrease in revenues from through was due primarily to the closure of our palo alto  california facility and the decision to discontinue offering information products 
we expect that revenues generated from information products  including gene and gene technology related intellectual property  will continue to decline as we focus on our drug discovery and development programs 
for the years ended december    and  revenues from companies considered to be related parties  as defined by fasb statement no 
 related party disclosures sfas were million  million  and million 
our related parties consist of companies in which members of our board of directors have invested  either directly or indirectly  or in which a member of our board of directors is an officer or holds a seat on the board of directors other than an incyte held board seat 
revenues received from agreements with customers in which we have an equity interest were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
revenues recognized from transactions in which there was originally a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or services from the other party to the transaction for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
no new transactions in which we had a concurrent commitment to purchase goods or services from the other party to the transaction were entered into during the year ended december  of commitments made in prior periods  we expensed million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the above transactions were recorded at fair value in accordance with our revenue and expense recognition policies 
operating expenses research and development expenses in millions salary and benefits related collaboration and outside services occupancy and all other costs total research and development expenses we currently track research and development costs by natural expense line and not costs by project 
these costs are exclusive of all charges related to the purchase of in process research and development projects 
the decrease in salary and benefits related costs from through is due primarily to a reduction in headcount 
the number of employees engaged in research and development activities has declined due to the closure of our palo alto facility in and the cessation of the development of the information products developed at this facility 
we expect that there will be no further research and development related to our information business 
the increase in collaboration and outside services from through is due primarily to our increased efforts in our drug discovery and development  the expansion of clinical trials for our compounds and additional preclinical expenditures for potential pharmaceutical candidates partially offset by reduced expenditures related to our information business 
the decrease in occupancy and other costs from through is due primarily to the reduction in our facility costs resulting from the closure of our palo alto facility in research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of preclinical and clinical trial related activities 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  the availability of supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses in millions salary and benefits related other contract services and outside costs total selling  general and administrative expenses the decrease in salary and benefit related costs from through are due primarily to a reduction in headcount due to the closure of our palo alto facility 
the increase in other contract services and outside costs from to is due primarily to costs associated with the transition of our corporate offices from palo alto  california to wilmington  delaware 
the decline in other contract and outside costs from to is due primarily to the closure of palo alto and the elimination of expenses through our restructuring programs 
purchased in process research and development 
purchased in process research and development expenses for the year ended december  of million consisted of million for the acquisition of maxia and million related to a collaborative license agreement with pharmasset 
other expenses 
other expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and represent charges recorded in connection with restructuring and long lived asset impairments 
in  we recorded million of expense in connection with our restructuring program and million of expense in connection with our restructuring program and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of maxia 
in  in conjunction with our restructuring program  we recorded million in expense  including charges related to the closure of our palo alto facility  previously capitalized tenant improvements and equipment  a workforce reduction and other items 
in december  based on declining estimated future cash flows associated with our gene and genomics related intellectual property  we recorded a charge of million to adjust the carrying value of previously capitalized costs associated with the preparation  prosecution and maintenance of our gene patent portfolio to its estimated fair market value 
during we also recorded charges of million related primarily to a reduction in estimated sublease income for a facility closed in connection with our restructuring program and a facility closed in connection with our acquisition of maxia 
in  we restructured our information product line in connection with the discontinuance of our clone activities and support functions and recorded expense of million related to the elimination of certain employees and the write down of certain assets 
in  we also recorded expense of million related primarily to our restructuring program 
other income expense interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  for the years ended december    and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher interest rates in  a million gain from the sale of securities of a strategic investee and a million decline in long term investment impairment charges from to  partially offset by a lower average cash balance 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher interest income associated with cash invested in connection with the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of and million of net proceeds from a public offering of common stock in november and a million decrease in long term investment impairment charges 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in from is related to lower interest expense associated with our repurchase of million face value of our convertible subordinated notes due the increase in from is related to additional interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with our repurchase of million face value of our convertible subordinated notes due gain loss on certain derivative financial instruments 
gain loss on certain derivative financial instruments for the years ended december    and of million  million  and million  respectively  represents the change in fair value of certain long term investments  specifically warrants held in other companies  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities sfas 
gain or loss on derivative financial instruments may fluctuate in any given period based upon current market conditions and is recognized during the period of change 
gain loss on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes 
in   and  we repurchased million  million  and million face value of our convertible subordinated notes due on the open market  respectively 
the repurchase resulted in a gain of million for the year ended december   a loss of million for the year ended december   and a gain of million for the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes

gain loss from discontinued operation 
the gain from discontinued operation of million in and losses from discontinued operation of million and million in  and  respectively  represent the results of our proteome facility based in beverly  massachusetts 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to our proteome facility  which transaction subsequently closed in january the consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations of our proteome facility as a discontinued operation for all periods presented

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued staff position fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
fsp address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in fsp amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
fsp replaces the impairment evaluation guidance of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  with references to existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
eitf s disclosure requirements remain in effect  and are applicable for year end reporting and for interim periods if there are significant changes from the previous year end 
fsp also supersedes eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value  and clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not been made 
fsp applies to reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect fsp will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the compensation cost relating to stock based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued on the grant date of such instruments  and will be recognized over the period during which an individual is required to provide service in exchange for the award typically the vesting period 
sfas r covers a wide range of stock based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion in april  the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of sfas r to the first interim or annual reporting period of a company s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we adopted sfas r on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the fair value as measured under sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b to the start of the fiscal year in which sfas r is adopted 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  prior to january   we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options which had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of granting the option 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will result in million to million of research and development expense and million to million of selling  general and administrative expense in the impact of expensing share based payments  including employee stock options  will be dependent upon the level of share based payments issued  as well as the market price and other judgmental assumptions used in estimating the fair value of such instruments 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
it is unlikely that we will have near term benefits from tax deductions 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because of various factors  including the timing of employee exercises and whether we will be in a taxable position 
at this time  there would be no tax impact related to the prior periods since we are in a net loss position 
in october  the fasb issued a staff position fsp sfas no 
r  practical accommodation of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r fsp sfas no 
r 
fsp sfas no 
r is in response to recent inquiries from constituents to provide guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas r 
one of the criteria in defining the grant date in sfas r is a mutual understanding by the employer and the employee of the key terms and conditions of a share based payment award 
practice has developed such that the grant date of an award is generally the date the award is approved in accordance with an entity s corporate governance provisions  so long as the approved grant is communicated to employees within a relatively short period of time from the date of approval 
for many companies  the number and geographic dispersion of employees receiving share based awards limit the ability to communicate with each employee immediately after the awards have been approved by the board of directors 
as a practical accommodation  a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award to an individual employee shall be presumed to exist at the date the award is approved if the award is a unilateral grant and the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
fsp sfas no 
r was effective for us on january  we do not expect the adoption of fsp sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million as of december  we have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  the issuance of convertible subordinated notes and cash received from our customers 
we have classified all of our marketable securities as short term  as we may choose not to hold our marketable securities until maturity 
available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was due primarily to a decrease of million used to fund restructuring expenses and million decrease used to fund interest expense 
these items were partially offset by a million reduction in cash received from customer sales and an increase of million used to fund research and development and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the million decrease in net cash used in as compared to was primarily due to a million decline in cash used to fund operating expenses and a million decline in cash used to purchase in process research and development 
these items were partially offset by a million reduction in cash received from customers sales  a million increase in cash used for restructuring and increased interest costs of million 
our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long term investments 
capital expenditures for the years ended december    and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures decreased in from due to reduced operational needs related to our information products activities  partially offset by increased spending in support of drug discovery and development efforts 
in  we expended million related to the acquisition of maxia 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  acquisitions  including possible earn out payments to former maxia stockholders  capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   while net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we paid million in connection with repurchases of million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes due the notes  offset partially by million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan 
during  we issued a total of million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
in  we also repurchased million face value of notes on the open market for million 
in november  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million after deducting the underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans in were million 
we repurchased million face value of our notes on the open market for million in  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions total less than year years years over years contractual obligations principal on convertible subordinated debt interest on convertible subordinated debt non cancelable operating lease obligations related to current operations related to vacated space total contractual obligations the amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations 
we have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space with scheduled payments to us of million less than year  million years  million years  and million over years  these scheduled payments are not reflected in the above table 
the table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events 
the most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations are summarized below 
additional commitments related to maxia and pharmasset are also considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable 
in february  we completed our acquisition of maxia 
under the merger agreement  former maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of million in cash and million in our common stock based upon the then fair value could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones 
the milestones are set to occur as maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
in any event  no more than  shares of our common stock may be issued to former maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement 
none of these milestones has been achieved as of december  under the terms of our collaborative licensing agreement with pharmasset  we agreed to pay pharmasset certain future performance milestone payments and future royalties on net sales  one of these milestones was met in the second quarter of  resulting in million of research and development expense 
an additional performance milestone was achieved in july  resulting in million of research and development expense 
we have entered into and intend to continue to seek to license additional rights relating to compounds or technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs 
under these licenses  we may be required to pay up front fees  milestone payments  and royalties on sales of future products 
we expect to use net cash in as we invest in our drug discovery and development programs  make payments related to our restructuring programs  and continue to seek access to technologies through investments  research and development and new alliances  license agreements and or acquisitions 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our expenditures in connection with alliances  license agreements and acquisitions of and investments in complementary products  technologies and businesses  expenditures in connection with potential repayments of notes and notes  expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs  expenditures in connection with litigation  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our receipt of any milestone payments under our collaborative agreement with pfizer  and costs associated with the integration of new operations assumed through mergers and acquisitions 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we expect that future revenues generated from information products  including licensing of intellectual property  will continue to decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs  and in  will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed under contractual obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable securities  which are composed primarily of investment grade corporate bonds  us government agency debt securities and mortgage and asset backed securities  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
our marketable securities also include our investment in the common stock of genomic health  inc at december   the fair market value of our investment in genomic health  inc was million 
this value could decrease based on the volatility of the equity markets and uncertainty of the biotechnology industry  as well as due to specific factors relating to that company s operating results and business 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in fair value would not be material
