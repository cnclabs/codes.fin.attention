overview business  principal products  locations we offer several on demand web collaboration services 
on demand is a software industry term meaning that the software is hosted at the vendor s facilities and furnished to customers as a service sometimes also called software as a service saas or a hosted service rather than the software being furnished in tangible disc or downloaded file form for physical installation on a computer server at the customer s location 
by web collaboration services  we mean services that allow end users to conduct online meetings  share software applications  documents  presentations and other content online  participate in large scale events or programs over the internet using a standard web browser  and coordinate projects  activities and tasks 
our web collaboration services enable users to engage in rich media  interactive  real time communications without the need to be in the same physical location  which we believe allows users to be more productive and efficient 
originally  our principal product offering consisted of a basic real time collaboration service the web meeting 
since then we have expanded our offerings to include more advanced web collaboration services that complement our basic web meeting service 
we sometimes also refer to such enhanced web collaboration services  which are designed for specific uses such as training  events  support and sales  as web applications 
we have recently added to our service offerings a set of asynchronous collaboration services acquired in connection with our intranets 
com  inc intranets acquisition 
the term asynchronous collaboration means collaboration not occurring at the same time and includes capabilities such as shared document folders  shared calendars  task management  shared database applications  discussion forums and contact directories 
our current business focus is to continue to enhance and market our various web collaboration services including web meetings and web applications  to develop and deploy new services such as our new asynchronous collaboration services  to expand our sales and marketing organizations  and to expand our webex mediatone network 
our web collaboration services run on our underlying webex mediatone network 
the webex mediatone network is a private  switched  web based network that is designed to deliver scalable  secure and managed real time web collaboration services 
the webex mediatone network is based on mediatone  our proprietary information switching technology 
our mediatone technology allows the webex mediatone network to handle high speed data  voice and video communications  manage complex media types  and deliver advanced communications capabilities to hundreds or even thousands of computers simultaneously regardless of location across a wide variety of platforms  computer operating systems  devices and browsers in both wired and wireless configurations 
our corporate headquarters is located in santa clara  california  and we have a network operations center located in mountain view  california 
we also lease facilities in various us cities and in several us countries for sales related 
toc activities and  in some cases  to house equipment used in the operation of our mediatone network 
in the case of our china subsidiary  our largest subsidiary  our employees perform activities including quality assurance testing and software development activities  creation of technical documentation  background research for our sales personnel  preparation of marketing materials and the provisioning of customer web sites 
revenue and cash generation models we sell our services directly to customers  which in the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million  and for the full year accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million 
we also sell our services indirectly through our resellers that buy and resell our services 
these sales in the fourth quarter of represented approximately of our revenue  or million  and which for the full year accounted for approximately of our revenue  or million 
with our resellers  we sell our services to and contract directly with the reseller  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the reseller 
we also have another type of distribution arrangement known as a referral arrangement in which a third party refers a potential customer to our direct sales force  which in turn seeks to enter into a contract directly with the potential customer 
when a sale is made from us to a customer through a lead provided by a referral agent  the referral agent receives from us a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of webex services to the customer  and we categorize such revenue as revenue received from services sold directly to customers 
the majority of our revenue is currently generated based on a committed subscription pricing model 
a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent user ports per month  which enables the customer to have that set number of users connected to webex meetings at any one time  or to a minimum minutes commitment  which in the typical case enables the customer to have up to a set number of total minutes to utilize our services during a specified time period 
for minutes based subscriptions  we have expanded our customer offerings from the monthly minutes based commitment offering to include quarterly  semi annual and annual minutes based commitment offerings 
with any of these committed subscription offerings  the customer sometimes also pays overage fees  in addition to the committed subscription price 
overage fees are charged when i a customer subscribing to a set number of ports uses more than the subscribed number of ports in one or more web conference sessions  or ii when a customer on a minutes based subscription pricing model uses more than its commitment 
we also offer flat rate priced services  meaning that the customer pays a set price per month that is not influenced by usage or subject to overage fees 
one of our flat rate offerings is the named host offering  in which a certain named individual may host meetings at which up to a certain number of attendees may participate 
the named host service differs from the concurrent user port offering in several respects i with the concurrent user offering  any employee of the customer may host a meeting  whereas with the named host service only employees who are designated as named hosts may host a meeting  ii the price charged for a named host subscription is appreciably lower than the price charged for a concurrent user subscription  in part because the named host model is less flexible with respect to who can host a meeting  and iii unlike the concurrent user offering  with the named host offering there are effectively no overage fees 
our flat rate offering is another of our committed subscription offerings 
we have recently introduced two new flat rate offerings  targeted at individuals and small businesses 
the first offering  available for purchase online and called meetmenow  is a monthly subscription to a web conferencing service 
the second flat rate offering is our new webex weboffice line of collaboration services  which we offer for purchase through a variety of monthly subscription plans 
we refer to the revenue associated with our various flat rate subscription arrangements  together with the revenue from our ports subscription and minimum minutes subscription arrangements  as committed revenue 
in addition to our committed subscription offerings  there are several situations in which customers are charged per minute or usage based pricing 
these include certain reseller arrangements  customer overage fees for above the contract limit use of ports or minutes  most types of telephony charges  and individual pay per use services purchased directly from our website  and a limited number of customers who do not have a minimum commitment obligation of any kind 
a majority of revenue received from our telecommunications partner arrangements is usage based 
as previously discussed  overage fees are charged when a customer subscribing to a set number of ports uses more than the subscribed number of ports  or when a customer on a minutes pricing model uses more than its commitment 
we get per minute telephony revenue when we provide the audio conferencing component of a web conferencing session 
finally  we have per minute web conferencing services available through our website and payable by credit card 
we refer to the revenue derived from this per minute or usage based pricing model  measured as of the end of any month  as uncommitted revenue 
we typically bill our customers monthly and on open account 
for each of our concurrent user  named host and monthly minutes based commitment subscription customers  the customer is billed monthly in advance based on the monthly subscription amount stated in the customer agreement 
for these customers  additional usage beyond the monthly subscription quantity  or overage  is billed in arrears based on the actual amount of such overage 
for quarterly  semi annual and annual minutes based subscription customers  all monthly billing is in arrears and based on actual usage during the month 
if  following the last month 
toc billed  aggregate actual usage is less than the subscription amount  then in addition to actual usage for the final month  the customer is billed for the remaining amount of the contractual commitment not previously billed 
market opportunities  related challenges and our responses we believe the market for on demand web collaboration services to be healthy and growing 
various published articles have cited several trends underlying this projected market increase 
one trend is the desire of many companies to achieve cost savings in the areas of information technology  or it  spending and employee travel 
in light of increased it budget constraints reportedly faced by many companies and particularly small companies or self employed individuals  we believe a cost saving decision is to hire an on demand web collaboration services vendor to meet a company s needs  rather than undertaking the capital and personnel spending necessary to construct and maintain an internal company or home office network 
additionally  as a result of increasing fuel prices and travel costs  we believe companies may decide that online collaboration that is  web conferencing and web applications usage can reduce costs and obviate the need to travel to conduct business  perform training  provide support or participate in large attendee events 
however  it is possible that growth in the market for web collaboration services may slow down or be less than currently projected 
there exist a number of challenges to the projected market growth scenario for on demand web collaboration services  including a concern actual or perceived about security 
as the universe of corporate activities that can be conducted in a web conference or with a web application expands  more and more of these activities will embrace sensitive corporate or government financial data  plans  projects or other proprietary information 
if on demand web collaboration technologies do not have embedded within them adequate security protections so that the contents of  for example  web conference or application will remain private among the participants  usage may not grow as projected 
moreover  to the extent that there occur publicized incidents of security breaches associated with usage of a web collaboration technology  regardless of which vendor is involved  the security related concerns of would be users of the technology likely will be increased and this could dampen market growth 
we have assigned a high priority  in the design and implementation of our webex mediatone network  to these security issues 
another challenge to broad adoption of on demand web collaboration services is general acceptance of this mode of communication as a normal part of business activity 
individuals may not feel comfortable using the technology  or they may prefer traditional means of communicating such as the telephone or face to face meetings 
broad adoption of web collaboration will occur only if large numbers of users incorporate the use of this technology as part of their normal business activity 
industry wide factors relevant to us the collaboration software and services market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our on demand web collaboration services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies including online application services providers  and web conferencing products and services such as adobe systems  cisco systems  citrix systems  genesys  ibm  microsoft  netviewer  ntr  oracle  pc visit  saba  and salesforce 
com 
in addition to the above competitors  certain of our resellers offer competitive web conferencing  web application and other collaborative web communications services 
one of our key resellers  intercall  is a subsidiary of west corporation which recently announced its intention to acquire our competitor raindance 
as a result of its acquisition of raindance  intercall could choose to increase its emphasis on offerings competitive with ours  or cease to offer some or all of our offerings  or both 
competition from microsoft for the collaboration software and services markets may adversely affect us 
microsoft has a product offering which is competitive with ours and which is called microsoft office live meeting 
in mid  microsoft announced the acquisition of collaboration software provider groove networks 
in november  microsoft previewed by press announcement its microsoft office live offering  which it described as a set of internet based software services 
microsoft is currently offering a free beta  or pre commercial release  version of office live 
microsoft s investment of development and marketing resources in products or services that compete directly with us and microsoft s integration of competitive technologies from other companies  including groove networks and placeware  may have an adverse impact on our business 
more generally  microsoft may attempt to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser markets  through technical integration or bundled offerings  to expand further its presence in these web communications markets 
this expanded microsoft presence in web collaboration markets could make it difficult for other vendors of web communications products and services  such as webex  to compete 
in addition  some competitors offer web communications products and services targeted at customers who are more price conscious and are less concerned about functionality  scalability  integration and security features 
such offerings may make it more difficult for us to compete in that segment of the market and may cause some of our existing customers to switch to these 
toc competitors 
in  we introduced new services with lower entry prices that enable us to compete more effectively with such offerings 
if our industry were to experience a general decline in prices and there were not a sufficient increase in volume to compensate for the price reductions  we might be forced to change the extent and type of resources we deploy in the selling of our services in an effort to maintain operating margins  such as switching to different sales practices 
finally  some of our competitors offer software products or products that are a combination of software and hardware that include web collaborations functionality  and which allow customers to purchase such products  install them at their own facilities  and manage the products by themselves 
if significant numbers of existing or potential customers determine that they would prefer to have their web conferencing or more advanced web collaboration needs met with these types of products  demand for webex services may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  sales reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and equity based compensation 
the policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of web collaboration services 
web collaboration services revenue is generated through a variety of contractual arrangements directly with customers and with resellers  who in turn sell the services to customers 
we sell web collaboration services directly to customers through service subscriptions and pay per use arrangements 
under these arrangements  customers access the application hosted on our servers using a standard web browser 
subscription arrangements include monthly subscriber user fees and user set up fees 
the subscription arrangements are considered service arrangements in accordance with eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and with multiple deliverables under eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in addition  because we provide our applications as a service  we follow the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under eitf  all deliverables are considered one unit of accounting  therefore  committed revenue is recognized ratably straight line over the current term of the contract and variable usage based fees are recognized as usage occurs 
during the initial term  we provide training services  web page design and set up services 
some minute based subscriptions involve a quarterly  semi annual or annual rather than monthly commitment by the customer 
in these cases  all monthly billing is in arrears and monthly revenue is recognized based on actual usage during the month 
if  following the last month billed  aggregate actual usage is less than the subscription amount  then in addition to actual usage for the final month the customer is billed and revenue is recognized for the remaining amount of the contractual commitment not previously billed 
in addition to subscription services revenue  we derive revenue from pay per use services and telephony charges that are recognized as the related services are provided 
we also enter into reselling arrangements with certain resellers  which purchase and resell our services on a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis 
revenue under these arrangements is derived from our services provided to end users and is recognized over the service period provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
initial set up fees received in connection with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract 
during the initial term  we provide training services  web page design and set up services 
service fees are recognized as the services are provided for pay per use service arrangements and ratably over the service period for services provided on a subscription basis through the reseller 
our reseller arrangements may require guaranteed minimum revenue commitments that are billed in advance to the reseller 
advance payments received from resellers are deferred until the 
toc related services are provided or until otherwise earned by us 
we contract directly with resellers  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the reseller 
persuasive evidence for all of our arrangements is represented by signed contracts 
the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility of guaranteed minimum revenue commitments by resellers is not reasonably assured  thus revenue from guaranteed minimum commitments is deferred until services are provided to an end user customer or until collected from the reseller and the reseller forfeits commitment fees at the end of the commitment period 
sales reserves the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to the sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based primarily on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to insolvency of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based primarily on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
if we are uncertain whether a loss is appropriately charged to the sales reserve or the allowance for doubtful accounts  we charge the loss to the sales reserve 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance and the allowance for doubtful accounts account balance based primarily on historical experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the following presents the detail of the changes in the sales reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts for the eight quarters ended december  december  september june march december  september  june march sales reserve dollars in thousands beginning balance amounts deducted from revenue amounts written off ending balance allowance for doubtful accounts beginning balance amounts charged credited to bad debt expense amounts written off ending balance total sales reserve and allowance for doubtful accounts beginning balance amounts deducted from revenue charged credited to bad debt expense amounts written off 
toc ending balance gross accounts receivable sales reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable total receivable reserves as a percentage of gross accounts receivable income taxes we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each year based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are also determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded 
for the year ended december   we evaluated our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance related to the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
the evaluation resulted in the realization of the tax benefit of these deferred assets of  for the balance of the year  of which  was accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we account for income tax contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
amortizable intangible assets subject to this evaluation include acquired developed technology  intellectual property rights  trade names and domain names and customer contracts and relationships 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset  significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions  and current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 

toc our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting unit with goodwill 
if our revenue and cost forecasts are not achieved  we may incur a charge for goodwill impairment  which could have a material adverse effect on our income statement 
equity based compensation we have elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employee  in accounting for employee equity based compensation  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
therefore  we do not record compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees when the exercise price equals the deemed fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
in accordance with sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 we disclose our pro forma net income and net income per share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
in calculating such fair value  we make certain assumptions  as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements  consisting of the expected life of the option  volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield and the weighted average fair value of grants 
actual volatility  expected lives  risk free interest rates and dividend yield may be different than our assumptions which would result in an actual value of the options being different than estimated 
in determining volatility  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we determined that a combination of implied volatility and historical volatility is a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility alone 
in addition  we modified our assumption of the expected life of stock options granted during the fourth quarter of to years based on further analysis 
we believe that these refinements will generate more representative estimates of fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations net revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands net revenues increase  period over period percentage increase  period over period net revenues increased in and as compared to the prior year periods due primarily to growth in our domestic and international subscriber base and increased usage of existing and new service products 
during  organic growth in the number of customers for our core applications increased by to over  customers 
in addition  with the acquisition of intranets during the third quarter of  an additional  new customers were added to our installed customer base 
during  the number of customers in our subscriber base grew by more than as compared to us net revenues were million for  an increase of from the prior year  while international net revenues increased to million during included in us net revenues for was total non recurring revenue of 
toc million and million recognized in the third and fourth quarters  respectively  from a project with the us department of defense dod 
this revenue is in addition to our commercial managed service contract with the dod 
in  we recorded million of revenues related to intranets  including  in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of in  us net revenues were million and international net revenues were million 
one of the measurement tools  or metrics  which we use to help forecast future revenues is what we refer to as monthly revenue rate mrr 
we define mrr as the sum of the following i committed monthly subscriptions  or the aggregate dollar amount of minimum minutes  named hosts and ports that are contractually committed to us  as of the end of the month  and ii average monthly uncommitted revenue for the quarter  or the aggregate dollar amounts of per minute or usage based services such as reseller related  overage  telephony and pay per use revenues for the quarter  divided by three 
our monthly subscription contracts at the end of december were approximately million and our average monthly uncommitted revenue in the quarter ended december  was million 
thus our monthly revenue rate exiting december was million 
while the quarter exiting mrr is used by us as a forecasting tool for the following quarter s revenue  the actual revenue in the next quarter is impacted by other factors in addition to the mrr entering that quarter 
these factors include such items as i new customer bookings and customer cancellations  and the timing of each during the quarter  ii usage based revenues  iii customer credits  iv set up fees  fees charged for one time customer events and other non recurring revenues that are not included in mrr  v partner commitment fees in deferred revenue  and vi sales reserve adjustments 
certain revenue elements not included in mrr have been declining in recent quarters due to changes in our business practices 
for example  due to recent changes in our sales compensation plans  our sales employees  where permitted to give customer discounts  have been more apt than previously to give discounts on the set up fee portion of a customer s payment obligation and less apt than previously to give discounts on the monthly subscription  or mrr  portion of the customer s payment obligation 
also  we now less frequently require a prepaid commitment from a reseller than we previously did 
on the other hand  customer credits  which are among the factors outside of mrr that operate to reduce our revenue  have increased in the most recent three quarters 
also  quarterly minutes based subscriptions have been increasing 
while quarterly or semiannual minutes based subscriptions are included in the subscription portion of mrr  the revenue associated with them is recognized variably based on usage until the end of the quarterly or semiannual billing period 
the following table shows our mrr for the eight quarters ended december  december  september june march december  september  june march in millions uncommitted usage monthly average during the quarter contracted subscriptions at the end of the quarter total mrr our lost customer ratio is based on customer count and is calculated as the quotient obtained from the following i the average monthly number of lost customers including customers who have switched their purchases of our services from us directly to our partners during the quarter  divided by ii our total number of customers at the end of the last month of the quarter plus the average monthly number of lost customers during the quarter including customers who have switched their purchases of our services from us directly to our partners 
our lost subscription customer ratio for the three months ended december  was per month  which includes intranets beginning in the fourth quarter of the following table shows our lost customer ratio for the eight quarters ended december  december  september june march december  september  june march lost subscription customer ratio percentage cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to user set up  network and data center operations  technical support and training activities  including internet access and telephony communication costs  personnel  licensed software and equipment costs and depreciation 
total cost of revenues for the periods reported was as follows 
toc year ended december  dollars in thousands cost of revenues percentage of net revenues increase  period over period percentage increase  period over period cost of revenues increased and during and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year periods due primarily to increases in the costs for delivering existing and new services to more domestic and international customers 
in addition  we increased our technical staff during and during to support our installed base of customers as well as increased expenditures to expand and improve our worldwide network 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized aggregate costs related to the non recurring dod arrangement in the amount of million 
also  during the third quarter of  we acquired intranets  which resulted in the recording of purchased intangible assets  including developed technology  which is amortized into cost of revenues 
during  the amortization related to the developed technology from intranets was approximately  in  we purchased land and a building containing approximately  square feet of commercial grade facility of which  square feet consists of data infrastructure facility floor space for million 
land totaling million is not depreciated  and the building totaling million is being depreciated over years 
as part of the purchase  we also acquired certain items of data infrastructure equipment previously installed and situated on the property 
during  we used this facility as our network operating center as well as to expand our primary switching center to accommodate growing usage requirements on our webex mediatone network 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs  including commissions for sales  marketing and customer care  as well as costs of public relations  advertising  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses for the periods reported were as follows year ended december  dollar in thousands sales and marketing percentage of net revenues increase  period over period percentage increase  period over period sales and marketing expense increased and during and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year periods due primarily to increased spending on sales and support personnel and additional spending on advertising and marketing related programs to build brand awareness and generate leads for our sales force 
sales and marketing headcount increased in and in  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year periods 
during  we launched several new marketing programs around new product releases  including the release of weboffice  which is intended to expand our offerings in the small to medium business market  as well as meetmenow and pcnow  which are targeted to individual professionals 
in february  we experienced a fire at our amsterdam headquarters  which resulted in additional expenses of million in the first quarter of during the third and fourth quarter of  we received  and  respectively  from our insurance carrier in connection with this loss  which amounts were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense in the periods received 
research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  depreciation of equipment and supplies  and consulting engineering services 
research and development expenses for the periods reported were as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands research and development 
toc percentage of net revenues increase  period over period percentage increase  period over period research and development expense increased and during and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year periods due primarily to increases in personnel and equipment related expenses resulting from an increase in headcount to develop and support existing and new products including increases in the number of such personnel in webex china 
research and development headcount increased in and in  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a small  but growing  part of our business is conducted outside the united states 
in the majority of non us transactions  whether they are revenue transactions or the payment of expenses or other obligations owing in the non us country  the currency involved is the local currency 
in some countries we have far more sales collections than we do payment obligations  in other countries  the reverse is true 
for example  in china we have significant payment obligations that must be made in chinese currency including employee salaries and lease payments  and these are currently not offset by revenues in china 
as a result of this imbalance between local currency collections and payments in certain non us countries  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in such foreign markets 
when the amount of revenues obtained from sources outside the united states becomes significant  we may engage in hedging activities or other actions to decrease fluctuations in operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments or market risk sensitive instruments 
instead  we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments and believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
