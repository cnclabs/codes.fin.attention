item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our financial condition and results of our operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our discussion and analysis includes the following executive summary acquisitions and internal growth projects critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting pronouncements and change in accounting principle results of operations outlook liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements executive summary company overview we are engaged in interstate and intrastate crude oil transportation  and crude oil gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage  as well as the marketing and storage of liquefied petroleum gas and other natural gas related petroleum products 
we have an extensive network of pipeline transportation  terminalling  storage and gathering assets in key oil producing basins  transportation corridors and at major market hubs in the united states and canada 
in addition  through our equity ownership in paa vulcan  we are engaged in the development and operation of natural gas storage facilities 
we were formed in september  and our operations are conducted directly and indirectly through our primary operating subsidiaries  plains marketing  lp  plains pipeline  lp and plains marketing canada  lp we are one of the largest midstream crude oil companies in north america 
as of december   we owned approximately  miles of active crude oil pipelines  approximately million barrels of active terminalling and storage capacity and approximately transport trucks 
currently  we handle an average of over million barrels per day of physical crude oil through our extensive network of assets located in major oil producing regions of the united states and canada 
our operations consist of two operating segments i pipeline transportation operations pipeline and ii gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations gmt s 
through our pipeline segment  we engage in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation and certain related margin activities 
through our gmt s segment  we engage in purchases and resales of crude oil and lpg at various points along the distribution chain and we operate certain terminalling and storage assets 
overview of operating results  capital spending and significant activities during  we recognized net income of million and earnings per diluted limited partner unit of  compared to million and  respectively during both and were substantial increases over the results for as compared to the two previous years were significantly impacted by increased segment profit in both of our operating segments 
key items impacting include favorable market conditions characterized by relatively strong contango market conditions and significantly high volatility in price and market structure of crude oil 
increased contributions to both of our operating segments attributable to a full year of operation of businesses acquired in and the realization of synergies from those businesses 
the inclusion in of an aggregate charge of approximately million related to our long term incentive plans

the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
our estimates indicate that the negative effect of these hurricanes was approximately million including approximately million of operating costs  net of estimated insurance reimbursements 
this includes disruptions to our operations and uninsured damage to some of our terminals and other facilities 
on an overall basis  the hurricanes did not have a material impact on our revenue generating capacity 
we continued to develop internal growth projects to optimize and expand our presence in our operating areas  while continuing to pursue strategic and accretive acquisitions 
these activities totaled million in and included the formation of a joint venture paa vulcan that made an acquisition of natural gas storage facilities 
see acquisitions and internal growth projects 
in addition  we maintained the relative strength of our overall capital structure and increased liquidity through a series of equity issuances and senior notes issuances 
we also expanded and extended the size and maturity of our credit facilities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
prospects for the future we believe that our terminalling and storage activities and our gathering and marketing activities are counter cyclical 
we believe that this balance of activities  combined with our pipeline transportation operations  generally provides us with the flexibility to maintain a base level of margin irrespective of whether a strong or weak market exists and  in certain circumstances  to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions 
during  we strengthened our business by expanding our asset base through acquisitions and internal growth projects 
in  we intend to spend approximately million on internal growth projects and also to continue to develop our inventory of projects for implementation beyond we believe the outlook is positive for  and have a strategic initiative of increasing our participation in  the importation of foreign crude oil  primarily through building a meaningful asset presence to enable us to receive foreign crude oil via the gulf coast 
we also believe there are opportunities for us to grow our lpg business 
in addition  our recent entry into the natural gas storage business is consistent with our stated strategy of leveraging our assets  business model  knowledge and expertise into businesses that are complementary to our existing activities 
we will continue to look for ways to grow the natural gas storage business and continue to evaluate opportunities in other complementary midstream business activities 
we believe we have access to equity and debt capital and that we are well situated to optimize our position in and around our existing assets and to expand our asset base by continuing to consolidate  rationalize and optimize the north american midstream infrastructure 
although we believe that we are well situated in the north american midstream infrastructure  we face various operational  regulatory and financial challenges that may impact our ability to execute our strategy as planned 
in addition  we operate in a mature industry and believe that acquisitions will play an important role in our potential growth 
we will continue to pursue the purchase of midstream crude oil assets  and we will also continue to initiate expansion projects designed to optimize crude oil flows in the areas in which we operate 
however  we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition or expansion efforts will be successful

acquisitions and internal growth projects we completed a number of acquisitions and capital expansion projects in  and that have impacted our results of operations and liquidity discussed herein 
the following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the periods indicated in millions acquisition capital investment in paa vulcan gas storage  llc internal growth projects maintenance capital total acquisition capital includes deposits in the year the acquisition closed  rather than the year the deposit was paid 
deposits paid were approximately million for the shell gulf coast pipeline systems acquisition in and approximately million for the capline acquisition in internal growth projects during and we increased our focus on expansion and internal growth opportunities 
we increased our annual level of spending on these projects over in from and increased an additional in over the amount spent in the following table summarizes our and projects in millions projects trenton pipeline expansion st

with the exception of the cushing to broome pipeline and the trenton pipeline expansion  the revenue contribution associated with the projects discussed above were minimal  but we expect revenue contribution to increase in and further increase in we expect to continue our focus on internal growth projects during see liquidity and capital resources capital expansion projects 
acquisitions the following acquisitions were accounted for  and the purchase prices were allocated  in accordance with sfas  business combinations  unless otherwise noted 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our acquisition activities 
the majority of our acquisitions were initially financed with borrowings under our credit facilities  which were subsequently repaid with portions of the proceeds from equity issuances and the issuance of senior notes 
the businesses acquired impacted our results of operations commencing on the effective date of each acquisition as indicated in the tables below 
our ongoing acquisitions and capital expansion activities are discussed further in liquidity and capital resources 
acquisitions we completed six small transactions in for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
the transactions included crude oil trucking operations and several crude oil pipeline systems along the gulf coast as well as in canada 
we also acquired an lpg pipeline and terminal in oklahoma 
these acquisitions did not materially impact our results of operations  either individually or in the aggregate

capline and capwood pipeline systems 
the principal assets acquired are i an approximate undivided joint interest in the capline pipeline system  and ii an approximate undivided joint interest in the capwood pipeline system 
the capline pipeline system is a mile  inch mainline crude oil pipeline originating in st 
james  louisiana  and terminating in patoka  illinois 
the capwood pipeline system is a mile  inch mainline crude oil pipeline originating in patoka  illinois  and terminating in wood river  illinois 
these pipelines provide one of the primary transportation routes for crude oil shipped into the midwestern us and delivered to several refineries and other pipelines 
link energy llc 
the link crude oil business we acquired consisted of approximately  miles of active crude oil pipeline and gathering systems  over million barrels of active crude oil storage capacity  a fleet of approximately owned or leased trucks and approximately million barrels of crude oil linefill and working inventory 
the link assets complement our assets in west texas and along the gulf coast and allow us to expand our presence in the rocky mountain and oklahoma kansas regions 
acquisitions during  we completed ten acquisitions for aggregate consideration of approximately million including an accrual for the deferred purchase price of a acquisition 
the aggregate consideration includes cash paid  estimated transaction costs  assumed liabilities and estimated near term capital costs 
these acquisitions did not materially impact our results of operations  either individually or in the aggregate

these objectives were met as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
these critical accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that we have identified are discussed below 
purchase and sales accruals 
we routinely make accruals based on estimates for certain components of our revenues and cost of sales due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
where applicable  these accruals are based on nominated volumes expected to be purchased  transported and subsequently sold 
uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead  access to certain qualities of crude oil  pipeline capacities and delivery times  utilization of truck fleets to transport volumes to their destinations  weather  market conditions and other forces beyond our control 
these estimates are generally associated with a portion of the last month of each reporting period 
we currently estimate that less than of total annual revenues and cost of sales are recorded using estimates and less than of total quarterly revenues and cost of sales are recorded using estimates 
accordingly  a variance from this estimate of would impact the respective line items by less than on both an annual and quarterly basis 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition  because of the high volume  low margin nature of our business  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
variances from estimates are reflected in the period actual results become known  typically in the month following the estimate 
mark to market accrual 
in situations where we are required to mark to market derivatives pursuant to sfas  the estimates of gains or losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
we reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
a portion of the estimates we use are based on internal models or models of third parties because they are not quoted on a national market 
additionally  values may vary among different models due to a difference in assumptions applied  such as the estimate of prevailing market prices  volatility  correlations and other factors and may not be reflective of the price at which they can be settled due to the lack of a liquid market 
less than of total revenues are based on estimates derived from these models 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
contingent liability accruals 
we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities including  but not limited to  environmental remediation and governmental penalties  insurance claims  asset retirement obligations and potential legal claims 
accruals are made when our assessment indicates that it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on all known facts at the time and our assessment of the ultimate outcome 
among the many uncertainties that impact our estimates are the necessary regulatory approvals for  and potential modification of  our environmental remediation plans  the limited amount of data available upon initial assessment of the impact of soil or water contamination  changes in costs associated with environmental remediation services and equipment  costs of medical care associated with worker s compensation and employee health insurance claims  and the possibility of existing legal claims giving rise to additional claims 
our estimates for contingent liability accruals are increased or decreased as additional information is obtained or resolution is achieved 
a variance of in our aggregate estimate for the contingent liabilities discussed above would have an approximate million impact on earnings 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and identification of associated goodwill and intangible assets 
in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we also estimate the amount of transaction costs that will be incurred in connection with each acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  we may adjust the original estimates within a short time period subsequent to the acquisition 
in addition  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  we are required to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the asset  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life determined by management 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired  as well as intangible assets that relate to such items as customer relationships  contracts  and industry expertise involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on acquisition models and management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired and  to the extent available  third party assessments 
uncertainties associated with these estimates include changes in production decline rates  production interruptions  fluctuations in refinery capacity or product slates  economic obsolescence factors in the area and potential future sources of cash flow 
although the resolution of these uncertainties has not historically had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
long term incentive plan ltip accruals 
we also make accruals for potential payments under our ltip and ltip plans when we determine that vesting of the common units granted under these plans is probable 
the aggregate amount of the actual charge to expense will be determined by the unit price on the date vesting occurs or  in some cases  the average unit price for a range of dates multiplied by the number of units  plus our share of associated employment taxes 
uncertainties involved in this accrual include whether or not we actually achieve the specified performance requirements  the actual unit price at time of settlement and the continued employment of personnel subject to the vestings 
we have concluded that it is probable that we will achieve a annualized distribution rate and therefore have accelerated the recognition of compensation expense related to the portion of the awards that vest up to that rate 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to recognize expense when it is considered probable that phantom unit grants under the ltip plans will vest 
as a result  we recognized total compensation expense of approximately million in and million in related to the awards granted under our ltip and our ltip plans 
a change in our unit price of from the amount we used to record our accrual would have an impact of approximately million on our operating income 
we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts

recent accounting pronouncements and change in accounting principle recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will impact us  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our method of accounting for pipeline linefill in third party assets 
previously  we had viewed pipeline linefill  whether in our assets or third party assets  as having long term characteristics rather than characteristics typically associated with the short term classification of operating inventory 
therefore  previously we did not include linefill barrels in the same average costing calculation as our operating inventory  but instead carried linefill at historical cost 
following this change in accounting principle  the linefill in third party assets that we historically classified as a portion of pipeline linefill on the face of the balance sheet a long term asset and carried at historical cost  is included in inventory a current asset in determining the average cost of operating inventory and applying the lower of cost or market analysis 
at the end of each period  we reclassify the linefill in third party assets not expected to be liquidated within the succeeding twelve months out of inventory a current asset  at average cost  and into inventory in third party assets a long term asset  which is now reflected as a separate line item within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
this change in accounting principle was effective january  and is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as of january   is a charge of approximately million  representing a reduction in inventory of approximately million  a reduction in pipeline linefill of approximately million and an increase in inventory in third party assets of million 
the pro forma impact for the year ended december  is detailed below impact of change reported in accounting principle pro forma year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  in millions  except per unit amounts net income basic income per limited partner unit diluted income per limited partner unit results of operations analysis of operating segments our operations consist of two operating segments i pipeline and ii gmt s 
through our pipeline segment  we engage in interstate and intrastate crude oil pipeline transportation and certain related margin activities 
through our gmt s segment  we engage in purchases and resales of crude oil and lpg at various points along the distribution chain  and we operate certain terminalling and storage assets 
we believe that the combination of our terminalling and storage activities and gathering and marketing activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
in a contango market oil prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we use our tankage to improve our gathering margins by storing crude oil we have purchased at lower prices in the current month for delivery at higher prices in future months 
in a backwardated market oil prices for future deliveries are lower than for current deliveries  we use less storage capacity  but increased marketing margins premiums for prompt delivery resulting from higher demand provide an offset to this reduced cash flow 
in addition  we supplement the counter cyclical balance of our asset base with derivative hedging activities in an effort to maintain a base level of margin irrespective of whether a strong or weak market exists and  in certain circumstances  to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment profit and maintenance capital 
we define segment profit as revenues less i purchases and related costs  ii field operating costs and iii segment general and administrative g a expenses 
each of the items above excludes depreciation and amortization 
as a master limited partnership  we make quarterly distributions of our available cash as defined in our partnership agreement to our unitholders 
therefore  we look at each period s earnings before non cash depreciation and amortization as an important measure of segment performance 
the exclusion of depreciation and amortization expense could be viewed as limiting the usefulness of segment profit as a performance measure because it does not account in current periods for the implied reduction in value of our capital assets  such as crude oil pipelines and facilities  caused by aging and wear and tear 
management compensates for this limitation by recognizing that depreciation and amortization are largely offset by repair and maintenance costs  which mitigate the actual decline in the value of our principal fixed assets 
these maintenance costs are a component of field operating costs included in segment profit or in maintenance capital  depending on the nature of the cost 
maintenance capital  which is deducted in determining available cash  consists of capital expenditures required either to maintain the existing operating capacity of partially or fully depreciated assets or to extend their useful lives 
capital expenditures made to expand our existing capacity  whether through construction or acquisition  are considered expansion capital expenditures  not maintenance capital 
repair and maintenance expenditures associated with existing assets that do not extend the useful life or expand the operating capacity are charged to expense as incurred 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment profit to consolidated income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
pipeline operations as of december   we owned approximately  miles of which approximately  miles are included in our pipeline segment of active gathering and mainline crude oil pipelines located throughout the united states and canada 
our activities from pipeline operations generally consist of transporting volumes of crude oil for a fee and third party leases of pipeline capacity collectively referred to as tariff activities  as well as barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements collectively referred to as pipeline margin activities 
in connection with certain of our merchant activities conducted under our gathering and marketing business  we are also shippers on certain of our own pipelines 
these transactions are conducted at published tariff rates and eliminated in consolidation 
tariffs and other fees on our pipeline systems vary by receipt point and delivery point 
the segment profit generated by our tariff and other fee related activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff and other fees charged as well as the fixed and variable field costs of operating the pipeline 
segment profit from our pipeline capacity leases  barrel exchanges and buy sell arrangements generally reflect a negotiated amount 
the following table sets forth our operating results from our pipeline segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions operating results revenues tariff activities pipeline margin activities total pipeline operations revenues costs and expenses pipeline margin activities purchases field operating costs excluding ltip charge ltip charge operations segment g a expenses excluding ltip charge ltip charge general and administrative segment profit maintenance capital average daily volumes thousands of barrels per day tariff activities all american basin capline n a cushing to broome n a n a north dakota trenton n a west texas new mexico area systems canada other total tariff activities pipeline margin activities total revenues and purchases include intersegment amounts 
pipeline margin activities includes revenues associated with buy sell arrangements of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
volumes associated with these arrangements were approximately   and  barrels per day for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
pipeline margin activities purchases includes purchases associated with buy sell arrangements of million million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
volumes associated with these arrangements were approximately   and  barrels per day for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
segment g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each year 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent total volumes transported for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the period 
the aggregate of multiple systems in the west texas new mexico area 
total revenues for our pipeline segment have increased over the three year period ended december  the revenue increase in relates both to our tariff activities and to our margin activities 
the increase in revenues from tariff activities in the period is primarily related to increased volumes resulting from our acquisition activities as discussed further below 
the increase in revenues from our margin activities in and is related to higher average prices for crude oil sold and transported on our san joaquin valley gathering system in each of the years compared to the prior year 
the increase in was also favorably impacted by an increase in buy sell volumes as compared to the applicable prior year 
because the barrels that we buy and sell are generally indexed to the same pricing indices  revenues and purchases will increase and decrease with changes in market prices without significant changes to our margins related to those purchases and sales 
segment profit  our primary measure of segment performance  was impacted by the following increased volumes and related tariff revenues the increase in volumes and related tariff revenues during primarily relates to the link acquisition and other acquisitions completed during and this increase primarily resulted from the inclusion of the related assets for the entire period versus only a portion of the period 
the increase in volumes and related tariff revenues in versus is primarily related to the link acquisition  the capline acquisition and other acquisitions completed during and late increased revenues from our loss allowance oil as is common in the industry  our crude oil tariffs incorporate a loss allowance factor intended to offset losses due to evaporation  measurement and other losses in transit 
the loss allowance factor averages approximately by volume 
we value the variance of allowance volumes to actual losses at the average market value at the time the variance occurred and the result is recorded as either an increase or decrease to tariff revenues 
gains or losses on sales of allowance oil barrels are also included in tariff revenues 
revenues related to loss allowance oil increased during as compared to and because of increased volumes and higher crude oil prices 
the average nymex crude oil price for was per barrel versus per barrel in and per barrel in increased field operating costs our continued growth  primarily from the link acquisition and other acquisitions completed during  is the principal cause of the million increase in field operating costs to million including the ltip charge in and also the cause for increases in costs in the increased costs primarily relate to i payroll and benefits  ii emergency response and environmental remediation of pipeline releases  iii maintenance and iv utilities 
increased segment g a expenses segment g a expenses excluding ltip charges were relatively flat in compared to however  expense related to our ltip increased million in the period as compared to the period 
the increase in segment g a expenses in is primarily related to the link acquisition coupled with the increase in the percentage of indirect costs allocated to the pipeline operations segment in the period as our pipeline operations have grown 
g a costs also increased in compared to because of increased headcount from our growth and higher costs related to compliance activities attributable to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
these items were partially offset by the inclusion of an ltip charge of approximately million in compared to million in the as discussed above  the increase in pipeline segment profit is largely related to our acquisition activities 
we have completed a number of acquisitions during  and that have impacted our results of operations 
the following table summarizes the impact of recent acquisitions and expansions on volumes and revenues related to our tariff activities year ended december  revenues volumes revenues volumes revenues volumes volumes in thousands of barrels per day and revenues in millions tariff activities acquisitions expansions n a n a n a n a acquisitions expansions n a n a acquisitions expansions all other pipeline systems total tariff activities revenues include intersegment amounts 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent total volumes transported for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the year 
to the extent there has been an expansion to one of our existing pipeline systems  any incremental revenues and volumes are included in the category for the period that the pipeline was acquired 
for new pipeline systems that we construct  incremental revenues and volumes are included in the period the system became operational 
in  average daily volumes from our tariff activities increased by approximately to approximately million barrels per day  and revenues from our tariff activities increased by approximately to approximately million 
the increase is attributable to pipeline systems acquired or brought into service during  which contributed approximately  barrels per day and million of revenues during approximately  barrels per day and million of revenues are attributable to our recently constructed cushing to broome pipeline system 
volumes and revenues from pipeline systems acquired in increased in as compared to  reflecting the following an increase in as compared to of  barrels per day and million of revenues from the pipelines acquired in the link acquisition  reflecting the inclusion of these systems for the entire period as compared to only a portion of the period 
the period also includes i increased revenues from our loss allowance oil resulting from higher crude oil prices and ii increased revenues from the trenton pipeline system resulting from our expansion activities on that system 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of a reduction in tariff rates that were voluntarily lowered to encourage third party shippers 
pipeline segment profit was reduced by approximately million because of these market rate adjustments 
as a result of these lower tariffs on barrels shipped by us in connection with our gathering and marketing activities  segment profit from gmt s was increased by a comparable amount  an increase of  barrels per day and million of revenues in as compared to from the pipelines acquired in the capline acquisition  reflecting the inclusion of these systems for the entire period as compared to only a portion of the period  and an increase of  barrels per day and million of revenues in as compared to from other businesses acquired in volumes and revenues from pipeline systems acquired in increased in as compared to  reflecting the following an increase in as compared to of  barrels per day and million of revenues from the pipelines acquired in the red river acquisition  reflecting increased tariff rates on the system  partially related to the quality of crude oil shipped  an increase of million of revenues related to higher realized prices on our loss allowance oil  and an increase of  barrels per day and million of revenues in compared to from other businesses acquired in  primarily related to higher volumes 
revenues from all other pipeline systems also increased in  along with a slight increase in volumes 
the increase in revenues is related to several items including the appreciation of canadian currency the canadian to us dollar exchange rate appreciated to an average of to for compared to an average of to in  and volume increases on certain of our systems  partially related to a shift of certain minor pipeline systems from our gmt s segment 
average daily volumes from our tariff activities increased to approximately million barrels per day in compared to  while revenues increased to million 
the increase primarily relates to volumes and revenues from pipeline systems acquired in  reflecting the following the inclusion of an average of  barrels per day and million in revenues from the pipelines acquired in the link acquisition  the inclusion of an average of approximately  barrels per day and million of revenues from the capline pipeline system  and  barrels per day and million of revenues from other acquisitions 
several other factors impacted the increase in to a lesser extent inclusion for the full year of of several pipeline systems acquired during as compared to only a portion of the year in  coupled with higher realized prices on our loss allowance oil  revenues from all other pipeline systems increased in  primarily related to slightly higher volumes on various systems  and the appreciation of canadian currency the canadian to us dollar exchange rate appreciated to an average of to for the year ended december   compared to an average of to in the year ended december  
maintenance capital for the periods ended december   and  maintenance capital expenditures for our pipeline segment were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations as of december   we owned approximately million barrels of active above ground crude oil terminalling and storage facilities  including a crude oil terminalling and storage facility at cushing  oklahoma 
the cushing interchange is one of the largest crude oil market hubs in the united states and the designated delivery point for nymex crude oil futures contracts 
terminals are facilities where crude oil is transferred to or from storage or a transportation system  such as a pipeline  to another transportation system  such as trucks or another pipeline 
the operation of these facilities is called terminalling 
approximately million barrels of our million barrels of tankage is used primarily in our gmt s segment and the balance is used in our pipeline segment 
on a stand alone basis  segment profit from terminalling and storage activities is dependent on the throughput of volumes  the volume of crude oil stored and the level of fees generated from our terminalling and storage services 
our terminalling and storage activities are integrated with our gathering and marketing activities and thus the level of tankage that we allocate for our arbitrage activities and therefore not available for lease to third parties varies throughout crude oil price cycles 
this integration enables us to use our storage tanks in an effort to counter cyclically balance and hedge our gathering and marketing activities 
in a contango market when oil prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we use our tankage to improve our gathering margins by storing crude oil we have purchased at lower prices in the current month for delivery at higher prices in future months 
in a backwardated market when oil prices for future deliveries are lower than for current deliveries  we use less storage capacity  but increased marketing margins premiums for prompt delivery resulting from high demand provide an offset to this reduced cash flow 
in addition  we supplement the counter cyclical balance of our asset base with derivative hedging activities 
we believe that this combination of our terminalling and storage activities  gathering and marketing activities and our hedging activities provides a counter cyclical balance that has a stabilizing effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
we also believe that this balance enables us to protect against downside risk while at the same time providing us with upside opportunities in volatile market conditions 
our revenues from gathering and marketing activities reflect the sale of gathered and bulk purchased crude oil and lpg volumes  plus the sale of additional barrels exchanged through buy sell arrangements entered into to supplement the margins of the gathered and bulk purchased volumes 
because the commodities that we buy and sell are generally indexed to the same pricing indices for both the purchase and the sale  revenues and costs related to purchases will increase and decrease with changes in market prices 
however  the margins related to those purchases and sales will not necessarily have corresponding increases and decreases 
as an example of the potential lack of correlation between changes in revenues and changes in segment profit  our revenues increased approximately in compared to  while our segment profit more than doubled in the same period 
these increases in segment profit are discussed further below 
we do not anticipate that future changes in revenues will be a primary driver of segment profit 
generally  we expect our segment profit to increase or decrease directionally with increases or decreases in lease gathered volumes and lpg sales volumes 
however  certain market conditions create opportunities that may significantly impact segment profit 
although we believe that the combination of our lease gathering business and our storage assets provides a counter cyclical balance that provides stability in our margins  these margins are not fixed and may vary from period to period 
revenues from our gmt s operations were approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in revenues for as compared to and was primarily because of higher crude oil prices 
the average nymex price for crude oil was  and per barrel for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in order to evaluate the performance of this segment  management focuses on the following metrics i segment profit  ii crude oil lease gathered volumes and lpg sales volumes and iii segment profit per barrel calculated on these volumes 
the following table sets forth our operating results from our gmt s segment for the comparative periods indicated december  in millions  except per barrel amounts operating results revenues purchases and related costs field operating costs excluding ltip charge ltip charge operations segment g a expenses excluding ltip charge ltip charge general and administrative segment profit sfas mark to market adjustment maintenance capital segment profit per barrel average daily volumes thousands of barrels per day crude oil lease gathering lpg sales revenues and purchases and related costs include intersegment amounts

volumes associated with these arrangements were approximately   and  barrels per day for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the previously referenced amounts include certain estimates based on management s judgment  such estimates are not expected to have a material impact on the balances 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
amounts related to sfas are included in revenues and impact segment profit 
includes purchases associated with buy sell arrangements of  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
volumes associated with these arrangements were approximately   and  barrels per day for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the previously referenced amounts include certain estimates based on management s judgment  such estimates are not expected to have a material impact on the balances 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
purchases and related costs include interest expense on contango inventory purchases of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
segment g a expenses reflect direct costs attributable to each segment and an allocation of other expenses to the segments based on the business activities that existed at that time 
the proportional allocations by segment require judgment by management and will continue to be based on the business activities that exist during each year 
calculated based on crude oil lease gathered volumes and lpg sales volumes 
volumes associated with acquisitions represent total volumes for the number of days we actually owned the assets divided by the number of days in the period 
segment profit in increased significantly over the increase was primarily related to very favorable market conditions and successful execution of risk management strategies coupled with increased volumes and synergies realized from businesses acquired in the last two years 
the primary factors affecting current period results were favorable market conditions these favorable market conditions include a shift in the market structure from a backwardated market with a price differential of as much as per barrel in late to a prolonged and pronounced contango market with a price differential of as much as in the contango market averaged approximately   and in each quarter of  respectively 
although we are normally adversely impacted by the initial transition from a backwardated market to a contango market  the market remained in contango throughout much of and we have been able to adjust our purchases at the wellhead to both maintain our margins and remain competitive in the gathering and marketing business 
in addition  we have been able to use a portion of our tankage in our terminalling and storage business to capture a significant level of profits from contango related strategies 
the volatile market allowed us to utilize our hedging activities to optimize and enhance the margins of both our gathering and marketing assets and our terminalling and storage assets at different times during the year 
increased receipts of foreign crude oil movements at our facilities also positively impacted our results 
increased tankage used in our gmt s operations the positive impact of the favorable market conditions discussed above was further enhanced by the increase in the average amount of tankage used in our gmt s operations to approximately million barrels during as compared to an average of million barrels in decreased transportation costs lower tariffs on barrels shipped by us on certain pipelines acquired in the link acquisition reduced purchases and related costs by approximately million for the year ended december  segment profit for our pipeline segment was decreased by a comparable amount 
increased field operating costs the increased costs primarily related to payroll and benefits and to higher fuel costs 
these increases are the result of our growth  primarily from acquisitions  and higher fuel prices during as compared to we recognized a mark to market adjustment of million net loss in pursuant to sfas compared to a net gain of million in the the million adjustment was largely attributable to us commodities 
the primary components of the adjustment included a decrease in the mark to market of approximately million resulting from the change in fair value for option and futures contracts that serve to mitigate risk associated with our lease gathering and tankage business exposures 
although these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  their purpose is to mitigate risk associated with our physical assets in our storage and terminalling activities and contractual arrangements in our lease gathering activities 
a portion of the decrease in fair value during the current period relates to the settlement of mark to market gains from the previous period 
total settlements related to these strategies during were revenues of million 
the million further breaks down as follows the amount of the decrease in the mark to market fair value for option contracts was approximately million 
because our option activity often involves option sales  these do not receive hedge accounting treatment 
some of the fluctuations in value for those option contracts are due to time to expiry and volatility in the marketplace 
because these strategies are executed with a long term risk management goal and the intent to take delivery and utilize the tankage assets to store physical commodity if so needed  the impact on forward positions due to these fluctuations is not indicative of true anticipated economic results 
the amount of the decrease in the mark to market fair value for futures contracts was approximately million 
the majority of this decrease was due to reduced backwardation during that time frame 
in general  revenue from storing crude oil is reduced in a backwardated market when oil prices for future deliveries are lower than for current deliveries as there is less incentive to store crude oil from month to month 
we enter into derivative contracts that will offset the reduction in revenue by generating offsetting gains in a backwardated market structure 
because the tankage arrangements will not necessarily result in physical delivery  they are not eligible for hedge accounting treatment under sfas a reduction in backwardation results in forward losses in our risk management strategies offset by stronger storage revenues 
however  owning the assets and having the ability to take delivery allows us to limit exposures to the cost of storage 
an increase in the mark to market of million primarily related to the change in fair value of certain derivative instruments used to minimize the risk of unfavorable changes in exchange rates 
a portion of the increase in fair value during the current period relates to the settlement of mark to market losses from the previous period 
total settlements related to these derivatives during were million 
segment profit per barrel calculated based on our lease gathered crude oil and lpg volumes was  and per barrel for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as discussed above  our current period results were strongly impacted by favorable market conditions 
we are not able to predict with any reasonable level of accuracy whether market conditions will remain as favorable as we have recently experienced  and operating results may not be indicative of sustainable performance 
maintenance capital for the periods ended december   and  maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million  million  and million  respectively  for our gathering  marketing  terminalling and storage operations segment 
the year over year increases are related to our growth 
other income and expenses depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in relates primarily to i an increased amount of depreciable assets resulting from our acquisition activities and capital projects  ii accelerated depreciation and amortization for tanks that we plan to take out of service by  and iii a non cash loss related to sales of assets 
the increase in relates primarily to the assets from our acquisitions and our various acquisitions being included for the full year versus only a part of the year in in addition  includes approximately million of depreciation of trucks and trailers under capital leases and an impairment charge of approximately million associated with taking our pipeline system in the illinois basin out of service 
amortization of debt issue costs was million in  million in  and million in interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense is primarily impacted by our average debt balances  the level and maturity of fixed rate debt and interest rates associated therewith  and market interest rates and our interest rate hedging activities on floating rate debt 
the following table summarizes selected components of our average debt balances for the year ended december  in millions fixed rate senior notes borrowings under our revolving credit facilities total weighted average face amount of senior notes  exclusive of discounts 
excludes borrowings under our senior secured hedged inventory facility and other contango inventory related borrowings 
during  we issued million of year senior unsecured notes 
during the third quarter of  we issued million of five year senior unsecured notes and million of year senior unsecured notes 
these issuances resulted in an increase in the average amount of longer term and higher cost fixed rate debt outstanding in to approximately as compared to approximately in and in during  and  the average three month libor rate was   and  respectively 
the overall higher average debt balances in and were primarily related to the portion of our acquisitions that were not financed with equity  coupled with borrowings related to other capital projects 
our weighted average interest rate  excluding commitment and other fees  was approximately in  compared to and in and  respectively 
the net impact of the items discussed above was an increase in interest expense in of approximately million to a total of million 
the higher average debt balance in as compared to resulted in additional interest expense of approximately million  while at the same time our commitment and other fees decreased by approximately million 
our weighted average interest rate  excluding commitment and other fees  was approximately for compared to for the lower weighted average rate decreased interest expense by approximately million in compared to interest costs attributable to borrowings for inventory stored in a contango market are included in purchases and related costs in our gmt s segment profit as we consider interest on these borrowings a direct cost to storing the inventory 
these borrowings are primarily under our senior secured hedged inventory facility 
these costs were approximately million  million and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
outlook this section identifies certain matters of risk and uncertainty that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future 
ongoing acquisition activities 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions regarding potential acquisitions by us of transportation  gathering  terminalling or storage assets and related midstream businesses 
these acquisition efforts often involve assets which  if acquired  could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in an effort to prudently and economically leverage our asset base  knowledge base and skill sets  management has also expanded its efforts to encompass midstream businesses outside of the scope of our current operations  but with respect to which these resources effectively can be applied 
we are presently engaged in discussions and negotiations with various parties regarding the acquisition of assets and businesses described above  but we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms considered favorable to us 
pipeline integrity and storage tank testing compliance 
although we believe our short term estimates of costs under the pipeline integrity management rules and api and similar canadian regulations are reasonable  a high degree of uncertainty exists with respect to estimating such costs  as we continue to test existing assets and as we acquire additional assets 
the dot is currently considering expanding the scope of its pipeline regulation to include certain gathering pipeline systems that are not currently subject to regulation 
this expanded scope could include the establishment of additional pipeline integrity management programs for these newly regulated pipelines 
we do not currently know what  if any  impact this will have on our operating expenses 
however  we cannot assure you that future costs related to the potential programs will not be material 
during  we are expanding an internal review process started in in which we are reviewing various aspects of our pipeline and gathering systems that are not subject to the dot pipeline integrity management rule 
the purpose of this process is to review the surrounding environment  condition and operating history of these pipelines and gathering assets to determine if such assets warrant additional investment or replacement 
accordingly  we may be required as a result of additional dot regulation or we may elect as a result of our own initiatives to spend substantial sums to ensure the integrity of and upgrade our pipeline systems to maintain environmental compliance and  in some cases  we may take pipelines out of service if we believe the cost of upgrades will exceed the value of the pipelines 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate amount or timing of future pipeline integrity expenditures for environmental compliance 
longer term outlook 
our longer term outlook  spanning a period of five or more years  is influenced by many factors affecting the north american midstream energy sector 
some of the more significant trends and factors relating to crude oil include continued overall depletion of us crude oil production 
the continuing convergence of worldwide crude oil supply and demand trends 
aggressive practices in the us to maintain working crude oil inventory levels below historical levels despite rising demand in north america 
industry compliance with the dot s adoption of api for testing and maintenance of storage tanks  which will require significant investments to maintain existing crude oil storage capacity or  alternatively  will result in a reduction of existing storage capacity by the expectation of increased crude oil production from certain north american regions primarily canadian oil sands and deepwater gulf of mexico sources that will  of economic necessity  compete for us markets currently being supplied by non north american foreign crude imports 
we believe the collective impact of these trends  factors and developments  many of which are beyond our control  will result in an increasingly volatile crude oil market that is subject to more frequent short term swings in market prices and grade differentials and shifts in market structure 
in an environment of reduced inventories and tight supply and demand balances  even relatively minor supply disruptions can cause significant price swings  which were evident in conversely  despite a relatively balanced market on a global basis  competition within a given region of the us could cause downward pricing pressure and significantly impact regional crude oil price differentials among crude oil grades and locations 
although we believe our business strategy is designed to manage these trends  factors and potential developments  and that we are strategically positioned to benefit from certain of these developments  there can be no assurance that we will not be negatively affected 
we are also regularly evaluating midstream businesses that are complementary to our existing businesses and that possess attractive long term growth prospects 
through paa vulcan s acquisition of eci in  the partnership entered the natural gas storage business 
although our investment in natural gas storage assets is currently relatively small when considering the partnership s overall size  we intend to grow this portion of our business through future acquisitions and expansion projects 
we believe that strategically located natural gas storage facilities will become increasingly important in supporting the reliability of gas service needs in the united states 
rising demand for natural gas is outpacing domestic natural gas production  creating an increased need for imported natural gas 
a continuation of this trend will result in increased natural gas imports from canada and the gulf of mexico  and lng imports 
we believe our business strategy and expertise in hydrocarbon storage will allow us to grow our natural gas storage platform and benefit from these trends 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership has a defined financial growth strategy that states how we intend to finance our growth and sets forth targeted credit metrics 
we have also established a targeted credit rating 
see items and business and properties financial strategy 
cash generated from operations and our credit facilities are our primary sources of liquidity 
at december   we had working capital of approximately million  approximately million of availability under our committed revolving credit facilities and approximately million of availability under our uncommitted hedged inventory facility 
usage of the credit facilities is subject to compliance with covenants 
we believe we are currently in compliance with all covenants 
cash generated from operations the primary drivers of cash generated from our operations are i the collection of amounts related to the sale of crude oil and lpg and the transportation of crude oil for a fee and ii the payment of amounts related to the purchase of crude oil and lpg and other expenses  principally field operating costs and general and administrative expenses 
the cash settlement from the purchase and sale of crude oil during any particular month typically occurs within thirty days from the end of the month  except in the months that we store inventory because of contango market conditions or in months in which we increase linefill 
the storage of crude oil in periods of a contango market can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period in which we pay for and store the crude oil and the subsequent period in which we receive proceeds from the sale of the crude oil 
when we store the crude oil  we borrow under our credit facilities to pay for the crude oil so the impact on operating cash flow is negative 
conversely  cash flow from operating activities increases during the period in which we collect the cash from the sale of the stored crude oil 
similarly  the level of lpg inventory stored at period end affects our cash flow from operating activities 
our cash flow from operations was million in and reflects cash generated by our recurring operations offset primarily by an increase in inventory of approximately millionoffset by a net decrease in other components of working capital 
the net decrease is primarily related to changes in accounts receivable and payables related to the purchase and sale of crude oil and nymex margin deposits 
cash flow from operating activities was million in and reflects cash generated by our recurring operations that was offset negatively by several factors totaling approximately million 
the primary item was a net increase in hedged crude oil and lpg inventory and linefill in third party assets that was financed with borrowings under our credit facilities approximately million net 
cash flow from operations was also negatively impacted by a decrease of approximately million in prepayments received from counterparties to mitigate credit risk 
our positive cash flow from operating activities for resulted from cash generated by our recurring operations 
in addition  cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted by approximately million related to proceeds received in from the sale of hedged crude oil inventory and negatively impacted by approximately million related to inventory stored at the end of the proceeds from the sale of the stored crude oil were received in the first quarter of in  we also received approximately million of additional prepayments over the balance from counterparties to mitigate our credit risk  and paid approximately million to terminate an interest rate hedge in conjunction with a change in our capital structure 
cash provided by equity and debt financing activities we periodically access the capital markets for both equity and debt financing 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to effectiveness at the time of use  allows us to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of billion of debt or equity securities 
at december   we have approximately billion of unissued securities remaining available under this registration statement 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for each of the last three years  respectively 
our financing activities primarily relate to funding i acquisitions  ii internal capital projects and iii short term working capital and hedged inventory borrowings related to our contango market activities 
our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity offerings  senior notes offerings and borrowings under our credit facilities 
equity offerings 
during the last three years we completed several equity offerings as summarized in the table below 
certain of these offerings involved related parties 
see note to our consolidated financial statements net net net units proceeds units proceeds units proceeds in millions  except units includes our general partner s proportionate capital contribution and is net of costs associated with the offering 
senior notes and credit facilities 
during the three years ended december  we completed the sale of senior unsecured notes as summarized in the table below 
face net year description value proceeds in millions senior notes issued at of face value senior notes issued at of face value senior notes issued at of face value senior notes isued at of face value face value of notes less the applicable discount 
during the year ended december   we had net working capital and short term letter of credit and hedged inventory borrowings of approximately million 
these borrowings are used primarily for purchases of crude oil inventory that was stored 
see cash generated from operations 
during  we also had net repayments on our long term revolving credit facility of approximately million resulting from cash generated from our operations and other financing activities 
during  we had net borrowings under our long term and short term revolving credit facilities of approximately million and during we had net repayments of million 
for further discussion related to our credit facilities and long term debt  see credit facilities and long term debt 
capital expenditures and distributions paid to unitholders and general partners we have made and will continue to make capital expenditures for acquisitions  expansion capital and maintenance capital 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations and the financing activities discussed above 
our primary uses of cash are for our acquisition activities  capital expenditures for internal growth projects and distributions paid to our unitholders and general partners 
see acquisitions and internal growth projects 
the price of the acquisitions includes cash paid  transaction costs and assumed liabilities and net working capital items 
because of the non cash items included in the total price of the acquisition and the timing of certain cash payments  the net cash paid may differ significantly from the total price of the acquisitions completed during the year 
capital expansion projects 
we expect to invest approximately million on internal growth projects during we also expect maintenance capital costs to be approximately million 
our projects include the following projects with the estimated cost for the entire year in millions projects st 
james  louisiana storage facility spraberry system expansion high prairie truck and rail terminals kerrobert tankage and pumps midale truck terminal truck trailers wichita falls tankage other projects subtotal maintenance capital total we believe that we have sufficient liquid assets  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity 
distributions to unitholders and general partner 
we distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of each quarter less reserves established in the discretion of our general partner for future requirements 
total cash distributions made during the last three years were as follows in millions  except per unit amounts distributions paid common subordinated gp distribution year units units incentive total per lp unit the subordinated units were converted to common units in and credit facilities and long term debt in november  we amended our senior unsecured credit facility to increase the aggregate capacity to billion and the sub facility for canadian borrowings to million 
the amended facility can be expanded to billion  subject to additional lender commitments  and has a final maturity of november additionally  in the second quarter of  we amended our senior secured hedged inventory facility to increase the capacity under the facility from million to million 
in november  we extended the maturity of the senior secured hedged inventory facility to november we also have five issues of senior debt outstanding that total million  excluding premium or discount  and range in size from million to million and mature at various dates through the million senior debt includes million principal long term debt issued in  which matures in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our credit agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes contain cross default provisions 
our credit agreements prohibit distributions on  or purchases or redemptions of  units if any default or event of default is continuing 
in addition  the agreements contain various covenants limiting our ability to  among other things incur indebtedness if certain financial ratios are not maintained  grant liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  and sell substantially all of our assets or enter into a merger or consolidation 
our credit facility treats a change of control as an event of default and also requires us to maintain a debt coverage ratio that will not be greater than to on all outstanding debt and to on all outstanding debt during an acquisition period generally  the period consisting of three fiscal quarters following an acquisition greater than million 
for covenant compliance purposes  letters of credit and borrowings to fund hedged inventory and margin requirements are excluded when calculating the debt coverage ratio 
a default under our credit facility would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the outstanding debt 
as long as we are in compliance with our credit agreements  our ability to make distributions of available cash is not restricted 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreements and indentures 
contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commitments contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of doing business we purchase crude oil and lpg from third parties under contracts  the majority of which range in term from thirty day evergreen to three years 
we establish a margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sale and exchange transactions through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil and lpg purchases and sales and future delivery obligations 
the table below includes purchase obligations related to these activities 
where applicable  the amounts presented represent the net obligations associated with buy sell contracts and those subject to a net settlement arrangement with the counterparty 
we do not expect to use a significant amount of internal capital to meet these obligations  as the obligations will be funded by corresponding sales to creditworthy entities 
the following table includes our best estimate of the amount and timing of these payments as well as others due under the specified contractual obligations as of december  and total thereafter in millions long term debt and interest payments leases capital expenditure obligations other long term liabilities subtotal crude oil and lpg purchases total includes debt service payments  interest payments due on our senior notes and the commitment fee on our revolving credit facility 
although there is an outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility at december  this amount is included in the amounts above  we historically repay and borrow at varying amounts 
as such  we have included only the maximum commitment fee as if no amounts were outstanding on the facility in the amounts above 
leases are primarily for office rent and trucks used in our gathering activities 
excludes approximately million non current liability related to sfas which are included in crude oil and lpg purchases 
amounts are based on estimated volumes and market prices 
the actual physical volume purchased and actual settlement prices may vary from the assumptions used in the table 
uncertainties involved in these estimates include levels of production at the wellhead  weather conditions  changes in market prices and other conditions beyond our control 
letters of credit 
in connection with our crude oil marketing  we provide certain suppliers with irrevocable standby letters of credit to secure our obligation for the purchase of crude oil 
our liabilities with respect to these purchase obligations are recorded in accounts payable on our balance sheet in the month the crude oil is purchased 
generally  these letters of credit are issued for periods of up to seventy days and are terminated upon completion of each transaction 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
capital contributions to paa vulcan gas storage  llc 
we and vulcan gas storage are both required to make capital contributions in equal proportions to fund i certain projects specified at the time paa vulcan acquired eci and ii unspecified future capital needs up to an aggregate of million 
for certain other specified projects  vulcan gas storage has the right  but not the obligation  to participate for of the cost 
for any other project or a project in which vulcan gas storage declines to exercise its right to participate  we have the right to make additional capital contributions to fund of the project 
such contributions would increase our interest in paa vulcan and dilute vulcan gas storage s interest 
if at any time our interest in paa vulcan exceeds  vulcan gas storage would have the right  but not the obligation  to make capital contributions proportionate to its ownership interest at the time 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
distributions 
we plan to distribute of our available cash within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to our general partner 
available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the quarter less reserves established in the discretion of our general partner for future requirements 
on february   we paid a cash distribution of per unit on all outstanding units 
the total distribution paid was approximately million  with approximately million paid to our common unitholders and approximately million paid to our general partner for its general partner interest million and incentive distribution interest million 
our general partner is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in our partnership agreement 
under the quarterly incentive distribution provisions  our general partner is entitled  without duplication  to of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit  of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit and of amounts we distribute in excess of per limited partner unit 
in  we paid million in incentive distributions to our general partner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in i crude oil and lpg commodity prices  ii interest rates and iii currency exchange rates 
we utilize various derivative instruments to manage such exposure and  in certain circumstances  to realize incremental margin during volatile market conditions 
in analyzing our risk management activities  we draw a distinction between enterprise level risks and trading related risks 
enterprise level risks are those that underlie our core businesses and may be managed based on whether there is value in doing so 
conversely  trading related risks the risks involved in trading in the hopes of generating an increased return are not inherent in the core business  rather  those risks arise as a result of engaging in the trading activity 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor interest rates  currency exchange rates  nymex  ipe and over the counter positions  and physical volumes  grades  locations and delivery schedules to ensure our hedging activities address our market risks 
we have a risk management function that has direct responsibility and authority for our risk policies and our trading controls and procedures and certain aspects of corporate risk management 
our risk management function also approves all new risk management strategies through a formal process 
with the exception of the controlled trading program discussed below  our approved strategies are intended to mitigate enterprise level risks that are inherent in our core businesses of gathering and marketing and storage 
to hedge the risks discussed above we engage in risk management activities that we categorize by the risks we are hedging 
the following discussion addresses each category of risk 
commodity price risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to crude oil and lpg in storage  and expected purchases and sales of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures and option contracts traded on the nymex  ipe and over the counter transactions  including crude oil swap and option contracts entered into with financial institutions and other energy companies 
our policy is to purchase only crude oil for which we have a market  and to structure our sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the segment profit we receive 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on crude oil price changes  as these activities could expose us to significant losses 
although we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our crude oil lease purchase and lpg activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of production  transportation and delivery variances as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our core business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of crude oil 
although the intent of our risk management strategies is to hedge our margin  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 
in such instances  changes in the fair values of these derivatives will receive mark to market treatment in current earnings  and result in greater potential for earnings volatility 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note to our consolidated financial statements 
all of our open commodity price risk derivatives at december  were categorized as non trading 
the fair value of these instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent price decrease are shown in the table below effect of fair value price decrease in millions crude oil futures contracts swaps and options contracts lpg swaps and options contracts the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
the assumptions used in these estimates as well as the source for the estimates is maintained by the independent risk control function 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the cash market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
interest rate risk we use both fixed and variable rate debt  and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
therefore  from time to time we use interest rate swaps and collars to hedge interest obligations on specific debt issuances  including anticipated debt issuances 
we had no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding as of december  the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for variable rate debt outstanding at december  all of our senior notes are fixed rate notes and their interest rates are not subject to market risk
