item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with an overview to give the reader management s perspective on our results for fiscal and our general outlook for the next fiscal year 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
this discussion is followed by a review of our recent  significant acquisitions 
in the next section  we discuss our results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal we then discuss the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements on our future reported results and provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents this md a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form k  including risk factors  business and selected financial data above and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
md a contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the risk factors section above 
our actual results may differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements 
overview fiscal proved to be a solid year of improvement for us  as we extended our leadership in business service management bsm and introduced new offerings that broaden and deepen our bsm portfolio 
leading industry analyst firms have validated bsm as a primary way for it organizations to proactively and effectively align with the goals of business 
they expect the number of companies implementing bsm to increase substantially within the next few years 
we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this important market trend 
we have developed the only second generation  completely federated configuration management database or cmdb 
it is an essential first step for implementing bsm 
the bmc atrium cmdb is the only all in one integrated  federated solution 
our research identified transaction management as a large and emerging market 
through the combination of internal development and an acquisition  we responded to a key customer need identifying  analyzing  and resolving problems that affect transactions before they impact critical business services 
during the fourth quarter  we introduced bmc transaction management solutions  which provide the tools needed to measure and manage the performance of business transactions from the end user perspective across complex  heterogeneous computing environments 
in connection with this  we announced our fourth quarter acquisition of identify software ltd 
identify  a leading global provider of application problem resolution and lifecycle management software 
identify s state of the art technology offers problem resolution capabilities that directly impact the way that it serves a customer s business goals 
identify s product has unique transaction problem resolution capabilities through root cause analysis  capture  and playback 
we view this as a growth opportunity for us  as we now have access to buyers in the application testing and development market 
identify is now part of our new transaction management organization 
our acquisition of identify and our more significant business combinations are discussed in greater detail under acquisitions below 
we also continue to realize the positive benefits of our cost management actions earlier in the year  in terms of improved operating efficiency and profitability 
during the first quarter  we implemented a plan focused mainly on reducing and aligning costs with revenues and eliminating excess overhead 
this fiscal plan is discussed in greater detail under results of operations below 
we continued our commitment to enhance shareholder value by significantly increasing the cash returned to shareholders through our stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares for a total value of million 
during fiscal  we continued to emphasize the importance of providing the flexibility that our customers need when it comes to structuring their license arrangements 
as we met those customer preferences  we again reported an increase in the volume of transactions that required deferral of license fees and recognition of such fees ratably over the terms of the contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of our license transactions were deferred as compared to approximately in fiscal given the continued increase in deferred license revenue during fiscal  license transactions remains a key metric for us as it reflects the amount of new license contracts bookings signed during a given period 
license transactions can be calculated from our consolidated financial statements by adding current period license revenue  
table of contents the net change in deferred license revenue and the beginning balance allocated from acquisitions  all calculated according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our license transactions for fiscal declined from fiscal as our distributed systems management and mainframe management businesses had lower license transactions  which paralleled industry performance 
the service management and identity management businesses  integral to our bsm strategy  experienced strong license transactions growth 
we believe it s appropriate to focus on license transactions or bookings growth as a leading indicator of the performance of our service management and identity management businesses  given their high growth potential 
for fiscal  service management license bookings were up  and identity management license bookings rose 
it is important for our investors to understand that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant amount of our license transactions are completed during the final weeks and days of each quarter  and therefore we generally do not know whether revenues have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter  there is an immediate  sometimes significant  effect on our overall earnings and our stock price 
industry conditions while the overall it spending environment has stabilized  it budgets have remained relatively flat 
additionally  it organizations continue to be pressured by their business counterparts to lower overall operational costs while increasing support for regulatory compliance  strategic objectives and other projects focused on delivering increased value to the business 
while our bsm solutions allow our customers to improve their it processes and effectively align it with business needs  the demands placed on customers it organizations have resulted in an environment less conducive to closing large deals and increased pricing pressures on technology vendors 
while we believe bsm differentiates us from our competitors  we recognize that the systems management software market place is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of software vendors  including large vendors such as ibm  hp  ca  and a number of smaller software vendors 
we compete for new customers and  from time to time  must compete to maintain our relationships with our current customers 
this competition can lead to pricing pressure and can affect our margins 
we discuss competition in greater detail under business and risk factors above 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we make and evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software development costs  acquired technology  in process research and development  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of investments and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amounts and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets  and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures below 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing software  providing maintenance  enhancement and support for previously licensed products and  to a lesser extent  from providing professional services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions for all transactions including the sale of software licenses and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following four criteria are met i a legally binding  written arrangement is executed  ii delivery has occurred and acceptance  to the extent required  is received  iii arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the arrangement fee is deemed probable 
if we determine that any one of the four criteria is not met  we will defer recognition of revenue until all the criteria are met  as required by sops and license revenues consist of fees charged for the use of our software products licensed under perpetual or term agreements 
substantially all of our software licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements ie  licenses are sold either with maintenance or with maintenance and professional services 
perpetual license revenues included in multiple element arrangements are recognized under the residual method  such that the consideration is allocated to the various other undelivered elements included in the agreement based upon the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of those elements  with the residual being allocated to license revenues 
revenues allocated to the undelivered elements of a contract are deferred until such time as those elements are delivered or the services are rendered 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance through the renewal rates in the contractual arrangements with our customers and through independent sales of maintenance at these stated renewal rates 
these renewal rates reflect a consistent relationship by pricing maintenance as a percentage of the discounted or undiscounted license list price 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of professional services is based on the daily rates determined from our contracts for services alone  which are time and materials based 
in the event a contract contains multiple elements for which we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  all revenues from the contract are deferred until such evidence is established or deferred until those elements are delivered or are recognized on a ratable basis 
we have not established vendor specific objective evidence for undelivered elements in arrangements which include software products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices  certain arrangements which include unlimited licensing rights  arrangements which include products with differing maintenance periods and arrangements which include rights to future unspecified software licenses 
license arrangements including these undelivered elements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
term license arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of maintenance in these arrangements 
when software licenses are sold together with professional services  the majority of license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the product as we do not provide significant customization of software products and the professional services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
we also execute arrangements with agents  distributors and resellers collectively  resellers 
resellers act as the principals in the transactions with the end users of our software  and the rewards of ownership are passed to the resellers upon the execution of our arrangement with them 
we recognize revenues from transactions with resellers on a net basis the amount actually received by us from the resellers 
we do not offer a right of return  rotation or price protection in our sales to resellers  and it is our policy to only accept orders from resellers that specifically name an end user 
revenues from license and maintenance transactions that are financed are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment  as we have a history of offering installment contracts to customers and successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
if the fee under an arrangement is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when payments become due under the arrangement 
if we determine that a transaction is not probable of collection or the risk of concession is considered to be high  we recognize revenue upon cash receipt 
capitalized software development costs 
table of contents costs of internally developed software are expensed until the technological feasibility of the software product has been established 
thereafter  software development costs are capitalized until the product s general release to customers in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated economic life beginning at the date of general availability of the product to our customers 
under sfas no 
 we evaluate our capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
any such excess is written off through accelerated amortization in the quarter it is identified 
determining net realizable value as defined by sfas no 
requires that we make estimates and use judgment in quantifying the appropriate amount to write off  if any 
actual amounts realized from the software products could differ from our estimates 
also  any future changes to our product portfolio could result in significant increases to our cost of license revenues as a result of the write off of capitalized software development costs 
the impact of accelerated amortization on fiscal  and results is discussed in greater detail under results of operations cost of license revenues below 
acquired technology  in process research and development  goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to acquired technology  in process research and development and identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships 
the excess of our cost over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the amounts allocated to acquired technology  in process research and development and intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date 
the fair values are estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach  which requires us to project the related future revenues and expenses and apply an appropriate discount rate 
once the acquired assets are recorded  we amortize the acquired technology and intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated lives 
we analyze the realizability of our acquired technology each quarter 
all goodwill and those intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value has been reduced below carrying value 
when conducting these realizability and impairment assessments  we are required to estimate future cash flows 
the estimates used in valuing all intangible assets  including in process research and development  are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value and to estimate useful lives 
incorrect estimates of fair value and or useful lives could result in impairment charges and those charges could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
valuation of investments our investments primarily consist of marketable debt and equity securities 
we account for our marketable investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we regularly analyze our portfolio of marketable securities for impairment 
this analysis requires significant judgment 
the primary factors considered when determining if an impairment charge must be recorded because a decline in the fair value of a marketable security is other than temporary include whether i the fair value of the investment is significantly below our cost basis  ii the financial condition of the issuer of the security has deteriorated  iii if a debt security  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  iv the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time  v if a debt security  such security has been downgraded by a rating agency  and vi we have the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we have investment policies which are designed to ensure that our assets are invested in capital preserving securities 
however  from time to time  issuer specific and market specific events  as described above  could warrant an impairment write down 
as the vast majority of our marketable securities are investment grade debt securities  we anticipate that any future impairment charges related to these investments will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
marketable securities with a fair value below our cost as of march  and are discussed in greater detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes 
table of contents we account for the effect of income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year s results and for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we are required to make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine i our income tax expense or benefit  ii our deferred tax assets and liabilities and iii whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic including state and foreign authorities 
these factors significantly impact the amounts we record related to income taxes 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates related to the realizability of our deferred tax assets take into account positive and negative evidence about possible sources of taxable income available under the tax laws to realize the tax benefit  including projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and the amounts that may be realized utilizing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of taxable income in future years could differ from our estimates and the related impact on our income tax expense or benefit could materially affect our consolidated results of operations 
we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in multiple jurisdictions and our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that may result from the examination of our tax returns that have been filed in these jurisdictions 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires significant judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
we also have various domestic and foreign income tax exposures that do not meet the probable and or estimable criteria of sfas no 
and therefore no tax expense has been accrued 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these exposures could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
acquisitions in february  we acquired the assets of magic from mcafee  formerly known as network associates  for million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities of magic 
the acquisition strengthened our leadership position in the service management market by increasing our reach to small and mid market sized organizations  as magic had more than  customers using its service desk solutions 
the acquisition of marimba in july for million in cash plus stock options valued at million provided new and extended capabilities to our bsm offerings in the areas of change and configuration management  security management and infrastructure management  enabling our customers to rapidly respond to changing business requirements by re purposing  re provisioning and updating it resources to achieve required it configurations 
in january  we acquired calendra for million in cash  and in march  we acquired the assets of opennetwork for cash of million plus the assumption of certain liabilities of opennetwork 
these two acquisitions completed our transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a complete suite provider 
the combination of our control sa provisioning solution with calendra s state of the art business process centric workflow and directory management capabilities  eliminated integration issues typically faced by customers purchasing individual components from multiple vendors 
the opennetwork acquisition expanded our identity management product suite to include browser based authentication and authorization solutions that enable customers to securely manage access to web based applications across multiple business environments 
in august  we acquired kmxperts inc for cash of million 
the acquisition strengthens our knowledge management solutions for it service and customer support centers 
these transactions  along with various other less significant technology acquisitions  have been accounted for using the purchase accounting method  and accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 

table of contents subsequent to fiscal  on may   bmc software israel  limited  an israeli company and wholly owned subsidiary of bmc israel  and bmc completed the acquisition of identify software ltd  an israeli company  pursuant to which bmc israel purchased from the shareholders of identify software ltd 
all of the issued and outstanding capital stock for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition extends capabilities to our bsm offerings in the area of transaction management through identify software ltd 
s application problem resolution software 
the addition of identify software ltd s solutions to bmc s transaction management strategy will provide customers with deep application and problem resolution capabilities  enabling them to pinpoint the cause of transaction breakdowns 
historical information historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income loss or net earnings loss will be sustained at these levels

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal we acquired marimba and other smaller companies in fiscal  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of companies acquired in fiscal and  total revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a decline in license revenues

including revenues of acquired companies  total revenues increased in fiscal product revenue growth was not materially impacted by inflation in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues grew in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a growth in maintenance revenues  partially offset by a decline in license revenues 
our maintenance revenues have grown year over year in each of our product categories primarily due to an increase in our installed customer base

distributed systems management license revenues represented  or million   or million  and  or million  of our total license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
distributed systems management license revenues decreased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in license transactions across all products 
the decline in license transactions was primarily for our distributed systems data management products as a result of increased competition from database providers in this market and for our patrol products as we are undergoing a product transition for this product line  integrating our agent based and agentless patrol technologies 
distributed systems management license revenues decreased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in license transactions year over year due to increased competitive pressure in the markets we serve

total license revenues for identity management decreased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal our acquisitions of calendra in january and opennetwork in march gave us the tools to transition from being a point product provider in the identity management market to a suite provider 
total license revenues for identity management decreased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced sales declines as we transitioned the new calendra and opennetwork acquisitions 
in the second half of fiscal  we released idm  completing the transition of bmc to a complete suite provider which resulted in less of a year over year decline than experienced in the prior year 
identity management maintenance revenues represented  or million   or million  and  or million  of our total maintenance revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance revenue for identity management saw a strong growth rate in fiscal due to an increase in our installed customer base as well as continued maintenance renewals 
product license revenues our product license revenues primarily consist of fees related to products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis 
product license fees can be associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on additional computing capacity or for additional users 
our license revenues also include term license fees which are generated when customers are granted license rights to a given software product for a defined period of time 
license revenues decreased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal and  or million  from fiscal to fiscal the continued decrease in license revenues is the result of the negative impact of a highly competitive  mature mainframe management market and the increased competitive pressure in our distributed systems management market  partially offset by the positive impact of our increased market share in service management 
the decrease in license revenue is the combined result of a decrease in total transactions and a decrease in the percentage of new license sales recognized upfront 
recognized license revenues plus the net change in deferred license revenues for the period  representing the license value of transactions completed in the period  decreased during fiscal and fiscal compared to the respective prior year periods 
the value of license transactions for fiscal and were down and  respectively  from the prior year periods 
we closed transactions over million during fiscal  including two transactions over million  a decrease from such transactions  including two transactions over million  in fiscal and a decrease from such transactions in fiscal  including four transactions over million 
the total license value of these transactions in fiscal was million  including amounts recognized and deferred  compared to million and million for these transactions in fiscal and  respectively 
of the current fiscal year transactions  the percentage of revenue recognized upfront has decreased from a year ago to 
term contracts are time based arrangements which allow the licensee or customer to use our software for a specified period of time 
thus  the associated value of the contract is recognized ratably over the life of the contract 

table of contents deferred product license revenues for fiscal  and  our recognized license revenues were impacted by the changes in our deferred license revenue balance as follows year ended march  in millions deferrals of license revenue recognition from deferred license revenue net impact on recognized license revenue deferred license revenue balance at end of year the primary reasons for license revenue deferrals include customer transactions that contain certain complex contractual terms and conditions  customer transactions which include products for which the maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices  certain arrangements which include unlimited licensing rights  time based licenses which are recognized over the term of the arrangement  or customer transactions which include products with differing maintenance periods and other transactions for which we do not have or are not able to determine vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the maintenance and or professional services 
all of these instances cause the license revenues to be deferred under the residual method of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
the contract terms and conditions that result in deferral of revenue recognition for a given transaction result from arm s length negotiations between us and our customers 
we anticipate our transactions will continue to include such contract terms that result in deferral of the related license revenues as we expand our offerings to meet customers product  pricing and licensing needs 
once it is determined that license revenue for a particular contract must be deferred  based on the contractual terms and application of revenue recognition policies to those terms  we recognize such license revenue either ratably over the term of the contract or when the revenue recognition criteria are met 
because of this  we generally know the timing of the subsequent recognition of license revenue at the time of deferral 
therefore  the amount of license revenues to be recognized out of the deferred revenue balance in each future quarter is generally predictable  and our total license revenues to be recognized each quarter become more predictable as a larger percentage of those revenues come from the deferred license revenue balance 
as of march   the deferred license revenue balance was million and had an average remaining life of approximately three years 
as additional license revenues are deferred in future periods  the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase 
a summary of the estimated deferred license revenues we expect to recognize in future periods as of march  is as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter maintenance  enhancement and support revenues maintenance  enhancement and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
maintenance  enhancement and support enrollment generally entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems  networks  storage systems and applications 
these fees are generally charged annually and are based on the discounted license list price for legacy bmc software products and a percentage of the undiscounted license list price for service management and identity management products 
customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance percentages for entering into long term maintenance contracts that include prepayment of the maintenance fees or that are supported by a formal financing arrangement 
the majority of our maintenance revenues are generated by such long term contracts 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any initial maintenance services covered by the related license agreement 
maintenance revenues can have quarterly fluctuations based on the timing of contracts  renewal rates and the number of new license contracts 
maintenance fees increase with new license and maintenance agreements and as 
table of contents existing customers install our products on additional processing capacity or add users 
however  discounts on licensed products tend to increase for purchases with higher levels of processing capacity  so that maintenance fees on a per unit of capacity basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements 
these discounts  combined with an increase in long term maintenance contracts with reduced maintenance percentages and the reduced number of new license contracts  excluding our service management products  have led to a lower fiscal growth rate for our maintenance revenues 
maintenance revenues increased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal and  or million  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of the increase in our installed customer base in all core product categories 
as of march   the deferred maintenance revenue balance was  million 
as additional maintenance revenues are deferred in future periods  the amounts to be recognized in future periods will increase

table of contents fiscal exit activities and related costs during the first quarter ended june   we implemented a plan fy plan to reduce costs and realign resources to focus on growth areas 
the fy plan included the involuntary termination of employees 
the workforce reduction was across all functions and geographies and affected employees were provided cash separation packages 
the workforce reduction has reduced selling and general and administrative expenses in product areas that are not realizing our profitability and growth goals

amortization of intangible assets under the purchase accounting method for acquisitions  portions of the purchase prices for our acquisitions were allocated to other intangible assets  including tradenames 
through march   most of our acquired tradenames were not amortized because the assets were deemed to have indefinite remaining useful lives 
however  as a result of a re branding campaign  we changed the estimated economic useful lives  effective april   of acquired tradenames from indefinite to between one and two years 
the carrying amount of the previously unamortized tradenames at march  was million and is being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful life commencing april  for the year ended march   the pre tax and after tax increase in amortization expense resulting from this change in estimate was million and million  respectively  and the reduction to basic and diluted earnings per share was 
amortization of intangible assets increased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to acquisitions in prior years 
amortization of intangible assets increased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the aforementioned change in estimate  partially offset by the conclusion of amortization of certain other intangibles 
acquired research and development during fiscal and  we wrote off acquired in process research and development ipr d totaling million in connection with the acquisition of magic of the purchase price and million in connection with the acquisitions of viadyne  calendra and opennetwork collectively  of the aggregate purchase price  respectively 
the amounts allocated to ipr d represent the estimated fair values  based on risk adjusted cash flows and historical costs expended  related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the dates of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates  during fiscal and during fiscal  there was no write off of ipr d 
in making the purchase price allocations to ipr d  we considered present value calculations of income  analyses of project accomplishments and remaining outstanding items  assessments of overall contributions  as well as project risks 
the values assigned to purchased in process technology were determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on our estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses and income taxes from such projects 
a risk adjusted discount rate was applied to the cash flows of each of the products projected income streams for the five years following the acquisition 
these discount rates assume that the risk of revenue streams for new technology is higher than that of existing revenue streams 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were generally derived from a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted upward to reflect the additional risks inherent in the development life cycle  including the useful life of the technology  profitability levels of the 
table of contents technology and the uncertainty of technology advances that are known at the transaction date 
product specific risk includes the stages of completion of each product  the complexity of the development work completed to date  the likelihood of achieving technological feasibility and market acceptance 
the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value 
impairment of goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  after the annual planning process is complete 
primarily due to reduced operating results in fiscal  including the increased use of third party implementation services  the projected profitability and cash flows of the professional services segment were reduced 
as a result  the goodwill of million assigned to the professional services segment was considered totally impaired during fiscal the fair value of the professional services reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method of applying the income approach 
there were no impairments of goodwill in fiscal and fiscal settlement of litigation we settled our dispute with nastel technologies  inc during fiscal the settlement payment of million covers all claims involved in this action 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and finance receivables  rental income on owned facilities  gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and interest expense on capital leases 
other income  net was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
other income  net  increased  or million  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an million gain realized on the sale of previously securitized finance receivables as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by net losses of million on marketable securities in fiscal and a decrease as a result of the non recurring gain on patrol storage manager in the prior year 
other income  net remained constant from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an million gain realized on the sale of previously securitized finance receivables in fiscal being fully offset by higher interest income generated from higher average investment portfolio balances receiving higher rates 
income tax provision benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal  an income tax expense of million in fiscal and an income tax expense of million in fiscal our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the tax cost of repatriation under the american jobs creation act of  the tax effect attributable to our foreign earnings net of us tax consequences  changes in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  benefits attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion and non recurring adjustments to our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes 
in fiscal  the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax expense of approximately million related to the repatriation of approximately million of qualified earnings under the applicable provisions of the american jobs creation act of the act 
in fiscal  the most significant item impacting our effective tax rate was a tax benefit of million recorded as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance that was previously recorded against our deferred tax assets  as discussed below 
the other significant item impacting our fiscal effective tax rate was an expense of million to adjust our aggregate net liabilities for income taxes  withholding taxes and income tax exposures that were found to be understated after a 
table of contents thorough analysis of all of our income tax accounts in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal  the most significant item impacting the effective tax rate was the establishment of a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets  as discussed below 
for a detailed analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in evaluating our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our past operating results  tax planning strategies and our forecast of future taxable income 
in considering these sources of taxable income  we must make certain assumptions and judgments that are based on the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying business 
changes in our assumptions  plans and estimates may materially impact our income tax expense 
we can support a large portion of our net deferred tax asset through the evaluation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets 
our tax planning strategies primarily involve the acceleration of royalty and cost sharing payments under agreements that are currently in place between bmc software and its foreign affiliates 
under these agreements  the acceleration of such payments is at our sole discretion 
each year we must evaluate the amount of domestic deferred tax assets that could be supported by the acceleration of these taxable income streams 
in our evaluation we also considered negative evidence such as our inability to carryback losses to earlier tax years 
after a thorough evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence  we concluded that a valuation allowance is not required except for certain specific items discussed below and that our net deferred tax asset as of march  is supportable 
after a thorough evaluation of both the positive and negative evidence for fiscal  we concluded that a valuation allowance was not necessary beyond certain specific items and that our net deferred tax asset as of march  was supportable 
consistent with this judgment  we recorded a million tax benefit as part of the total income tax expense for fiscal  for the reversal of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we also reduced our valuation allowance and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of million for tax benefits attributable to non qualified stock option exercises in prior years that resided in the net operating loss carryforwards that were utilized in fiscal during fiscal  we evaluated all available positive and negative evidence and concluded that a valuation allowance was required for a portion of our deferred tax asset 
sfas no 
also requires the evaluation of the character of income that generated our deferred tax assets and the jurisdictions involved 
our deferred tax assets include losses that are attributable to capital transactions that require future taxable income of a specific character in order to utilize 
in fiscal  we maintained a valuation allowance against this specific asset as we did not have positive evidence that supported the utilization of the capital loss 
subsequent to fiscal  we entered into a firm contract to sell the real estate associated with our corporate headquarters in houston 
we expect this sale to generate sufficient capital gain income to offset our current capital loss deferred tax assets 
we anticipate that this transaction provides the positive evidence necessary to release the valuation allowance that we had established against the capital loss deferred tax assets 
we have also maintained a valuation allowance against a research and development credit acquired as part of the marimba acquisition due to various uncertainties regarding the utilization of this specific asset 
in fiscal  we increased our valuation allowance and recorded an increase to goodwill of million related to this acquired asset 
if this valuation allowance is reduced in a future year  a related reduction to goodwill would be recognized 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our deferred tax assets 
we provide for the us income tax effect on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
at march   we have a deferred tax asset of million related to excess foreign tax credits that are available to offset us income taxes on the earnings that we do not consider indefinitely reinvested under apb opinion no 
as of march   the cumulative earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided were approximately million 
if these earnings were repatriated to the united states or they were no longer determined to be indefinitely reinvested under apb opinion no 
 the potential tax liability for these earnings is approximately million  assuming full utilization of the foreign tax credits associated with these earnings 
the balance of indefinitely reinvested earnings as of fiscal was million 
the balance of million as of fiscal is substantially lower due to the repatriation of the majority of our indefinitely reinvested earnings under the act 

table of contents the american jobs creation act of the act was enacted on october   and provides for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated 
in june  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings 
during fiscal  we executed this plan and repatriated million of foreign earnings and recorded a federal and state tax expense of million associated with these repatriated earnings 
as of march   we have foreign tax credit carryforwards of million that will expire between and and research and development tax credit carryforwards of million net of a million valuation allowance that will expire in and we also have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million that are not subject to expiration 
we have state net operating losses carryforwards of million and foreign net operating losses of million which expire between and that we believe we will be able to utilize 
in addition  there are other state and foreign net operating losses that we do not believe will be utilized and therefore we have not recorded a deferred tax asset related to these losses 
the irs has completed its examination of our federal income tax returns filed for the tax years ended march  and and issued its revenue agent report rar on december  we have filed our protest letter contesting the adjustments included in the rar with the irs appeals division appeals office and expects to start discussions with the appeals office in july we cannot predict the ultimate resolution date of these negotiations with the appeals office 
we are also currently working with the appeals office to resolve the issues raised at examination related to our federal income tax returns filed for the tax years ended march  and we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments raised in each examination  that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made and  therefore  that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
october   the israeli tax authorities ita issued determination of assessments assessments to various israeli affiliates of the company that covered the tax years 
the israeli affiliates filed protests of the assessments with the ita on december  and have requested a hearing to pursue resolution of these assessments with the ita 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments raised in these assessments  that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made  and therefore  that the ultimate resolution of the issues will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   we filed a writ of mandamus in brazil in order to clarify whether or not a tax applies to the remittance of software payments from our brazilian operations 
in response to the filing  the first level court denied our request for preliminary injunction  but the merits of the case have not been analyzed 
we anticipate we will prevail in this matter and intends to continue to pursue a favorable outcome 
we do not expect a resolution in the near future 
the company s income tax provision includes amounts that are intended to cover taxes that are probable and can be reasonably estimated  including amounts associated with the rars and the assessments 
the actual resolution of these income tax audits could lead to an income tax liability that is materially different from the amounts that have been provided 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on evaluating other than temporary impairment for marketable debt and equity securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as well as non marketable equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
the consensus includes a basic three step model to evaluate whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
eitf issue  effective date of paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in eitf issue no 
until the fasb staff provided applicable implementation guidance 
this delay does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature 
during the period of delay  an entity holding investments must continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance 
we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued a proposed staff position fsp  fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application of certain investments fsp fas 
this fsp replaces the guidance set forth in paragraphs through of eitf with references to existing other than 
table of contents temporary impairment guidance  such as sfas no 
fsp fas clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell has not been made 
fsp fas is effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after september  there was no new implementation guidance with respect to debt securities that are impaired solely due to interest rates and or sector spreads in the final fsp 
bmc has incorporated the guidance of fsp fas with the guidance of eitf and fas effective december in assessing impairment of its marketable securities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
in april  the sec issued a rule delaying the required adoption date for sfas no 
r to the first interim period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after june  generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r permits adoption using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning on the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
the company has adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method as of april   the beginning of our fiscal we are currently evaluating option valuation assumptions under the black scholes model in light of fas r and the sec guidance  the assumptions we ultimately use to adopt fas r may be different than those currently used as discussed in note l to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as permitted by sfas no 
 through march   we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options  as the exercise prices of options granted are generally equal to the quoted market price of our common stock on the date of grant  except in limited circumstances when stock options have been exchanged in a business combination 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings loss and earnings loss per share in note l to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
in general  this requirement would reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the excess tax deductions recorded in fiscal were million and was million 
we did not recognize any such tax benefits for fiscal in december  the fsb released staff position fsp sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  which provides a practical transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees 
the company is currently reviewing the transition alternatives and will elect the appropriate alternative within one year of the adoption of sfas r 
liquidity and capital resources one of our major goals is to optimize our capital structure

for fiscal  the decrease in accounts receivables and finance receivables is primarily due to reduced transactions in fiscal for all periods presented  the change in deferred revenues does not impact total operating cash flows as the offset is in earnings 
during fiscal  we paid cash exit costs of million and paid million in taxes 
we continue to finance our operations primarily through funds generated from operations 
our primary source of 
table of contents cash is the sale of our software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
we expect that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operating and investing activities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
if we were to make a significant acquisition in the future  we might find it advantageous to utilize third party financing sources based on factors such as our then available cash and its source ie  cash held in the united states of america versus international locations  the cost of financing and our internal cost of capital 
investing activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from investing activities years ended march  in millions cash paid for technology acquisitions and other investments  net of cash acquired proceeds from maturities sales of marketable securities purchases of marketable securities capitalization of software development costs all other  net net cash used in investing activities during fiscal  we acquired magic and made contractual adjustments to the purchase prices for the fiscal acquisitions 
in fiscal  we acquired marimba  calendra  and opennetwork 
in fiscal  we acquired kmxperts inc our acquisitions are discussed in more detail under acquisitions above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the main component of other cash used in investing activities was purchases of property and equipment  which were primarily purchases of computer hardware and software in all years 
in fiscal  as a result of office relocations during that year  leasehold improvements were a factor 
financing activities the table below aggregates certain line items from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows to present the key items affecting our cash flows from financing activities years ended march  in millions payments on capital leases treasury stock acquired stock options exercised and other  net net cash used in financing activities there were no borrowings during fiscal  and and the main use of cash for financing activities was the acquisition of treasury stock in all years 
during fiscal and  approximately million and million  respectively  shares of treasury stock were purchased 
we plan to increase our treasury stock purchases  subject to market conditions  other possible uses of our cash and our domestic liquidity position 
see market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
the exercise of stock options was the primary source of cash from financing activities 
during fiscal  and  there were million  million and million options exercised  respectively 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion  an increase of million from the march  balance 
as discussed in more detail below  this increase is primarily the 
table of contents result of cash flow generated from operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options during fiscal  partially offset by treasury stock purchases  purchases of property and equipment and software development costs 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  was held in international locations and was largely generated from our international operations 
our international operations have generated approximately million of earnings for which us income taxes have not been recorded 
these earnings would be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the united states 
the potential deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately million  however  we have not provided a deferred tax liability on any portion of the million as we plan to utilize our cash in international locations for foreign investment purposes 
during fiscal and  we utilized cash held in international locations to fund a portion of the magic and calendra purchase prices 
in june  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate approximately million of foreign earnings to take advantage of the american jobs creation act of during fiscal  we executed this plan and repatriated million of qualified earnings under the act 
we recorded an income tax provision of million associated with these earnings 
our marketable securities are primarily investment grade and highly liquid 
a significant dollar portion of our marketable securities is invested in securities with maturities beyond one year  and while typically yielding greater returns  investing in such securities reduces reported working capital 
finance receivables we provide financing on a portion of our sales transactions to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
our practice of providing financing at reasonable interest rates enhances our competitive position 
we participate in established programs with third party financial institutions to sell a significant portion of our finance receivables  enabling us to collect cash sooner and remove credit risk 
the finance receivables are sold to third party financial institutions on a non recourse basis 
we record such transfers of finance receivables to third party financial institutions as sales of such finance receivables when we have surrendered control of such receivables  including determining that such assets have been isolated beyond our reach and the reach of our creditors 
we have not guaranteed the transferred receivables and have no obligation upon default 
during fiscal  and  we transferred million  million and million  respectively  of such receivables through these programs 
the high credit quality of our finance receivables and the existence of these third party facilities extend our ability to offer financing to qualifying customers on an ongoing basis 
however  to meet the needs of our customers we have been providing more licensing options  and this increased focus on flexibility may lead to more customer transactions where cash payments will be received over time 
this flexibility may also reduce our ability to transfer finance receivables in the future and may reduce our cash flow from operations in the near term 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  prior to fiscal  we securitized trade finance receivables from customers with investment grade credit ratings through two commercial paper conduit entities sponsored by third party financial institutions 
in april  one of these third party entities sold its interests in our outstanding securitized finance receivables to the other third party entity  such that the senior interests in all of our outstanding securitized finance receivables were held by one entity 
in december  we purchased the senior interests from this entity at fair value  effectively terminating our securitization arrangements 
we simultaneously transferred the outstanding finance receivables that had previously been securitized to an unaffiliated financial institution on a non recourse basis through our existing financial subsidiary 
this transfer was recorded as a sale in accordance with sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for fiscal  and  approximately  or million   or million  and  or million  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our international subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of each month 
forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound in europe  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region and the israeli shekel 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   we estimate a one day maximum potential loss on our foreign currency exchange instruments of million based on a value at risk var model utilizing monte carlo simulation 
the comparable estimate based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march  was million utilizing the same model 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the average var for the period was 
table of contents million for fiscal and million for fiscal the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately billion at march   and the marketable securities of million primarily represented different types of investment grade debt securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold or the loss in value was deemed to be other than temporary 
based on our consolidated financial position as of march  and our consolidated results of operations and net cash flows for fiscal  we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our future consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
we used a var variance covariance model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
